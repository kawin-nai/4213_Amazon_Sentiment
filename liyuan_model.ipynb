There is nothing self-indulgent about it-  it is about real life- waitresses and dead-end jobs, late-night liquor and broken down cars on bad streets.

The film is filled with lush imagery and great effects (in certain areas anyway-half the time, it's obvious that the production company got lazy). The cast is in fine form, with strange and compelling performances that both complement their characters but also play in the style of a David Lynch film. The music is exceptional (from Toto and Brian Eno), but was poorly edited (like the fx and most of the movie-both TV versions and the theatrical). Length was certainly a problem, but even when Universal made the TV versions without Lynch's consent they still couldn't save what they had already doomed. If they had allowed Lynch to make his film as long as he wanted, God knows it would have been better. All in all, it's not a bad film, it was just poorly done. At least a miniseries is being made (but I have my doubts about that because Lynch's visuals made the film a perfect tie-in with the novel-as I read the book, I could see certain things in my head, and when I saw the film a year or so later I noticed a lot of them had come out).

Surprisingly, it seems very much like  something that should be a classic Floyd piece. David Gilmour's guitar work  is as excellent and as passionate as ever, as is his singing. Nick Mason  and Rick Wright provide a good accompaniment along with the virtual rock  orchestra of drummers and keyboardists, and Tony Levin's bass is great as  always. This album is worth the money and while it may not have the  eerieness or darkness of previous Floyd albums, remember the neurotic if  talented Roger Waters is no longer on board.

It bursts with musical talent and quality, and a lyrical relevancy to some (not all) of the subjects explored. At first the reason I liked &quot;The  Wall&quot; was because of the story behind it. Blending the biographies of  Roger Waters with original Floyd frontman Syd Barrett was an original and  impressive stroke. At the same time, the story is no different from other  rock operas of the time. The character of Pink Floyd is a neurotic guy who  had too much childhood anguish, too much fame, too much sex and drugs, and  he turns it into fascist violence that only gets glorified by the audience  who don't see it as the  lavish show that it's supposed to be, but rather  as a literal translation of hammering the dregs of society...i.e.  &quot;Waiting for the Worms.&quot; Not to say the album is bad.  &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part 1&quot; is simple, yet impressive.  David Gilmour's echoing guitar sound amazing, and the lyrics, while simple,  are very thought-provoking. &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part 2&quot; is  classic, and the ending solo is probably Gilmour's best yet.  &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; &quot;Hey You,&quot; &quot;Young Lust,&quot;  &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky,&quot; and especially &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; are  the finest tracks on the album. &quot;The Wall&quot; was a very chancy and  personal endeavor for Roger Waters, but while it proved successful  commercially, and is full of musical excellence, I think that it's about  time Roger Waters stop bitching about everything. It may provide him with  good musical ideas, but how many different ways can you make subtle hate  rock? Either way, get the album for the music.

The equally  whiny harmonica playing. Most of the Dylan songs I own were recorded by  people other than Dylan.  In my opinion, bands like the Byrds and Fairport  Convention really did justice to his songs.  I know folk purists and Dylan  fanatics won't agree, but after all, one of the reasons that all of these  other bands covered his songs in the first place is this:  They are GREAT  compositions, they could be done better, and if done better, there is a  good chance that they will be hits!

Eadie's account of her near-death experience is fascinating, but very familiar, reading to anyone who has read books such as Life After Life or any Edgar Cayce material.<br />However, I feel that the author  misinterpreted some truths of her experience, and came away with  conclusions that are too grounded in her traditional Christian belief  system.  This will no doubt always be the case to SOME extent, and I do not  blame her for this.<br />As an example, though, she describes a scene where  some souls acting as aides pull back a &quot;curtain&quot; to reveal a  homeless down-and-outer on the street.  It is revealed to the author that  this person's purpose in this life is to teach a particular person, who  walks by him every day on the street, how to feel compassion.  Both souls  were no doubt associated with each other, prior to their current earthly  lives, and the soul that is now playing the role of the homeless person had  chosen to live this hard life for the other person's benefit.  (The other  person would see homeless person every day and it would move him  emotionally to help the homeless person, thus teaching him a valuable  lesson in compassion.)<br />This, in my view, is evidence of reincarnation.  We set up the general situations of these &quot;passion plays&quot; in  advance, and then play them out with our own free will, hoping to learn  lessons (or teach them to others) in the process and advance ourselves  higher in our soul development.  Each lifetime can be viewed as another  class, working toward the final graduation of oneness with God, when we  don't have to come back to the Earth plane for another life lesson.<br />The  author, despite having this revealed to her, nonetheless came to the  conclusion that reincarnation is false; we only live one life.  I just kept  thinking that she was ignoring the evidence to the contrary.  Still, I can  see that if one is a traditional Christian that has rejected the idea of  reincarnation all one's life, then it would be hard to interpret any NDE  experiences without first filtering them through that belief system (or  through any other, for that matter).one's life, then it would be hard to interpret any NDE  experiences without first filtering them through that belief system (or  through any other, for that matter).\", 'review_date': '1998-10-29'}, {'marketplace': 'US', 'customer_id': 52567415, 'review_id': 'RENBUDN33LQG7', 'product_id': 'B000002X4T', 'product_parent': 532526056, 'product_title': 'Volunteers', 'product_category': 'Music', 'star_rating': 4.0, 'helpful_votes': 0.0, 'total_votes': 1.0, 'vine': 'N', 'verified_purchase': 'N', 'review_headline': 'Dated, but still enjoyable', 'review_body': \"This is the Airplane's most dated album.

McCandless, if you remeber, was found by moose hunters in an abandoned bus near Mount McKinley in Alaska where had starved to death.  His parents had not heard of him or from him for two years.      At the outset,the author begins a search for explainations of Chirs Mc Candless, his estrangement from family and Society, and his lonely death.  But as he goes on, Krankauer extends his efforts to a type of which McCandless is but a recent represnetative.  As revealed by Krakauer, McCandless is but one a quietly desparate class of wanders, vagabonds and near mystics that inhabit the roads and backwaters of American, a class which he Krakauer also joined early in his life.  Like many a mystic vagabond, Chris was startllingly brilliant and talented.  But he was a young man incapable of accepting the world for the the rather unethical, sub-moral place it is.  But, rather than rush off on a crusade against injustice he precieved, McCandless truned his sights inward.  It is choice of viewpoint that lead to his death.     A subtile mix of visionary, genius and wounded son, Chris is not all that differrent from the people we all meet.  Half way through the book his image began to blur with memories of a highly talented friend who dropped out of Stanford Grad school for a life as a full time &quot;valley climber&quot; in Yosemite.  But what makes the book so chilling is that we never get a definitive answer as to why Chris followed his ultimately fatal route through life.   McCandless' background is not all that horrible, although it is not strewn with roses, either. Yet many others, with far more reason to follow in his footsteps, avoid the downward slope Chris choose and become happy and productive people.       The disturbing, and unanswered question of this book reamins.  Who are the McCandlesses of the future, where are they now and, for we parents, do we have a Chris McCandless under our own roof?\", 'review_date': '1997-02-03'}]\n",

For those who read it in an hour, I say, &quot;Go back and read it again; you missed the point.&quot; In your haste, you read the words, but ignored the message. In today's society of instant gratification, you saw a small book and decided it required an equally small amount of dedication to reading it and truly listening to what it had to say. Try again, but this time devote a bit more effort to looking beyond the love story between these two characters and feel the heart of Waller's lessons. Life and love are never easy, the most perfect things sometimes come at inopportune times, and sacrifices are made in error that preserve the order of things in some lives while leaving the door on other lives opened but without closure. It is not surprising to me that most people would misinterpret this novel, that they would see only the love story that lies on the surface and ignore the depth of what lies beneath. Most people have never loved in the way that Waller writes about, so to them this will always remain just a &quot;Harlequin romance.&quot; But for those of you out there who have loved someone you shouldn't have at a time that wasn't right, this book will make you understand that what you did wasn't a sin. It was a gift.

However, there are points which I thought were montonous, unnecessary. There is a LONG speech given by the main character, Howard Roark, at the end of the book, mainly to consitute Rand's Ode To Objectivism. I mean, it was really long. If you want to learn Ojectivism, read any of the articles in Philosophy, Who Needs It. I also heard from a friend that there is an even longer speech, almost 50 pages, given by the main character in Atlas Shrugged. I don't think she had, at the point she wrote The Fountainhead, crafted her literary fiction skills perfectly yet.       As far as the philosophy presented in the book, it's rather straightforward and logical: you are fooled by your emotions, and it's an essential to moral survival to observe all things objectively, and to interpret your perceptions both rationally and logically. However, aside from the philosophical interpretation of the world, I disagree with Rand's political viewpoints, for reasons I won't enumerate here, simply to save space and to avoid putting you to sleep. In short, I think her epistemological and metaphysical philosophy contradicts her political.       The major downfall I see in Objectivism, demonstrated most clearly, is that it is a very dogmatic philosophy. Howard Roark's behavior seems logical, but it only goes to show how a real, stoic Objectivist behaves in an esoteric manner, holding their infallible logic aloof from all other 'common people'. With this I disagree, and again, I will not explacate here.       Overall, I give The Fountainhead two thumbs up, simply because it champions logic and reason, and those are two virtues that are entirely too scarce in the modern world. Also, being an aspiring architect, I had a great appreciation for the dominant theme chosen as the vehicle to deliver her message. It is a long book, but is one which you can move through at a good pace, if you understand the basic tenets of Objectivism and don't have a hard time with vocabulary.\", 'review_date': '1997-07-07'}]\n",

Pablo Honey was certainly not a spectacular album, though there were some outstanding songs, a launchpad for future albums, you might say.  The Bends drew upon classic rock for inspiration and managed still to sound wholly new.  The blueprints for OK Computer were encrypted into some of the best song on the Bends such as &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;Nice Dream&quot;, &quot;Just&quot;, &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;.  The band made a hyper-jump into the future to record the magnificent and stunning OK Computer.  I hear people often say that there should have been an album between OK Computer and the Bends, I respond by asking them if they have heard the song &quot;Talk Show Host (R&amp;J Mix)&quot;, that this one song sufficiently forges the stylistic gap between the two separately brilliant albums.     People often ask why I think OK Computer is so unique and spectacular, I ask them to name one other band that sounds like Radiohead on OK Computer, and no one ever can.  In desperation, many name bands that you can tell influenced the band, such as Pink Floyd and Sonic Youth, I concur, but the comparison heads only at the degree of influence.     OK Computer, floats from the speaker and into your head and all of your exposed skin, seeping in through your pores and leaking in a most wonderful sort of infection, that incubates while listening to the album.  When the you reach the last bars of  The Tourist, the last track on OK Computer, you begin to be overtaken by the album.  It has enough texture to steal your emotions away from you, and manipulating them to their own devices.  Ethereal sounds pulsate and lie just beneath the surface of the music.  When I saw them live, the emotive, melacholy beauty of &quot;Exit Music (for a film)&quot;, brought me to tears, I was crying for the song's subjects and because I'd never heard anything so dually sad and beautiful.

In this book Dean Koontz manages to make the characters three dimensional, even  the non-human characters.  As with many of his books, he has included  a dog as one of the main characters in this book, and his ability to  explain canine behavior is very enjoyable.       This book focuses on the escape of two very different creatures from  a laboratory conducting DNA research.  One is a golden retriever with  near human intelligence.  The other is a vicious hybrid creature   genetically engineered to be a terrifying force on the battlefield.  The creature is stalking the dog and killing anything that comes in   its path.  The dog teams up with a paralysingly shy young woman and   a depressed man and turns their life around.  The dog and the couple  are then hunted by the NSA, the creature and a crazed psycopath.\",\n",

There is a plot (of sorts) revolving around the Infinite Jest video (the book's McGuffin), an &quot;entertainment&quot; so completely involving that viewers will starve to death watching it over and over.  However, this is merely the backdrop for a series of stories involving tennis, drug and alcohol recovery, the nature of addiction:  the stories go on and on.<br />The book is VERY long, but  I found myself enthralled by Wallace's storytelling ability - for all of the book's modernist quirks, the good old fashioned storyteller's art saves Infinite Jest time and time again.  As with any book of this length, there are passages the book could probably do without (for my money, a long sequence involving a nuclear war game, Eschaton, would be cut), but I didn't want the book to end.  At 1000+ pages (with footnotes), some of the individual stories are left unresolved, which is perhaps part of the point; I would gladly read a sequel\",\n",

      "            \"review_body\": \"The Doorstop's Here   A hellaciously gifted young writer named David Foster Wallace has just written a   huge new novel called ``Infinite Jest,'' and somebody really ought to smack him with it.          It takes a special kind of nerve to write a book with roughly the mass of a medicine   ball, and then end it so unsatisfyingly that the poor reader perversely finds himself wishing   it longer. But Wallace's limp coda only disappoints because the preceding three-and-a-half   inches of ``Infinite Jest'' have succeeded so well at projecting a world of brain-scalding   complexity.     But when is Wallace carefully teasing out a recurrent motif, it's worth   wondering, and when is he just repeating himself? Literally from first page to last, though,   Wallace has given us a meditation on addiction -- the addiction of a tennis prodigy to   organic narcotics, of a paroled second-story man to inorganic ones, of the terrorist to his   cause, the couch potato to mindless pleasures, and ultimately, the unkickable addiction of   readers to all those old storytelling conventions Wallace gleefully blows up like a rotten kid   cherry-bombing an electric train.     The biggest addiction on display here may be Wallace's own, to writing, a habit so   consuming that the only way for him to shake it is with an abrupt, cold-turkey ending.   Luckily, savingly, ``Infinite Jest'' has a second serve to fall back on: its authentically   hysterical, drink-milk-at-your-peril humor.     Here's Wallace doing an overzealous high-school tennis announcer: ``Lamont Chu disembowelled Charles Pospisilova 6-3, 6-2; Peter Beak spread   Ville Dillard on a cracker like some sort of hors d'oeuvre and bit down 6-4, 7-6...while   Gretchen Holt made PW's Tammi Taylor-Bing sorry her parents were ever in the same   room together 6-0, 6-3...''     This is comic overkill of the wettest possible water, the sort of stuff good for   reading aloud to one's more indulgent friends -- ``Wait, just one more'' -- taking care to   leave out expressions like ``SACPOP'' that Wallace doesn't even see fit to explain until 100   pages later, in a slapstick set piece so funny you forgive him immediately. The passage is   also symptomatic of one of Wallace's bad habits, namely, too many characters too quickly   introduced and never adequately differentiated -- not a bad metaphor for the whole high   school experience, but also a hallmark of too many fat books one finds in used-book stores   with their first couple of chapters thoroughly begrimed and the rest in near-mint condition.     ``Infinite Jest'' should find a kinder posterity in just about any near future except the   one where it takes place, sometime early in the next century. Books don't count for much   in Wallace's dystopia, and the only one mentioned is a copy of William James' ``Varieties   of Religious Experience'' long since hollowed out as a stashbox.     Just how early in the next century this is can't be pinned down, as the Gregorian   calendar has long since made way for Subsidized Time, which takes the concept of   commercial sponsorship to its logical terminus by rechristening 2001 or 2020 A.D. or   whatever, as the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken, the Year of the Depend Adult   Undergarment, &amp;c. Like much else in the book, this tactic is mysterious at first, a scream   when Wallace lets you in on the joke, and kind of a pain by the time he beats it into the   ground. Mercifully, he starts abbreviating the years after a while, then changes his mind   and goes right back to spelling them out.     Approriately for a book about addiction, ``Infinite Jest'' is told largely in flashbacks.   The novel begins with Hal Incandenza, its tennis prodigy antihero, suffering a mysterious   seizure during an Arizona college interview early in the Year of Glad, as in trashbags. We   then backpedal to the rigorously regimented Enfield Tennis Academy near Boston, Hal's   and our home off and on for the bulk of the book. E.T.A is the brainchild of Hal's late   father, J.O., a man of high and wide attainments, last but not least of them artfully cutting a   large hole into the door of a microwave oven, inserting his head, and letting it rip.     J.O.'s place on campus and in Hal's mother's bed has fallen to a shady relation,   giving rise to the suspicion, reinforced by the book's title, that what we've really signed on   for is some hypermodern pastiche of ``Hamlet.'' This holds water as far as it goes, viz.,   until Wallace starts cross-cutting between the Academy and its Enfield neighbor, a   dilapidated halfway house for dipso- and other maniacs. At this point, a fresh scenario   pokes its head out of the verbal thicket -- that ``Hamlet'' is just a red herring, and that   Wallace is really concocting a sort of elephantine variation on ``Entropy,'' Thomas   Pynchon's classic short story of contrasted chaos and regimentation.     Wallace's other novel, ``The Broom of the System,'' has already elicited cries of   ``Pynchonesque!'' from diverse quarters, some of them, to be sure, using the adjective in its   usual sense, i.e., as reviewer's code for ``I didn't finish it,'' others so besotted with Pynchon   that they see his scat everywhere, but a few finding genuine similarities. Both men do share   a head for science, a stomach for gross-out humor, a great ear, and a soft spot for the word   ``maffick,'' but Wallace definitely has the lower opinion of sloth.     This emerges from a third thread in ``Infinite Jest,'' one that pulls it beyond the   realm of homage to either Shakespeare or Pynchon. Hal's father, during his avant-garde   filmmaker phase, has somehow made a movie so enjoyable as to be 100% lethal. All   viewers unfortunate enough to catch even a snippet of this mortally popular production,   which ironically shares its title with the novel, at once live only to see it again and again,   lapsing into a persistent vegetative state from which only drool-drowning will ever deliver   them. All copies have now gone missing, and the post-NAFTA Organization of North   American Nations (O.N.A.N.) is ineptly racing to find them before they can fall into the   Wrong Hands, namely those of a splinter group of legless Quebecois separatists in   wheelchairs.     If this starts to sound a mite daffy, it's also deadly serious. Like ``1984'' and ``A   Clockwork Orange,'' both of which he unmistakably invokes, Wallace's critique of a future   society whose only grail has become the hangoverless bender, the infinite jest -- the   neverending Year of Glad -- rings so true and contemporary it's almost late.     In a way, of course, it is. Everybody from Neil Postman in ``Amusing Ourselves to   Death'' to 10,000 Maniacs in ``Candy Everybody Wants'' has tilled this ground before.   What keeps it fresh is Wallace's prose style, a compulsively footnoted amalgam of   stupendously high-toned vocabulary and giddy low-comedy diction, coupled to a sense of   syntax so elongated that he can seem to go for days without surfacing. At times he appears   determined to end each sentence with a preposition or not at all, with perhaps the slight   edge going to not at all. A Wallace sentence finally draws to a close amid reluctance and   relief, like a hitting streak. Half the time you'll want to pitch the damn book clear into the   next room, with or without benefit of doorway, but the other half you can actually feel   your attention span stretching back out to where it belongs.     Then, contrary to the occasional renegade suspicion, it ends. Little gets resolved,   least of all a reason for Hal's first-chapter seizure, although at least three good guesses   come to mind. Several well-developed characters and one improbably touching romance all   come to naught. Pynchonesque, some will say, but with Pynchon, he's playing with the   whole idea of narrative closure, not thumbing his nose at you for giving a damn.      Finishing ``Infinite Jest,'' one feels less played with thantoyed with. Still, better to   be toyed with by a genius than pandered to by some second-rater who'd write a few   hundred pages and give up. And Wallace has a toybox to do Pandora proud.\",\n",

With over 250,000 copies in print and a meteoric rise to No. 1 on Business Weeks's hardcover business books best-seller list, this revenge of the cubicle dwellers is a mix of cartoon strips and Scott Adams' succinct observations describing ridiculous company policies and dysfunctional management practices. Not surprisingly, the message is coming in loud and clear in high places. Reengineering guru Michael Hammer has jumped on the Dilbert bandwagon by suggesting that &quot;there is more truth in one volume of Dilbert than there is in 10 volumes of Harvard Business School case studies.&quot; Dilbert pokes fun at organizations where nothing ever really changes except the business buzzwords and corporate slogans. Perhaps that's the secret of the strip's success, both in the U.S. and abroad. &quot;Everybody thinks Dilbert is making fun of somebody else's situation,&quot; suggests Adams, an ex-Pacific Bell cubicle dweller for the past nine years until he was &quot;downsized&quot; recently when his department came under new management. Is &quot;bitter irony&quot; the right phrase? Or perhaps the &quot;system getting even?&quot; In the book's introduction, under the heading &quot;The Evolution of Idiots&quot;, Adams expounds: Theory of Evolution (Summary) First, there were some amoebas. Deviant amoebas adapted better to the environment, thus becoming monkeys. Then came Total Quality Management. I'm leaving out some detail, but the theory itself also has a few holes that are best left unquestioned.

This, I believe, qualifies me to say that I have read the book from cover to cover and back again.  The actual e-mail that Adams has received from readers about their work situation (ie corporate culture) and dumb things done by &quot;superiors&quot; is priceless. Adams has a flair for understanding the world of work from the end user perspective.  There are numerous classic Dilbert strips as well.  Some of the chapters are a bit too long and drawn out, but overall this is an amusing book.  I recommend giving it anonymously to your boss for Christmas.

Scott Morton (1994, McGraw-Hill), &quot;Japan: Its History and Culture,&quot; pages 118-119:   &quot;It was by a strange accident that he [Ieyasu, or 'Yoshi Toranaga']   found one of his most valuable experts, a shipbuilder, Will Adams,  pilot-major of a small Dutch flotilla, who was one of the  few survivors of a typhoon which severely damaged the flagship,   the 'Liefde' [Erasmus]. ...&quot; Adams was from Kent, England. In his youth, he  was an apprentice to a shipwright. Adams warned Ieyasu about Spain's  and Portugal's desire to propagate Catholocism into Japan, and said that  other nations (England and Holland) were interested only in trade.   Now, for what became of Blackthorne after Toranaga's victory at   Sekigahara... he acquired a large estate in Japan, and married a  Japanese woman. Adams never returned to England. He died in Japan,   laden with honors (presumably from Ieyasu), but still longing for  his homeland. There is a monument to Will Adams in Japan, near the sea.   Ieyasu, possibly because of Adams' influence, expelled the Christain  missionaries a while later: Lord Kiyama (Takayama Ukon) left Japan in  exile to Manila, where he died shortly afterward.

As herione Oedipa Maas travels up and down the Californian coast,  attempting to uncover a bizarre conspiracy, she unravels  a new reality that challenges us to question ours.

Tuchman jumps from one topic to another,   creating a loose (even non-existant) organization which  leaves the reader lost and confused.  Tuchman seems to   think that her reader already knows the information she  is trying to convey.  It is almost as if Tuchman sat down  at a typewriter and asked herself, &quot;what do I know about  medival European history?&quot; and then wrote whatever came to  her mind, when ever it came to her mind.  With the exception  of the 5th chapter, which details the death and suffering  of millions during the various plagues, the novel is as dry  as sand.  The book's only merit is its informational value,  which if the reader can follow, or for that matter even  stay awake, he may gain something from this book.\",\n",

If you like to read books you will probably be swept away  by this novel, the first of a thankfully long series by   Patrick O'Brian.    The subjects are the British Navy of the Napoleonic Wars and  two men: Aubrey -- a naval officer and (one quickly assumes)  one of the best sailors who has ever lived and Maturin -- a  physician and &quot;agent extraordinaire&quot; who seems to be  bent  on giving Thomas Jefferson a run for his money as  the man who knows the most of everything that could  be known.    O.K. so you don't like war, sailing, or the early 19th century.  After a few minutes reading this book, you will.  Even lazy  readers (myself for example) will suddenly develop a great  interest in the rigging of three-masted sailing vessels of  the era.      And did I mention, color, romance, and character   development?  A lot of natural science as well.    The publisher offers the whole set of Aubrey/Maturin  novels in hardback for a package price because many  who read the first will be tempted to just buy them  all and avoid any waits in between.  I'm certainly  tempted.\",\n",

From the standpoint of a recently undergraduated copywriter in need of a solid vision for the future, Siddharthas trials and eventual spiritual grounding and discovery are meaningful and, at last, comforting revelations that have forced me to examine my own spirituality, materialism, romances, and values.<br /><br />The importance of observing and feeling everything with an open heart and mind while following your own deepest inclinations and directions is the only way to truly determine where you belong, Siddharthas words and actions inform the reader.  From forest to town to river, Siddhartha is welcome and loved for he learns from and gives to all that come to know him.  He gives questions to a spiritual leader and passion to a woman.  He gives success to a business and instruction to a friend.  And finally, Hesses creation gives the reader inspiration and motivation for a closer look at every river along the way to greater self-understanding.<br /><br /> In honesty, when I was first commissioned to read Siddhartha I glanced through the first few pages and put it down for reasons I cannot recall.  Maybe I was too enveloped in the adventures of Henry Chinaski or engaged with the Coma Baby.  I cannot remember.  Anyway, I wish I had read the story then and I am glad I have read it now.\",\n",

Ten-year old Tonya Hailey is brutally raped and almost killed by two drunken rednecks; perhaps the saddest and hardest part to get through with the addition of little Tonya's dream of her father running to get her. After this horrid crime is committed, Tonya's father, Carl Lee exacts vengeance on the two rednecks, and kills them. He is put on trial, and lawyer Jake Brigance is introduced to us. He takes Carl Lee's case and must face his hated enemy, Rufus Buckley, in court. The days leading to the trial are filled with KKK threats, riots between blacks and the KKK, and several other chills and spills. Finally, the trial comes and the small town of Clanton, where the trial is held, is occupated by journalists, soldiers, KKK members, and thousands of blacks, as they all wait for the verdict on the edge of their seats..\",\n",

The   film by Stanley Kubrick is equally disturbing, but, as   Burgess himself notes in the introduction to this edition,  leaves off the crucial twenty-first chapter, a chapter that  is vital to the book both for its numerical significance  (twenty-one being considered the age of maturity), and its  philosophical poignance.\",\n",

It is as if Ginsberg broke free from   the word-form lines that confine thought and   let his untampered ideas flow free onto the page  and then just leave them there to reform themselves  in the readers mind exactly as Ginsberg thought  them.  He not only cast his un-strained thoughts   onto the page but also poured them into a mind-  breath mould that allowed them to be measured   by each breath the mind takes, re-inhaling the  glorious fumes with the base repitition of &quot;Who...&quot;  This not only gives the poem a measurable quality but  also an ethereal quality because it is not measured  physically but with each breath of the mind.  The second stanza is one of industrial wickedness  and power-hunger as well as divine-right rule and  god-like evil.  It shows Moloch as The Tyrant and  money, corruption and greed as his arms, legs and blood.  The whole poems shines like a glossy white garage  on a soot covered hill.\",\n",

The view the reader  gets of Ender in Ender's Game is only a misleading scratch  in the surface of this caring, human-nature genius. This  book has more originality and drive than Xenocide. Speaker   for the Dead is very different than Ender's Game, it is not  another &quot;war&quot; book, it is a &quot;serious&quot; book, and definitely  worth reader AFTER Ender's Game    the adult Ender.\",\n",

Sharing the spotlight are the  fascinating flora and fauna young Gerald stumbles across  on his island.  Even if you thought you couldn't stand   Biology as a student in school, Durrell's descriptions are  so beautifully written, each discovery so exquisitely etched  that you cannot but wonder at the beauty of Nature - and  the amazing gift of prose that Durrell, a naturalist by  profession, brings to this unforgettable book.  It makes you  thirst for more of the same, and happily for us, Durrell has  written several books.. worthy sequels to this tour de   force.\",\n",

Krakauer's own autobiographical chapters illuminate his own   long entanglement with risk, but tend to break up the main   story.

It<br /> stands the test of time well, and opens up the door to a<br /> different way of viewing reality, as told in lyrical and<br /> loving language.

The backbone of the plot can be explained in a sentence and while it  might have supported a short story (the resolution  of the story is predictable half way through)  it's too flimsy a frame for a novel.  The  no-gray-zone series of leadership-lesson episodes read like Card wrote a story to the  table of contents in a US Army basic training  manual.  My only explanation for the book's popularity is  that it hit a sweet spot of readers with their hands on  the joystick,   hungry for a rationalization  fantasy for the hours and quarters that they  squander in video game parlors mastering   Missile Command.\",\n",

The book describes the life of a brilliant Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and shows him as a completely accessible human being.  He gives a marvelously entertaining account of some of the experiments he conducted while a college undergraduate - all of them completely understandable to a layperson.  But the book continues through his adult life: his attempts to learn Japanese, his experiences as a patron and legal defender of a local strip club, his encounters with military stuffed shirts during WWII, and dozens of other adventures.  If you want to convince yourself or someone else that it's possible to be a brilliant scientist and a real human being simultaneously, then this is the book.
