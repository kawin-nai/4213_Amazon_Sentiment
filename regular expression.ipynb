    "## Regular Expression, why so useful\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will briefly introduce the magic of regular expression (regex). If you wanted to learn more about regex (it is very tricky to learn regex. But super useful once mastered!), please check this website https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.regular-expressions.info/__;!!KjDnqvtInNPT!2ZXgwQtzCsk1BnDpqmlXIrpYT0hH5wOfEU3ytm2tDkmicqyf87Q4VVooF0OBJ-H3D_I$ . It can also serves as a handbook going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression (regex) is a group of characters or symbols which is used to find a specific pattern in a text. It is a universial tool that can be deploy in many programming or nonprogramming languages (Python, R, Html). It also be generallized to all coding schemes such 'utf-8', latin, etc. It can even match emojis and urls. \n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to master it during this course. But at least know its existence and extent of power. Ask Google or search  https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.regular-expressions.info/__;!!KjDnqvtInNPT!2ZXgwQtzCsk1BnDpqmlXIrpYT0hH5wOfEU3ytm2tDkmicqyf87Q4VVooF0OBJ-H3D_I$  for answers if you need help in the future.
