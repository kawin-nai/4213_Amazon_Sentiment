          "The Razer Arochi V2 is a great performer and looks nice with other white accessories. I picked this one up for my ASUS G14 and it has worked flawlessly. The build quality, responsiveness, and battery life are superb. I also have a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed that I use with my main desktop and the Arochi keeps up with it in terms of performance. The only complaint I have is my own fault as I have bigger hands and the Arochi V2 is on the more compact size of mice so it can get uncomfortable for extended use periods.",
          "More like \"like new\" than \"buy new\". Maybe it's the lack of care in the Amazon warehouse (since it's been shipped from there). The packaging was ripped the seal sticker looked opened and the mouse padding at the bottom was....dirty. Is this item presentable to gift? Not really. Is it still functional? Yeah at least as of right now day 1 of recieving the item.It's not ergonomic to me. But I have small hands,that the mouse is perfect fit.The latency is minimal to almost unnoticeable, I usually don't go for wireless mouses because of latency issues.I'll have to see the battery issue the longer I use it.",
          "",
          "I got this mouse in June 2021 after switching from the Logitech G502 Hero and I've loved it ever since. The mouse is much smaller in comparison to the G502 and does require getting used to but I have medium sized hands and it still feels really comfortable to use. For a note I use a semi fingertip/palm grip where the back of the mouse rests right in the little curve right by the base of the thumb on the palm (that's the best i got).You can use it with with AA or AAA batteries and generally I get like two-three weeks off that one battery depending on how frequently its on. I generally play games 6/7 days of the week and most sessions are at least 6 hours and the mouse has never disappointed me in terms of performance and responsiveness.The mouse is quite durable and has fallen from about 3 feet a few times mainly off my desk at home and at work and there is no dents or signs of damage. My only negative might be that the small shape can feel a little uncomfortable if you don't have a proper space as its uniform on both sides however I will be getting another once this mouse finally gives out.",
          "I've been using this mouse for about 3-4 months now and I'm already looking for another one, this mouse is definitely a keeper, I just didn't think I would have to shelve it so soon. It feels really good to use, it just disconnects sometimes and that can be really annoying when I'm trying to play an FPS. It'll happen like once or twice in an hour, not super frequent but still an issue none the less.",
          "The mouse is light and quite accurate as desired, but here are the issues that keep it from being a 5-star rating for me.  1. Signal strength isn't great.  I have USB 3.0 ports on both sides of my large laptop.  If I use a port on the far side, the signal drops in and out giving me an unsteady mouse.  Of note, this is 2.4Ghz wifi, not bluetooth).  2. The top shell is a single piece instead of having a break before the actual mouse buttons area.  So, pressure from my upper palm will occasionally press the buttons (mostly the right button) without intending to.  Many mice use this one-piece design, but the best mice have the palm plastic separated from the mouse key plastic. 3. The laser position is almost perfectly centered.  This may make it a better ambi design, but for a right-hander, having the sensor ever so slightly to the outside right of the mouse body gives more ergonomic/precise control due to the biological shape of a hand.  4. The mouse clicks are sort of obnoxiously loud.  The center wheel and back/forward buttons seem fine to me, but the main mouse buttons are very loud.  I don't have to have silent, but they seem about 2x louder than a normal mouse to me.  In summation, these are the minor \"issues.\"  Overall, I still very much like the mouse and continue to use it as my primary.  It's not as good as my wired gaming mouse, but the wireless ones are getting much closer.  At its low price-point, this is hard to beat.",
          "Size is a bit smaller so be aware, for me that wasn\u2019t a problem.The click sounds is way too loud, that\u2019s the reason I take 1 star.Other bad thing is the buttons on the left are quite sensitive and you might press them by mistake sometimes.Very pretty. Easy to clean. I liked.",
          "I had the Razer basilisk X, the battery life claimed was about half of this mice. However, the basilisk can do dpi 2250, where most of the Logitech mice can also do. This mouse however can only do 2200 or 2300. I prefer 2250 for both work and play. The claimed battery on this mice was also misleading because it came with a Energizer ultimate lithium. Every other wireless mice I\u2019ve gotten came with the standard copper top. I put a 100% charged Eneloop pro to the mice, and immediately it shows 75% battery left.I\u2019m sure if I put an Energizer lithium in to my Logitech 305s be much lighter.But overall, this mouse is still a keeper. Fits my hand just fine.  Dual battery is cool, but just a gimmick IMO.",
          "I use this on both my Mac and PC. The mouse is light, compact, responsive and comfortable to use with my medium sized hands. I use this for gaming on my PC, productivity work on my work Surface Pro X, and creative and general work on my MacBook Pro. Everything works great with the dongle.  I also like the fact that I can easily replace it with a AA or AAA battery, and I have a lot of rechargeable NiMH batteries available at home.The only reason why this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bluetooth connectivity is a bit wonky if your PC goes from sleep to wake and there is a 50% chance that it won't reconnect, and you have to turn the mouse on and off again to get it to work. Never had an issue with any of my logitech mouse, and even Razer's keyboards.",
          "I needed a mouse that was small factor and worked well with my MacBook Air and this one at least works. I like that it has the toggle on the bottom for both bluetooth or connecting by usb dongle (which isn't my option I use with a MAC).Ive used many mice over the years and this is not my favorite as it is very simple, no lights, feels cheaply made but then again it works which is a lot more then I can say for two that I had (for my PC's) that I could not use with my new MacBook...",
          "Been using this mouse for like idk? 4-5 months i think and I love this, I have changed the battery twice, but it does warn u, but still I LOVE IT, not much a huge like gamer girl, but this is perfect if u have small hands, and if u like a cordless theme",
          "I absolutely love my Razer Orochi V2 Mobile Wireless Gaming Mouse! The sleek design and compact size make it perfect for on-the-go gaming, and the wireless connectivity ensures that I can game without any pesky cables getting in the way. The button placement is intuitive and comfortable, and the tracking is extremely precise, which is essential for fast-paced games. Overall, I highly recommend the Razer Orochi V2 Mobile Wireless Gaming Mouse to any gamer looking for a high-performance, portable mouse. It's definitely worth the investment!",
          "When I first opened the package I was surprised by how small and light the mouse was, it is definitely not for palm users or claw users with large hands.The claimed battery life is what sold me, and it seems to be keeping true to that, I\u2019ve had it for about 2 weeks now and the battery Is at 98%.After getting used to the size of the mouse, it is pretty comfortable for everyday use, definitely prefer it over my wired mouse, the wire would always get in the way of things. I got this mouse at a discounted price because of prime day, so I\u2019m content with my purchase, however, if your looking for a wireless mouse for heavy gaming only, and you're paying the regular price, it is not worth it, get a bigger mouse.",
          "This is far best mouse I ever tried 5 stars all the way bruv",
          "I bought this for a living room gaming setup.  Overall the mouse is great, but I was surprised by how lightweight it is (maybe I should read the description better).  If you want a lightweight mouse then you'll probably love it.",
          "I personally own a razer viper ultimate, but I decided to get this mouse because of it's ability to switch between two wireless modes (bluetooth & hyperspeed/2.4 ghz).  This makes it really convenient for me to switch between my computer and my laptop.  There's a light indicator at the top to show which wireless mode you are in while it tries to connect (blue = bluetooth, green = hyperspeed/2.4 ghz), the light disappears shortly after it's connected.Honestly, while I really like my viper ultimate, I somehow enjoy this one a lot more.  Even though this mouse is really lightweight, it still feels very premium because of the texture and overall build quality.  I'm currently using this mouse with an AAA battery, but I'll probably switch to an AA battery later for slightly more weight and longer battery life.I didn't expect to like the size that much, but it actually feels incredibly good for a small mouse.  I still think it'd be more perfect for my medium sized hands if it was a little longer, but it already feels excellent in my hand.Pros:2 wireless modes (bluetooth & hyperspeed/2.4 ghz)Can use either AA or AAA batteryLightweight: 73g (with AA battery) or 68g (with AAA)Nice textureTactile buttonsLeft & right clicks sound softer than my viper ultimateSmall form factorSide buttons are easy to clickCons:Not rechargeableMay be uncomfortable for big hands",
          "Coming from the the $20 wired razer deathadder, the orochi v2 changed my life forever. When I built my PC I was using the previously mentioned mouse and I thought it was all I would ever need. I thought that wireless and lightweight mouses were pointless. It was until my scroll wheel broke on that mouse that I decided that I needed a new one. I figured I would invest in a mouse that was a bit more expensive, and perhaps even a wireless one if it was in my budget. It came down to the logitech g305 and this orochi v2. I ended up settling for the orochi v2 because it was smaller, and most reviewers compared it to some of the higher ends mouses on the market- if I recall correctly, the specs may also be a bit better than the g305.This mouse would change my life forever. Not only is it so light, but the pads on the bottom made moving it across my mousepad so effortless. seemingly frictionless.  I felt as if I had become one with the mouse itself. It includes a AA lithium battery that is still running even after two months of extensive use. It feels great to not have to worry about cables being caught onto the edge of my desk. I should mention that the sensor under the mouse seems to be positioned a bit higher than a typical mouse would, so it may take a bit of getting used to for wrist motion. The mouse is amazing nonetheless, and I finally came to understand what it means to have a \"good mouse\". for $40 you cannot beat that price. get it.",
          "This is a nice travel mouse for gaming or general use.  I appreciate that it has dual power (AA or AAA battery just not both at same time).  This way you can use easily obtainable ready to go power w/o worrying about charge levels all the time.I have relatively large hands and I can grip it on the sides and rest a comfortable portion of my palm on it.  It is very light so it is easy to move around.  Some gamers may not like that but there are always full size competition mice for those who prefer that.It is Bluetooth or 2.5Ghz modes.  BT is most compatible with many full size computers, laptops, tablets, ECT.  2.5Ghz (USB-A removable dongle included under the hood next to battery compartment) is for more speed/accuracy while gaming.Speaking of the battery compartment, it is under an easy to remove top friction fit cover.  You may use AA or AAA Alkaline or Lithium batteries.  Battery life is typically twice as long on BT.  And we are talking a couple of months to half a year depending which size and chemistry you load up.I accessorized mine by adding the \"Razer Universal Grip Tape for Gaming Peripherals\" for better grip.  And to protect it in my backpack, I use the \"L LTGEM EVA Hard Case for Razer Orochi V2\" clamshell case. (Both of these accessories also avail on Amazon).Overall button feel/placement and the scroll wheel feel really good for travel sized device.  I think you'll like it so go ahead and pick one up.",
          "Absolutely LOVE Razer products. Own the Viper Ultimate Mouse, the Razer Blade 15 and a few other Accessories. The Orochi Mouse continues the tradition of high build quality, responsive precision, and best of all, this is BT and 2.4 so I can use it with my iPad and Razer Blade.",
          "UPDATE: I had to buy one for myself mines the red with a lil akira theme mixed in. These things Are too easy to mod and with a lithium battery hard to beat for competitive FPS. Bought this as a birthday present for the wife. I have a G305 which she likes so I figured it was on sale for the same price so I scooped a white one so we didn\u2019t just have two G305\u2019s. I have slightly larger than average hands and I think I prefer the ergs on the smaller razer. I do play claw/ some fingertip. It feels lighter than my g305 more nimble. I did however slap a AAA lithium in a AA adapter. Really enjoyed that I could completely tear the mouse down for customization (There is just something about having to peel off perfectly good mouse skates to get at some screws that would make me not even want to mod it till it was time to change out skates. That\u2019s like a whole year for me.) so anyways thank you razer truly a great idea. Also clicks are nice I like them better than the g305. Used briefly haven\u2019t noticed any skipping or lag. Thanks.",
          "To start off my hand size is 17x10 cm so I have \u201cmedium\u201d sized hands and the difference between this and the viper ultimate was night and day for me. The sensor felt really nice and my first time using it I broke all my Kovaaks and sim labs records. I used a fingertip grip mostly but sometimes claw and it perfect for both. If you use a palm grip you will need very small hands for that. I can Palm it just a little bit. I\u2019ve never had my sim in games feel so familiar. I\u2019ve used the pulsefire haste, Aeros 3 wireless (2022), the razer viper ultimate, and the deathadder v2 pro and this is just the best mouse I have ever used. The sensor implementation feels very nice and the side buttons are very nice and clicks (a huge problem on the razer viper ultimate) the feet feel amazing. I think this is my endgame I couldn\u2019t recommend it more.",
          "I had the original Orochi and want to put this out there for all those interested in this mouse due to using the original: This mouse is not the same, and you may be disappointed, but it will get the job done and you will get used to the differences quickly.Pro: The mouse is very lightweight and still small in size.Con: It's larger than its predecessor, and significantly more lightweight. The weight of the previous generation helped balance its small size and provide a more solid, intentional feeling during quick movements and actions. Additionally, the body is entirely plastic, while V1 felt to be a combination of plastic and aluminum. Maybe I owned a special top cover, but the added weight and heft of the materials made V1 feel like a more solid, long-lasting piece of hardware. I am honestly disappointed with how cheap and plastic it feels.Pro: The body style is very similar to V1.Con: The body style is different enough from V1 that my hands and eyes notice. The surface is pitted and textured like more common budget mice. V1's surface texture was matte, slick, and without a strong texture. The missing hard lines on the body provide less resting places for my fingers.Pro: the DPI switches (like its predecessor) can be custom mapped to another button so they aren't in your way.Con: The mouse only has two programmable buttons within quick reach of a right-hand user. There are no left-handed thumb-adjacent programmable buttons. An additional, programmable button is available behind the scroll wheel, but its placement makes it impractical for anything other than a DPI switch for me personally.Pro: The 2.5ghz and bluetooth connectivity options are not only convenient, but extremely quick and reliable. The 2.5ghz dongle is hidden within the battery compartment and easy to keep track of. The lack of a wired connection option means I don't have to hunt down a proprietary, strangely-shaped cable (from the V1) to play my games.Con: The inability to choose a wired connection makes this a MASSIVE feature loss compared to V1.Pro: Battery life is incredible. Battery percentage will display within Windows 10 when connected via bluetooth. Have not yet tested to see if that's true on MacOS systems, but it typically is.Con: V2 did not come with a rechargable feature. V1 did not either. This was a missed opportunity for Razer, but may have been a deliberate choice to keep V2 at a reduced weight.Pro: The lack of RGB lighting increases overall battery life over the V1.Con: V1's scroll wheel RGB was pleasant. I would trade battery life for RGB, but I can live without it.I love this mouse, but I find myself rejecting it because of the variances with the V1 I came from. The V1 Orochi was my daily mouse for nearly 12 years and I sure miss it.",
          "The REVIEW was intended to review the mouse (which below), but here some context for people who are planning to buy used from Amazon Warehouse (which could save a broke college students some money).The picture review: So I purchase this mouse used, under the \u201clike-new\u201d condition. At the beginning, the description was \u201ccome with original packaging\u201d and since it was mark as \u201clike-new\u201d I truly thought it maybe just a mouse that got return for some reason, which as customers we do that all the time. So I did not expect the mouse to come with no original packaging,  the mouse was literally wrap in bubble wrap. Then just a look I notice how much dust stuck in the mouse, as if it has been using under a construction site. This mouse is definitely being used for at least a couple of months or more. Then it also arrive with the battery dead. I would not be uncomfortable if I was purchased under \u201cused\u201d rather than \u201clike-new\u201d condition. I quickly chat with a representative and they hence the changes the description. But honestly that was the first time I experienced such a bizarre buying experience from Amazon. The representative did such a quick job, honestly props to their customers services team.The mouse review: The mouse is nice. I was hesitant into buying such an expensive mouse for works, school and occasionally gaming, but the mouse feel super nice in my hand. Overall a pleasant experience with just using the mouse for a couple of hours. I will come back to review once I knows how long the battery last.",
          "I really like how the mouse is light and slim, well built. However, I was trying to use it on a laptop with other wireless devices and it just does not work well via bluetooth - it works like it's a low quality sensor. When I connect it through the built in 2.4 GHz plug, it works perfect (although not using dongle with an USB port was the main reason I looked at it).Finally, if you, like me, were looking for a bluetooth mouse that would save you a port - this one did not work for me (while using a wireless keyboard and headphones).",
          "looks great, has great battery life fora gaming mouse, its fast and very responsive. great for people who use the palm grip. very affordable for what it offers.",
          "I keep this in my bag for my laptop and table.Having Bluetooth or USB makes it work on everything.The battery life being great is a big bonus.",
          "Aside from it being lighter than I am used to, this mouse works really well. It is precise, the connection via bluetooth is so much better than any other wireless options, and it fits in my small hands perfectly. I would recommend this mouse to digital artists and gamers alike.",
          "Small mouse. Great for those who use Finger Tip Grip. Not for those who like to palm grip for stability. Claw grip? May be for those with smaller hands. Most of the movement/grip is focused on the side thumb grip and fingers tips. For FPS gaming, if you\u2019re a wrist aimer, this mouse is not for youGood click on the buttons. If you focus on the top end of left and right buttons, can feel a bit spongy--Battery:To reach 920hr max you need to use lithium (vs Alkaline) AA battery while using Bluetooth (vs USB dongle)Half battery life for each of the following:  Alkaline, AAA battery, and USB dongle. So, if you use all 3 you\u2019re looking at roughly 115hoursAlkaline is more common and cheaper than Lithium even if when you buy multiple alkaline. Bluetooth is not good for gaming especially if you play competitive and/or a game with fast reactionary time as you can get spin outs and delayed inputs.Make sure you put the USB dongle in the USB3.0 port (one with blue accents) and not the normal one (black accent) or you\u2019ll get more latency issues60g weight without batteryUse AAA or AA batteryBattery insert diagonal, giving it good weight distributionAA is heavier but weight more centered. AAA is lighter and has more weight at back end of the mouse.If you want your AAA to have more centered weight; you can purchase a AAA to AA adapterNo rbg lighting. There is a minor light for low battery indicator, and dpi cycle indicatorSemi ambidextrous? It\u2019s ambidextrous if you only use main left and right mouse buttons. Side buttons on the left side mainly right handers as there\u2019s no right-side buttons.  Also the thumb groove is only on the left side if the mouseAble to customize buttons. Saves on mouse, not dedicated to a specific computer, and no need to keep computer software open while usingI use this for casual gaming, and travel. Personally, still prefer wired mouse for competitive gaming, and vertical mouse for work, internet browsing, and productivityOverall, good mouse if you check all the boxes: Use fingertip grip, right hander (if you use side buttons), and not wrist aimer for FPS games.",
          "It fits my hand size perfectly. The curved shape makes my hand hold on to more well. I really like it :))).",
          "To start I would like to say that I have owned several wireless \"gaming\" mice as well as many wired \"gaming\" mice. This is my new favorite. Razer deathadder, several logitech and steelseries.The response time with the usb receiver is so fast you would think it is wired. It is small, though shaped perfectly to hold comfortably and confidently with your fingertips and upper palm. I didn't think I would like the shape but I ended up loving it. It is very light and glides on the mousepad with such little effort. The tracking is smooth and consistent. The lift off distance is incredibly small.My aim in every game is so much more consistent and effortless. I didn't think a mouse could make such a difference after having so many good mice. And its wireless! Amazing.The included battery has lasted many moths so far, more than satisfactory.One issue I have is that the side buttons are sticky. This is out of the box new, nothing spilt on it or worn out. If you let the mouse sit overnight and then press the side buttons in the morning they have a strange resistance. After a few presses they loosen up. Its very strange. You can still use them when you need but the feedback is inconsistent as a result. This is probably just my unit but it may happen to you too.",
          "I used this mouse while in bed when I feel like gaming and it's amazing. I have small hands and it fits perfect. It's smooth feels comfortable and worth the price. I love this little mouse for in bed gaming.",
          "almost 5 stars. great small shape, amazing minmum lateness and insane battery life. but only a few months in, the scroll wheel started rattling.",
          "I was very worried that this mouse was going to be uncomfortably small. I was going from a larger mouse so it was a big downsize. It definitely took a few uses to get used to it but once I got my grip it\u2019s been comfortable. I\u2019ve had no comfort issues even after multi-hour gaming sessions. I actually got this and the Razer Viper Ultimate and choose this one over the RVU because the RVU had some right clicking misclick problems. This mouse is very responsive. I use the 2.4 receiver for gaming on one computer and switch to Bluetooth for my work computer. It takes like 30 seconds to connect to theBluetooth but that could be an issue with my work computer, it\u2019s nothing special. Been using at least a few times a week for a couple months now on the battery that came with the mouse, so I\u2019ve been happy with that. I\u2019d recommend this mouse for sure, especially since it\u2019s often on sale for great prices.",
          "I didnt know it require AAA battery for use. They still produce that old tech? But it has long battery use. I guess its good enough for its price.",
          "I like the size that is compact and its light weight.I also like the versatility of this mouse:You have two options of connectivity - bluetooth and wireless 2.4 ghz with a dongle.Also, you can choose between AA or AAA battery to power this mouse.However, the issue I have with this mouse is Bluetooth connectivity isn't the best. It would struggle to auto pair with both Mac and Windows machine and I find myself manually going through settings in order to reconnect the mouse.",
          "This is a great mouse. It's comfortable for long periods of use even though it is a little smaller.It is extremely lightweight even with the battery installed, this may be a con for some people.Note that even though it is tempting to use bluetooth mode to avoid plugging the receiver in a USB port, the response time of the 2.4ghz wireless signal is much better and almost mandatory for gaming. This will reduce the battery life but you are still looking at hundreds of hours.Only a single AA or single AAA battery is required so it's easy to keep extra supplies on hand.Also note that the click sound of this mouse is quite loud, so if you're looking to use it around someone else, make sure they won't have an issue with it.",
          "So I have big hands and what any big hand gamer understands is that you either have to get a big ol heavy G502 size mouse or use a certain grip to hold all these mice for smaller handed people. I previously owned a Model O, G pro, and Model O wireless.Having big hands my biggest peeve with all the other mice is that they\u2019re ambidextrous mice so they are even harder to hold with fingertip/claw grips because the smooth, near flat, symmetrical sides. I only really make contact with the sides by pinching my fingers with them. I never make contact with the butt or base of the mouse with my grip. There\u2019s where the Orochi changes thingsThe Orochi somehow is a smaller mouse than all of the above but fills out my hand and grip SO much better. The sides actually have slight grooves so I don\u2019t slip off the sides of my mouse and the shorter but bigger hump in the middle makes me for once actually feel the mouse in my palm if I want. Overall the feel is amazing.Battery life varies of course but I can barely tell there\u2019s a battery in the thing even when flicking and the weight and balance of it feel so good.Mobile gaming is the main reason I got this mouse. I like that the dongle stores inside the mouse, uses batteries so I don\u2019t have to worry about keeping it charged or bringing around extra cables to charge it, and the Bluetooth is good for casual gaming but doesn\u2019t do great with big flicks so the 2.4ghz connection is required for esports games.Overall a great mouse and really awesome to game with and a little plus to it is that the shell comes off the back so satisfying, it\u2019s hard to not fidget with it by taking it on and off haha. Well worth the money and I\u2019d expect they\u2019ll make a rechargeable one with all the success this mouse has accrued so far so if the swappable batteries don\u2019t tickle your pickle, I\u2019d just buy a sub $20 rechargeable battery station or just wait for a new rechargeable Orochi to come out.",
          "For me anyway mice fall into two categories. Huge and normal. I would put this one in the normal category. At first it was acting weird on bluetooth. If you must use bluetooth I'd pass on this one. I switched to 2.4ghz receiver and it's been flawless since. I like the size. I have average hands I'm 5'9\" if it matters. I've had a few other Razer mice I didn't care for. This one is my favorite so far. I don't game much with it. So keep that in mind.",
          "Great mouse. I use it every day. It slides smoothly, mouse positioning is very accurate. Feels nice in the hand. Back surface gives good grip to the palm.It has two modes: 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth. Both are working well.. Of course 2.4 GHz is superior but it's convenient I can use the mouse on both PCs. I configure 2.4GHz on one PC, and Bluetooth on another one.Let's talk about what I don't like. Disclaimer: they are extremely minor.I am not a fan of side buttons; I have a tendency to accidentally click on them.It was advertised as a lightweight mouse, but it is actually slightly heavier than my previous wired mouse. I guess wireless technologies are not there yet.I don't like the sound of the click. I like softer sounds.Again, those issues are minor.",
          "TLDR: I was surprised by how much I would like this mouse.  I have 17cm hands, and this mouse fits like a glove, its great, go get it.  Its not perfect, Razer cheaped out and went with a prior gen sensor, and DPI scaling is only in hundreds.  Middle click is a bit too heavy, but I love the tactile scroll wheel.The shape of this mouse is perfect for small to lower end medium hands, I can claw, finger, and palm without any discomfort.  It looks kinda like an egg shape from the top, but it has a really deep ergonomic comfort indent under the side buttons giving you a really secure grip, I feel confident with it, granted I felt confident with my Model O-, but this shape and size suits me much more.  The mouse is also balanced when it comes to wobble, as in there is no wobble.  Every mouse i've used prior to this, even if minimal, has had some wobble.The button clicks are crispier, and more deliberate than the standard Omron switches on most other mice.  I think its just preference, but I like it a bit heavier like this.  Its not night and day heavy and you probably wouldn't even notice unless comparing, but it is.  Side buttons are always mediocre, but these side buttons don't feel like an afterthought, they are clicky and fast.  Scroll wheel is on the heavier tactile side, which is my preference, feels money.  Mouse click is a bit heavy, wouldn't use it for anything you need speed for.It is heavier than other mice i've used, but not by much.  I use this mouse in its AA configuration with the included battery because it feels better balanced than the AAA slot.  A AAA battery makes this mouse feel back heavy and less wieldy than with the AA battery, which feels 'lighter' because the weight is more consistent.  You could get a converter but I think the 75g total weight to feel fine, it doesn't detract from my aim or comfort.The mouse skates are amazingly smooth and thick, they feel better than the tiger arc 2's I have on another mouse.  They have this kind of incandescent shimmer to them on the bottom and look unique, but damn do they feel good.  It is unfortunate when they wear out I wont be able to buy official orochi v2 skates, because for some reason Razer believes you should buy a new mouse.  Corepads and Tiger are good companies, they make good products, but these just feel so good, its such a damn shame.  I play on a glass mousepad, so these feet will eventually wear out, even if it'll take a bit.The sensor is, well its a modern sensor with zero noticeable issues.  That said due to sensor position the DPI in settings is not accurate.  If you game at 400 dpi you're going to have to get used to the additional speed unless you want the potential pixel skipping and slower Y axis at 300 dpi.  I got used to it, but it would of been better if we could adjust DPI at least by 50, if not by 1.  If you use 1600 DPI, you can just lower it to 1500 without any issue since anything over 800 is already pretty damn smooth.  I would of given it a demerit for this since a good configuration software can fix anything, but it didn't affect me at the end of the day.  If you are OCD about it, this mouse will drive you crazy.  If they release an Orochi V3 I hope they use their better sensor, battery life is not as important.  Mouse lift off is a bit higher than 1mm even if you adjust it to that in settings.It is a modern wireless mouse, as all modern wireless mice it has zero problems with latency or skipping.  Some people have had issues though, which appear to be fixed with a beta firmware update that you can get on Reddit.  I cant fault the mouse since the problem never happened to me, but YMMV.Before getting this mouse I swore I would never get a razer product again, the feet for my Razer Naga Trinity has worn out and I was unable to get replacements since no one made them, and razer did not sell them from their store.  Unfortunately, they seem to be continuing this trend, but the big players will make their own feet for it so they've got you covered.",
          "This mouse is absolutely amazing. It has a super smooth glide without being too slippery it feels perfect to the touch. This is absolutely one of the best computer mice I've used in a long time. I've accidentally left the battery on all night and the mouse still hasn't drained it. The mouse is very responsive. Hands down one of the best out there that I can recommend. If that isn't enough for you, you can put a double or a triple A battery in it. it's a nice feature that is worth the purchase alone. Can't recommend enough.",
          "I wanted a lightweight wireless gaming mouse but I couldn't justify spending like $150 on a top tier one, so I bought the Razer Orochi instead. I've been using it for 2 months and it seems good so far, but I'll update the review if it has any issues. I was hesitant buying another Razer mouse because I had their Viper Mini and it had issues after about 2 months. I'm half expecting this to just die on me lol, but so far it's been responsive. I use it to play Valorant and it does its job. I was used to light mice so when I went for cheaper wireless mice, I couldn't get used to how heavy they were.I also have small hands so the Orochi fits it nicely. I'm always afraid of mice being too bit/clunky for me to use but this one is perfect for me. I use a lithium AAA battery to make it lighter and have to end up changing the battery every month (had it for 2 months, changed the battery twice so far). Sometimes I just forget to turn it off so that's on me lol. Honestly, I feel like I'll end up spending more in the long run buying batteries for it instead of getting a super good rechargeable mouse, but I do like the way it fits in my tiny hand so I guess that's the tradeoff I have to make",
          "Great product for the first year one of the best mice I have used with even better battery life, but after a year my right click has begun double clicking or not registering any input, causing me to stop aiming in first person shooters. This could have been just my unit so I don\u2019t want to deter anyone from trying this product, but this was my experience with it",
          "Literally cannot get over how much I love this mouse. Glad I went with this over the Logitech G Pro.",
          "I was looking for a mouse to replace a small optical mouse I used for gaming for last 10 years. The Razer Orichi V2 was the exact same length, width and height with a slightly better shape so I ordered it.This mouse has great build quality, and perfect for my fingertip grip and medium size hands.It is a optical mouse.2.4 GHz USB wireless or BluetoothOrichi V2 is battery powered. Can choose a single AA or AAA for operation, not both.The mouse is super light, even with the AA battery.Razer includes a AA Energizer lithium battery (no cheap crap).The mouse arrives with the USB dongle in its holder under the top cover the houses the battery.The coating has a slight texture to it so it\u2019s not super smooth and slick.No RGB lighting, which is fine for me. I end up turning the RGB off on most things as I play as it\u2019s distracting.All buttons are easy to reach and feel crisp when depressed.You will have to register on Razer site for warranty and to access to customize the mouse by downloading Razer Synapse 3, but the mouse worked out of the box with 2.4Hz dongle in USB 3.2 on a brand new tower build wit fresh OS installed (Windows 10 64).With the Razer Synapse 3 from their site the mouse is fully customizable.You can choose 5 pre assigned dpi levels  or turn it off and manually adjust the dpi all the way to 18000 dpi.The tracking is great, it\u2019s 1000 Hz poll rate, there are two optical setting 2mm and 1mm. 2mm is defaultYou can assign the buttons through the Synapse 3 downloaded from the site also.Overall very impressed with the mouse so far. If your a fingertip grip or claw grip user I highly recommend it. Think old school egg shape mouse but with new Gaming tech.Lightweight, textured coating, High DPI, High Polling, great optical sensor, customizable.",
          "I've bought this mouse due to my right hand is feeling numb from using Logitech G502. I've used the G502 for over 4 years and the weight doesn't really bother me in game, but lately it's been hurting my right hand so I wanted something more light. First I ordered Logitech G305, it was on sale for $30, after countless reviews on Youtube and Google I cancelled the G305 and ordered the  Orochi V2 instead.All of the reviews will tell you the Orochi V2 is a superior product in everyway. The only problem was the Orochi V2 was $70 and G305 was $50 (but occasionally on sale for lower). Now that price drop because of the holidays the Orochi V2 is the BEST option for a budget wireless mouse period. It compete with a lot of the higher end mouse on the market that ranges b/w $100-$150.My hand size is in b/w medium and large and the Orochi V2 fit it perfectly. I was a little worry that it might be too small for my hand after looking at several reviews but this wasn't the case. The back of mouse sit perfectly on my palm and my fingers are perfectly place on the tip of the mouse. When I place my hand on the mouse it felt like it was perfectly cater to my hand in a natural shape. For example, if you was to relax your hand and just let it naturally curl then place that hand the Orochi V2 it would fit perfectly without needing to adjust or move any fingers (at least for me). I used a AAA Lithium battery and place it on the AA slot for better balance and lighter weight. Coming from the G502 (121 gram) to the Orochi V2 (65 gram) there's no resistance at all when moving left and right and it felt natural compare to the heavier mouse.This is my first wireless gaming mouse and I don't usually care about the technical stuff but something about this click on the mouse feel very satisfying even the side buttons. All around feel great... I only wish they have infinite scroll/hyper scroll like the G502. When I first bought the G502 I hated the scroll wheels but I've learned to love it so much especially browsing the web or reading an online novel. The scroll wheel on the Orochi V2 is also good but I just prefer the infinite/hyper scroll since I'm so used to it.Anyways, I've used it only for a few days and right hand feels a lot better. The numb/pain is going away after using the Orochi V2, I think it'll take a week or two before it's fully back to normal.I'm using a USB 3.1 on the mouse so far no problem with skipping but there is a firmware update that suppose to fix skipping issues if you're currently experiencing that. The firmware can only be updated using a Bluetooth connection so beware. In conclusion this mouse is worth $45 and even more with the build quality and comfort it provide. After experiencing what 65g of weight feels like I don't think I can go back to a heaver mouse or wired.",
          "My main mouse is the Logitech G305 which I always use with NIMH Duracell rechargeable batteries (2500ma), and the reviews speak highly of the Orochi, so I bought one.My configuration of use is dpi 3200 and poling rate of 1000.Between both mice I have experienced that the razor constantly indicates that its battery is low, although it is not true, it must be something related to its internal voltage meter, it is worth mentioning that this does not happen to me with the G305.Ignoring the warnings from the razer, using it 4 hours a day, the battery lasts 5 days until the pointer begins to give tracking problems due to low power, with the same setting on the G305 it lasts 16 days using it 4 hours a day day. It should be noted that the logitech has better compatibility with NiMH batteries.Ergonomically the mouse is too small for my hand, I like the G305 a little better, I just wish it was a little taller.For those who play on gaming laptops, do not place the usb receiver near the exhaust vents, because if it overheats, the mouse will stop working.The software is not completely polished, it fails a lot when changing profiles between programs, the same happens with Corsair solutions and with Lg GHub. But the advantage of Logitech is that they have the OnBoard memory program that I program the profile directly on the mouse without having to that require the program.I hope this review is useful to someone and thanks for the attention.",
          "This mouse is a great alternative to the Logitech G305. They are very similar mice, and you can't really go wrong with either, in terms of ergonomics, software, and pricepoint. I find this mouse smaller yet more ergonomic than the G305, and works very well with my particular grip style, which is a mix of fingertip & palm grip. I like the option for removable custom top plates, which is also great for cleaning. I dunno, order both this and the G305 and return the one you don't like",
          "Sometimes when I click this mouse, it clicks multiple times. I had my partner try it and they don't have that happen. I touch things very lightly and that includes clicking on a mouse and typing (so I need super lightweight keyboards as well or it's hard to press down the keys).If you also touch things very lightly, you may end up having this issue happen. I sometimes play games like overwatch and if I'm healing as Mercy, my little beam will switch on and off rapidly if I start loosening up on how hard I'm pressing. That's not so much of an issue since it's just a game, but what IS an issue is when I'm trying to click areas of the screen with sensitive checkboxes like a doctors office intake form or paying bills on archaic systems that charge multiple times with multiple clicks. I'll be contacting Razer to get a replacement and will update my review if that fixes my issue.",
          "I am on my computer often (hours a day for work and play).  I gamed for decades and always had the best mice.  But, the last year few years I haven't gamed much and had been using something not so great.  I play a game here or there again and decided I wanted something great again.  I want a mouse that will last many years (something that you have to put batteries into / not rechargeable), that is fairly small and light (which I've always preferred), has no fancy lights, long battery life, responsive & accurate, and good quality / feel.This clicks all the boxes!  It allows you to use a AA or a AAA; only one at a time, do not insert both.  The AAA option is for the lightest weight.  I admit I haven't used that option.  I want the longevity of the AA over the AAA (usually rechargeable AAA's are under 1000mah, and AA's are over 2000mah - so you get 2 to 3 times more battery life with the AA).  I use rechargeable batteries in everything; however, the first battery I used in this mouse is an Energizer lithium.  I want to see how long it lasts with a normal high quality battery (so far, 30 days with ~7  hours of computer use a day.  I never turn the mouse off, it is always switched to 2.4 and turned on when I am away from computer).  With the AA the feel and balance is great.  One of best feeling mice I have used.  Has plenty of buttons for my uses.  Extreme gamers may want more.  I barely use the few extra it has.  The buttons all feel good and sturdy.  They should last, I hope.  It looks classy, I have the white color.I like that is has both bluetooth and 2.4 modes.  The 2.4 mode will give you the best performance.  However, it will also cut the battery life!  The bluetooth mode will give you a ton more battery life; however, you will lack some performance.  I have not tested bluetooth mode at all yet, I wanted to test the mouse fully with this first battery before doing that.  In the future, I may switch between bluetooth mode and 2.4 mode when I switch from normal computing to gaming.  I only game say, 1 out of 7 hours I am on the computer.  So, that is a potential benefit.  I also like it has the bluetooth in case I want to take it anywhere for work computing, with a laptop or tablet.  Then, I can leave the 2.4 usb card in my desktop at home, and still have a great mouse for on the go.  When I bring it home, it's all ready again.Overall I am very happy with it after having it for a month now and using it daily.  I hope it lasts for years.*Update.  My mouse battery finally died for the first time on March 27, 2022.  It was working perfect, then suddenly the cursor stopped moving.  It lasted about 2.5 months with an Energizer Lithium (2.4ghz whole time, mouse never turned off).  Not bad!  I assume a good rechargeable (Eneloop) will give me at least 2 months (and with rechargeable batteries, I will just replace every 2 months (maybe even every month), just so I know my mouse will never stop working when I need it)).",
          "La caja vino rota por una esquina (se puede ver en la imagen), cosa que no me agrada ya que comprar un producto nuevo, con ese tipo de da\u00f1os cosm\u00e9ticos a la caja, me hace dudar de la integridad del producto, al momento el mouse se comportamiento muy bien, es r\u00e1pido, muy ligero, tiene opci\u00f3n de Bluetooth, el sensor usb que trae y adem\u00e1s permite usar bater\u00edas doble A y triple A, lo \u00fanico es que cuando reinicio mi pc o la enciendo, tarda en conectarse (sin importar si lo conecto por Bluetooth o por sensor) y para mi es molesto esperar a que se conecte para empezar a usar mi pc (tengo un logitech que jamas me a dado ese problema),, eso si una vez conectado la conexi\u00f3n es muy estable, no eh tenido problemas en ese sentido, por lo dem\u00e1s un buen producto y aun as\u00ed lo recomiendo (si no te molesta ese peque\u00f1o detalle en la conexi\u00f3n)"

          "1. This mouse is not \"lightweight junk\".2. Braided cables are worse.3. Silicone side grips were never that great.Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. Let me clear some things up.The Kailh switches in here are mid-weight and feel slightly heavier (and less mushy) than the optical switches in the Deathadder V2. The side buttons feel significantly better than the V2.  The scroll wheel is less tactile (or smoother, depending on how you look at it).This is a heavy, heavy boy by today's standards. This thing is better built than the V2, but consequently harder to do a weight reduction mod because the plastic is so damn thick.People that complain about this version not having a braided cable... you want an even less flexible one?! Razer's braided cable is the same rubber cable with an additional outside sheath, making it even less flexible. This cable is an improvement from years past, but it's not great. Fortunately because it's not braided, it's easy to rip the rubber sheath and shielding off, and paracord it.The side grips are meh. It's a bit more than molded plastic, but not as noticeable as the silicone on the V2. Silicone still gets slippery when wet, so best solution was always aftermarket grips. If the V2 had G703 quality rubber grips to being with, then I could see the grip complaints on here being justified.My biggest problem with this thing is the lack of replacement skates. No corepads or tiger ice for this model. It has the rear skate of the V2, but two front skates more similar to the V2 Pro. If you you like the white color or mechanical switches, and use less than 6400dpi, then can't go wrong for $20 and some elbow grease.Software still blows. Can use open source software to permaset light effects when not plugged into PC w/ Synapse.",

I went to the razer forum and a proposed solution was to blow some air to remove dust, if any. I don't have compressed air, so I just blow some air with my mouth, and it fixed the issue. So 4 stars, the mouse is good. I just hope razer would be more cautious with dust infiltration, but after all that's a budget mouse in their catalog... can't ask too much.",
          "I needed a high quality laser mouse. I play FPS games. Not \"professionally\" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better.",

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area.  I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).That brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",

It's a new mouse so it shouldn't have any issues yet, but I looked it up and I guess this is a normal problem for this mouse. I did the settings trick: control panel > mouse > wheel > one page at a time. This helped a little but it still jumps up and down. I would rather not open my mouse up to try to fix it but I think that's where I'm at :/"

          "I picked up this mouse as it was the latest and greatest at the time of this review. Work paid for me to get a desktop setup similar to what I have in the office so I figured I would see what this mouse was all about.There are many that say it is too heavy and will not be comfortable for long sessions at the desk, but I do not find that to be the case at all. I really like the form factor of the mouse and do not notice the weight being an issue at all, even after 8-10 hours of work a day.The lighting is cool, but I have to have the software open in the background. I thought there was some on board memory that would keep my settings, but so far I have not found it, although I have not spent a lot of time looking for it.The scroll wheel has good feedback when scrolling line by line. There is also a button that unlocks the wheel for an infinite scroll function that lets you spin the wheel once and scroll until it stops. This is great for long web pages or spreadsheets with many rows.The size of the mouse is great too. I have an average sized hand I would say and I have no issues gripping the mouse or reaching any of the buttons. I was looking for something with a little bit more symmetry, but the shape is iconic to the brand and has grown on me since I got it out of the box.I have the mouse paired with the new wireless keyboard that Razer has out and am currently waiting for the wireless charging dock to be delivered, but that will allow me to easily charge the mouse at lunch and overnight when I am not using it as well as act as a hub that both the mouse and keyboard can pair to. I know that is not directly related to the mouse, but it is compatable with it so I felt it was worth the mention.At the end of the day this mouse is a lot like  many of the other flagship gaming mice that I have used from many other manufactures, but I really like it and will not be in any hurry to replace it!",
          "Very comfortable to use. My hand fits it like a glove. The customization capabilities are great, both RGB and macro buttons.",
          "Best! Mouse! Ever!Finally found a mouse that is 100% for me. I used every mouse you could think of from Razer. This is absolutely it. No more mouse hunting!",
          "For a long time been gaming with different mouses that either didn't have side buttons or they malfunctioned, or didn't feel comfortable/were too heavy or slow to move around. I greatly advise this one as it is comfortable to hold even for small hands, it moves around easily on surfaces, clicking is not heavy and pretty satisfying, comfortable rest for the thumb and cool side buttons that do not sink in or malfunction.",
          "I am really enjoying this mouse. Is it my favorite mouse? Hard to say, I have different mice for different things. I have a Naga Pro for MOBAs and MMOs, a Deathadder v2 Pro for FPS, and an Orochi for my gaming laptop. I also have a drawer full of other mice that I enjoy using from time to time like the Roccat Burst Pro that was my daily driver for nearly a year.So where does this mouse fit in? To me, this is the best all-rounder. The hyperscroll is great for getting through long webpages or spreadsheets. Combined with its comfortable ergonomic shape, and low noise and pleasant feel, it is excellent as an office mouse.However, it is great for FPS games as well. The main buttons feel nice to click. The side buttons are easy to find and press. And I have even found myself using the clutch every now and then when sniping. And I have come to appreciate the thumb rest. No more accidently dragging the edge of my thumb on the mousepad.The features do add some extra weight, however. This in turn makes it slightly less desirable than my Deathadder for shooters. But really not by much. I only notice the weight difference if I am quickly switching between them. In use though, I do just as well with the Basilisk as I do with the Deathadder. Both are comfy for long game sessions. with excellent ergonomics and good buttons. I do enjoy the scroll wheel on the Basilisk more than the Deathadder.I could probably press the Basilisk into service for a MOBA. However, I have grown accustomed to the Naga's six button side panel. Since I have the option, I would probably be included to use that LoL or HotS (not that I play either much anymore).For MMOs there is nothing that can replace my Naga with the 12 button side panel. The Basilisk just cannot compete, and that's ok. MMO mice a very specialized thing. If you are at the point where you need 24+ keybinds on your mouse, you probably already have this covered.But, if you need just one mouse in your life, I think the Basilisk is an excellent choice. Even if you are shopping office mice, give this one a look. The Smart-Reel Hyperscroll is a thing of beauty for the office once you get used to it. And when you are gaming, the sensitivity clutch can be really handy.Also, the lighting looks pretty cool and it's easy to work with. Aesthetics are important too :D",
          "My 11 year old has this for gaming, it fits his hand well, the click speed is quick and there has not been any glitches.",
          "You can change the 3rd side button",
          "I've had many mice lolFrom the cheap E-Waste to the more premium gaming mice...For obvious reasons, the cheap e-waste mice were just that, cheap, of course they didn't have any weight...Some other mice I've had, were weighted or had adjustable weights...This mouse from Razer is right smack dab in the middle when it comes to weight, Not as heavy as say the TT Esports Black Element ($70 at the time) which I feel was probably the heaviest mouse I ever used, but the weight was adjustable... This Razer mouse certainly is not as light as the common e-waste...But, the mouse has a lot of good functionality, the mouse wheel is adjustable, you can set the clicker on the mouse wheel roll or disengage it so the mouse wheel spins freely, all at the push of a button on the mouse, has all the other buttons commonly found on gaming mice in good natural feeling locations and I like the thumb rest, helps keep me from blocking my mouse movements when playing FPS games...The clicks are loud and noticeable, you can feel them, the clicks are fairly crisp.The sensitivity is easily adjustable via presets or manuallyThe RGB, i'm not really big into, but i do enjoy the esthetic, it is fully customizable.I gotta say, the engineer for this mouse put some thought into it... It's not perfect but its good...On a scale of 1 thru 10, one being crap and 10 being perfect... This mouse for me, easily places at a strong 8, leaning hard on nine... This reason, the GUI for the RGB interface is not that user friendly... The clicker to let the mouse wheel free spin or stay in place is butted up to the mouse wheel and easy to click on accident while in game play... The mouse weight don't feel right to me but thats not the engineers fault, its my own for playing with weighted mice... And being that I am not a fan of wireless mice and keyboards, I do feel the cable on this mouse is a tad short, but easily fixable with an extension... I do enjoy my cable management on wired peripherals :)I imagine for most, this mouse will be a 5 star mouse... I'm just nit-picky :)",
          "I'm coming from a G502 hero. I love that mouse, but it started to make my wrist hurt. The Baskilisk is a bit lighter but still gives a nice heavy feel. It glides smoothly, and the button layout is good (with the hero I'd have the issue misclicking the dpi button) my hands aren't the biggest but I feel far more comfortable with this than the G502 hero. Button clicks feel solid (had it for 2 months now, no problems), Overall a good mouse, and the RGB, if you're into it, is top-notch.My only real con is the right and left mouse buttons, not the biggest fan of the hard plastic they used, but I honestly don't notice them when gaming or deep browsing.",
          "So much better than the V1 and I lived that mouse. Great for drafting.",
          "So my first experience with this mouse wasn't the greatest. The Bluetooth function and the 2.4Ghz dongle didn't work with connecting the mouse to my computer so I had to get a replacement. The replacement works perfectly though so no complaints there and really glad Amazon was so quick to send a replacement for me! Since getting the replacement, I have loved using this mouse for productivity and work. The ergo shape feels great and having the 4 way scroll wheel is a game changer for work. I gave this 4 stars though because of a few things. First being the price. $160 is a lot to charge for a mouse, but I do realize that other mice in this category are around the same price, but I still don't see why. Second is the fact that Razer made an extra wireless puck to go in the bottom of this mouse, but they sell it separately along with the wireless dock. I understand selling the dock separately, but not the wireless puck; why not just include the puck in this package instead? Otherwise, I really enjoy using this mouse, but not sure I would recommend it for gaming unless you like a heavier mouse.",
          "I've been using an anodised aluminium mouse mat for a couple of years with G502, but the thing has always been making a lot of noise (the same sort of noise as you would get from sliding G502 down on finely polished wooden surface). These teflon feet actually make the thing slide silently.The mouse comes bundled with Razer's new super-ultra-extra-speed-flex cable. The cable is not just a marketing nonsense, it indeed has barely noticeable drag.The build quality is spotless. Even the mouse wheel that generally makes Razer products look low-quality has fairly nice feel.About the Synapse software. Right after installation I discovered a bug with using on-the-flight DPI feature (i. e. you hold a button and use the scroll wheel to adjust the DPI). When coupled with free spinning wheel, the the DPI keeps increasing even after the wheel has stopped. The bug has been reported, but the very fact that I encountered a bug almost immediately after installation is concerning. Apparently, the rumors about Razer Synapse are also true. Which is bad. Very bad, if that is their attitude.",
          "On the mouse tail edge, there have some lights leaked between the gap of plastic. And they should improve the RGB light on the mouse tail, it is little annoying when I watched it.",
          "In all honesty, this is the best feeling mouse I've tried... and I've tried. Searched for ergo mice, tried the g502, nothing feels quite as good in my hand. If you don't want all the fancy lighting there are cheaper options... but they're all variations of the basilisk. And my only gripe with the v3 is the wire. But if you've got the cash, the v3 pro is the perfect mouse. (Which I full intend to upgrade to)",
          "I was a long time use of Logitech with the G502 or MX Master. I had several issues with them like left button double clicking automatically and so was upset by it. If I used Logitech it was mainly for the infinite scroll.I discovered that this mouse also support infinite scroll and has overall the same features as the G502. On top it works with bluetooth removing the need from using the dongle if you don't want to.So I got this one and it works well, at least with bluetooth. I had issue with the dongle but as bluetooth work well I am fine with it.",
          "It's almost $200 and I still find some flaws with it. Battery life is extremely poor and despite the high price, I don't know why it doesn't come with a wireless charging port. Yes, you can connect an USB-C cable to it but really? You can't thow in a wireless charger for the price? It does come with USB C cable though...but it's very cumbersome to use.",
          "This mouse is comfortable I used to use the razer viper mini and this is a BIG upgrade",
          "\u00a0Razer did a great job with rgb leds. Mouse itself is a heavy and little-bit bigger mouse, ergonomic grip. Cable quality is awesome. 26K sensor works flawlessly. Bought used in very good condition and I recommend it! Great alternative to Logitech G502.",
          "My son absolutely love this for gaming.",
          "Edit: Use a solid SteelSeries mouse mat, after a month of use the stakes got scratched enough it'd sound like it was dragging around, and not moving smoothly. Never had that issue with this mat before. Some very light sanding with a damp scotch brite pad made it smooth again.Edit: Synapse started working properly more or less. It wasn't staying on after pc went to sleep.Other than that, this has been a great mouse for the month I've been using it thus far. Had a G500s which only lasted 6 years before the left click microswitch stopped working. Hopefully this one will last a lot longer.Wonderful feel in the hand. The scroll wheel isn't slippery like some mice are. You can unlock the scroll wheel if you want it to spin fast freely. Nearly the same feel in the hand as the G500s.I believe 1600 is the DPI by default which for me is fine with maximum settings in windows as well. You can easily turn it up in Synapse, provided the program is on.I'd give this mouse 5 stars if Synapse didn't loose sync or turn off every time I put my pc to sleep and wake up. And yes. Auto-Launch is checked on, and it doesn't launch on wake up.",
          "I want to preface this by saying that I came from a Logitech G903, and a Logitech G500 (OG) before that. The G500 was my first real \"gaming\" mouse and I loved that thing. I had zero issues with it ergonomically and I've gotten pretty comfortable with it playing FPS games. I'm not going to pretend I'm an esports pro or some hotshot, but I think I was above average rank rise. That was back then in middle/high school. Now I just play casually and use my computer for CAD and sometimes play valorant and warzone (casually) with friends.The main reason why I had to get a new mouse in the first place was that the left click on the G500 started double-clicking and even sometimes did not register a click at all. I figured it lasted me long enough maybe I should look into the newer version or successor for it. This was the G502. There are a lot of great things about the G502, and from what I can tell this mouse benchmarked that mouse. I went to a local BestBuy to try out some mice for myself, I was not really totally in love with the left and right clicks. They happened to have a G903 right next to it, and the clicks felt way better, way more positive feeling (and sounding). The G903 became my primary mouse for work/play on my desktop as well as my laptop, being wireless and all. However, maybe after a couple of months, I started having some problems with the scroll wheel. Essentially, the scroll wheel would register two scroll clicks with one scroll click, sometimes not even a click. It was honestly really annoying, I'm not sure how I dealt with that for the last two years. Eventually, I had enough and decided to get another mouse. This time I looked at what Razer had to offer. I watched some videos comparing the G502 to the Basilisk and decided to go with the Basilisk over Logitech since no real improvement has been made since the G502 has come out.Now onto the review of the mouse. It's fantastic, and everything I was looking for. The scroll wheel is light years better than anything Logitech has. The left and right buttons are, I believe optical switches, pretty nice. The materials seem to be textured plastic, similar to those of PBT keycaps. The lighting isn't really important to me since I leave it on one color anyway, but the underglow (diffused) light strip is a nice touch. The software is not as intuitive as I'd like, but it gets the job done. I don't play competitive FPS anymore, so I can't talk much about its accuracy or performance but it definitely didn't hinder my play at all. It is way more comfortable than the G903 (obviously), and I feel as if I can hold it all day using a claw grip. The wire doesn't get intrusive, and this is coming from someone who used a wireless mouse primarily before! All in all, this mouse really fit, and exceeded, my needs.",
          "I love this mouse! I have a claw grip typically, but interestingly enough with this mouse I use a full palm grip. It's very comfortable even with long gaming sessions and combined with the razer Goliath pad it GLIDES. I did get one that was DOA, and even though the manual says to contact Razer for support NOT Amazon or the seller, after a lot of back and forth I happily went through Amazon for a replacement instead. The second one came in and worked perfectly so I won't dock a star, it happens.",
          "Bright, lightweight, super customizable. What else do you need?",
          "Got this as a Christmas present and had several damn it! Moments it is a awesome mouse the response is on point. finally QI charging a real plus and the battery at times did not charge it for almost a month and that is constantly using it. Great mouse a little pricey but it is worth it.",
          "I used to use a wireless mouse with an optional/charging cord, but the slight lag was obnoxious and I ended up always leaving it plugged in. The cable was bulky and awkward and always a pain, and I could feel it when I would move the mouse certain ways. The cable for this mouse feels revolutionary! I legitimately don't notice it at all when playing FPS, it feels so smooth. It's overall a slightly lighter/smaller mouse than what I'm used to but I think the adjustment will be for the best in the end.A part of me does wish the cable could be unplugged from the mouse just for storage/cable management ease (I use a vertical mouse when not gaming) but it isn't really much of an issue. Great mouse really recommend.",
          "Pros:1 Heavy for those who are able to use precision muscle movement or have large desks for long movement in FPS and other games that involve constant movement like aiming a large turret or a game that requires lots of movement to complete a task.2 Precise when needed thanks to a DPI 'Sniper' Mode that can be defined as a super low DPI that results in precision pointing.3 Ease of Use - Razer software automatically recognized the device, configured it to default settings and launched Razer Synapse to configure the device with tool tips and ease of use to the user.4 Easy to Configure - Razer Synapse showed me all the functions and features within seconds.5 RGB is easy on the eyes, not to bright or overpowering to peripheral vision.6 Touch Button Mouse Wheel interlock, i love this feature.  just touch the button mouse wheel is free to spin or has slight friction via ridges in the mouse wheel surface.CONS:1 if you are a 'fat finger' gamer with larger than normal hands or finger thickness,  this mouse might catch you on a couple things:A: Mouse wheel click is EASILY triggered by left or right finger hitting up against it in a fast pace high rigid moments of FPS or high intensity gaming moments.2 The Thumb rest is a bit over engineered, pro-longed sessions of the user might result in soreness of the side of the thumb from sitting on the resting spot, it has no padding of any kind to mitigate this.  just a thin textured rubber surface.3 DPI this is the first mouse I've used that does not allow dynamic Up and/or Down on the fly adjustment, it is just sequential 1,2,3,4 and 5.  you cannot go up 2,  then down 1.  you have to cycle through the entire set of DPI settings you as the user configure and there is no indication of which DPI you are currently using via RGB or some kind of status indicator.  every mouse i had prior to this does this.  Razer is the first that does not.Overall, i am a happy gamer with the Basilisk 3.",
          "The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-performance gaming mouse that is designed for gamers who demand precision and accuracy. It features a 20,000 DPI optical sensor, 11 programmable buttons, and customizable RGB lighting.One of the standout features of the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is its precision scroll wheel. The scroll wheel allows for adjustable resistance, allowing you to tailor the scrolling experience to your preferences. This can be especially useful for games that require precise scrolling, such as first-person shooters.The mouse is also designed for comfort, with an ergonomic design that reduces hand fatigue during extended gaming sessions. The 11 programmable buttons allow for quick and easy access to frequently used functions, which can give you an edge in fast-paced games.The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is compatible with the Razer Synapse software, which allows you to customize the mouse's performance, lighting, and macros. This software is easy to use and provides a wide range of customization options, so you can get the most out of your mouse.It is important to note that the high performance and customization options come with a higher price point, which may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, some users may prefer alternative gaming mouse options.In conclusion, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-performance gaming mouse that is designed for gamers who demand precision and accuracy. Its precision scroll wheel, customizable buttons, and RGB lighting make it a solid choice for gamers who want a mouse that is tailored to their specific needs.",
          "This product would\u2019ve been perfect if it weren\u2019t for the fact that theres a slight delay when it comes to this mouse. There isn\u2019t an instant delay but the delay does appear randomly. overall 9/10",
          "Really 4-1/2 stars. The Razor Basilisk V3 is nearly perfect hardware. The shortcomings are in the software and firmwear.ProBuilt solid and not a rattle trap like my old logitech.Scroll wheel in clicky mode is the perfect resistance.All the switches have excellent feel and response.Being optical switches I don't expect issues with switch chatterBig enough for my big hands.The scroll wheel acceleration is cool if a bit gimmickyConsLighting profiles can't be stored in the onboard profiles.The lighting is a rotating color without the software. I use a KVM and wish I could just set the mouse to solid color for the systems that don't have synapse installed.The synapse software sometimes fails to detect a game is running and doesn't switch profiles.ConclusionI'm replacing a Logitech G502 and that mouse served me wall but I never liked it's scroll setup. It needed frequent cleaning and the Logitech isn't exactly easy to get into. for the necessary cleaning. (Cat hair). The logitech died of worn out switches. Something that I doubt will be a problem with optical switches. The Basilisk feels more solid than the Logitech despite being lighter. It just feels like quality.",
          "I went online to see what mouses are the best. The Razer Basilisk was at the top of the list on many websites.Feels comfortable in all facets. The wheel can be switched between tactile or free-spin. I prefer tactile, but it's nice to have the option. The mouse response is amazing. You can adjust the movement from 1-26000 which is amazing. I have mine set to 8000. These numbers represent how fast the mouse icon moves relative to your hand movement. Higher means your hand moves less. The buttons feel comfortable and work great. There is button customization for gaming which I don't utilize.I definitely recommend this mouse for anyone that games. However, if you just use a computer for basic functions like email, internet surfing, etc. it's probably too high of a price point.",
          "There are some pretty significant changes from the V2. Some of them are upgrades, but some of them are downgrades.The sensitivity clutch is now integrated into the mouse as a non-removable button that feels incredibly stiff and has a lot more resistance. I definitely view this as a downgrade and would've preferred the V2 clutch, mainly because it was removable and its click resistance was comparable to the scroll wheel click.Mouse sensitivity swapping is now relegated to a single button that toggles between all of the sensitivity stages. The V2 had two buttons: one for increasing and one for decreasing the sensitivity stage.The scroll wheel has probably changed the most. For starters, it's not as easy to accidentally press the dreaded left and right scroll wheel clicks as the V2, which is perfect for me since my hand isn't perfectly parallel to my mouse.Razer also removed the scroll wheel resistance slider and opted for a button to toggle between \"free spin\" (infinite scroll) and \"tactile\" (normal scroll) modes. This button is conveniently located right behind the scroll wheel, which used to be the button to increase the sensitivity stage of the mouse. Unfortunately, it's also no longer possible to fully customize the scroll wheel resistance, unlike the V2 which had a scroll wheel on the bottom of the mouse.In Razer Synapse, there are also options like \"Smart Reel\", which toggles free spin when you flick the scroll wheel and then switches back to tactile when there's no movement. Personally, I left this setting disabled because it seems a bit sensitive to how fast you move the scroll wheel, not necessarily if you flick it.The extra RGB lightbar on the bottom of the mouse is really cool and produces a halo effect on the bottom of the mouse. However, Razer's software is still garbage when it comes to customizing the RGB.Overall, the most noticeable changes boil down to the scroll wheel and the sensitivity clutch. Compared to the V2, the V3 has infinite scrolling, which is nice for long webpages or documents, but you lose the ability to customize the scroll resistance altogether. If you need/want a sensitivity clutch for gaming (like to slow down your aim while sniping), you will definitely want to stick with the V2. I cannot recommend the V3 to anyone who uses the sensitivity clutch.With that said, I would recommend this more than the Logitech G502 Hero mainly because the Basilisk V3 uses optical switches, which don't suffer from double-clicking, and it has the same infinite scrolling feature.",
          "Not as many buttons as I thought (switches profiles). Otherwise, does well. Not as sound clicking noises as my Logitech G502, but manages with the digital tactile scroll wheel. Great for a mouse with a light fee",
          "Great customizable mouse. Works perfectly",
          "Wow this is a stunning mouse. I always liked heavy gaming mice more than light ones but this has swayed my opinion. Not only that but it has a very nice clean look that adds a quality look to any desk. Mouse clicks have depth rather than a sharp pointy click, which I have come to prefer. Mouse buttons 4 and 5 are positioned in a very easy to reach place along with the dpi drop switch. Scroll wheel has a nice light tactile feel to it. The biggest boon however is the mouse scroll switch button which feels very nice to use> You can hear the brakes the scroll wheel has engage and disengage.",
          "This Mouse is worth the money, the button placement and Ability to change sensitivity helps for precision aiming in FPS. There is so much customization to it as well, though it sometimes doesn't change colors and I have to open the app manually.",
          "This mouse is amazing for playing PUBG. The customizable buttons and the scroll wheel being able to be pushed to the right or left has made playing PUBG amazingly well. I programed the buttons in the Razer synapse app to be for 1 and 2 and it's made it easier to switch guns in a fight or anything else. This is the mouse to go for PUBG. Along with the huntsman V2 keyboard you'll be set.",
          "I'm a frequent Razer consumer, who got used to have yes or yes, a razer peripheral (keyboard & mouse). this is my third mouse since I got into PC gaming, and I found the \"basilisk\" mouse model the most pleasing and complete for gaming due to the extra buttons it carries specially the clutch button (8 including the mouse wheel) and thumb side skirt that prevents my thumb to drag against the mouse pad.In the second photo behind the new Basilisk V3 is my previous mouse Basilisk V2 that I purchased back in November 2020, (had to modify the clutch pedal to engage the button with minimal travel \"personal preference\") still works. nothing of the buttons isn't giving up due to the abuse of daily gaming and my acidic hands... the reason of the replacement was: browsing in amazon saw the V3 for 50$ and I said: Bruh why not.Pretty much feels the same material (exterior) and skates from the previous version, in my opinion it's a POS. now what has changed from the previous is, that the V2 have a customizable wheel tension that got me used to a certain extra tension. but that feature got replaced with the \"Hyper scroll\" that I'm already finding conveniences of engaging the tension for gaming and releasing it \"hyper scroll engaged\" when scrolling over websites/long PDF documents. This function is mechanical, and you can feel/hear how it engages/releases the mechanism by a noticeable click in the wheel. plus, more RGB in the lower sides that makes it look nicer.This feels it's a mouse that will last based on the similarity of the previous V2 (not esthetically but functionality speaking if you just drag it and don't smash it when you get killed by a scav over 200m in tarkov)Happy little games and scrolls.",
          "I have been gaming for around my whole life actually, but for some reason I cannot figure out this one button on the mouse not the 2 slim ones are not a problem but it's the one thick one right where you're some would go. I play rainbow six siege and I wanted to put the button as a control but when I did it it wasn't seeing the button. You know it wasn't responding so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to enable this button somehow or it's just not working.",
          "My last mouse was the Razer Taipan White from 2014, which still works great but feels like a change. I bought this Basilisk V3 during the 2022 Thanksgiving to replace it, definitely feels like a significant upgrade all around. Shoutout to Razer for the excellent quality product! I'll pick the Razer mouse over any other.",
          "I upgraded from the Basilisk V3 to the Pro and the difference is amazing. Love the feel of it and the battery life has improved significantly. Best of all is the wireless charging this mouse offers. Paired it with the wireless charging dock and it is perfect. No more having to line up the charging prongs on the V3 dock.",
          "This is hard for me to not give this mouse a full five stars, because it is very nearly perfect. I love the wire, never gets in the way it is so soft and I don\u2019t have to track batteries ever. I moved over from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 lognitrec because of the mouse button issues and me deleting files. This razed is amazing, the infinit scroll is awesome I don\u2019t know why it took so long to do this and why it isn\u2019t a standard option. The mouse glides so smoothly because I am a twitch mouse user ever since the first optical mice. I even bought the new firefly mouse pad for this and the pair are freaking magic, it is so smooth, I feel even a single spec of dust. Hence my finger nails stay clipped because your little fingernail if long will graze on the pad or table, leave tiny nail fragments that you will immediately feel  It is literally that freaking sensitive I LOVE it!  But, the bottom right side of the mouse is the only place it doesn\u2019t have a sliding pad, and every now and then the mouse pad will deform ever so slightly making the plastic scrape and it will drive you nuts trying to find the phantom dust until you realize it is the mouse bottom. You kind have to scrape the plastic smooth again and kind of deform the mouse back. I guess I now use it very delicately so as not to put weight or pressure on the outer side of my hand. But when I\u2019m tried and lie back and quickly drag the mouse to the right of the screen, or those rare quake champions breaks (yes I\u2019m an old fogey) when I\u2019m tracking right on someone and my muscle memory kicks in then scraaaaaaaape. It feels so much worse simply because otherwise it is so beautifully smooth. A shame. I pray they quickly release an update for this mouse because it is perfect in every other way, as if I had designed it myself. Not a fan of rgb vomit, but this one is on the subtle undertone side and is quite pretty. (I turned it off on the mouse pad though). It\u2019s a great mouse that maybe will work with your hand weight. Or maybe I got a particularly deformed one since no one else is complaining. Just wish they had that one sliding pad on the bottom right, I really wish I could give this five stars \u2026",

          "I have been using the Logitech G700s for a long time. After the last one went sideways, I decided to try a Razer mouse to go with the Razer keyboard I am using. I have big hands and the Basilisk, although it is a bit smaller than the G700s, fits nicely. It has a much lighter feel and I much prefer a corded mouse to a cordless (too many hassles over the years with cordless). It glides very smoothly on a desk or mousepad and the extra buttons are almost all in the right spot. My only recommendation is that they move the third thumb button (closest to the back of the mouse) to under the second button instead of behind it. It's a little difficult to hit back there.The Razer software made setting up this mouse very easy. I have two large screens, so I like my pointer to move very fast. The software has a huge range of mouse speed, from snail to \"they've gone plaid\" so it's sure to have a setting you will prefer.The colors are also nice and easily set up in the software. The wheel has both free spin and click mode. Free spin sometimes scrolls when I move the pointer, but it's rare and avoidable by switching to click mode.All in all, its a great mouse for the price, and I think I will be sticking with Razer products for a while now. Sorry Logitech.",
          "Es c\u00f3modo, liviano, bonito, es muy personalizable e incluso para trabajar en documentos en los que te desplazas horizontalmente va perfecto porque la ruedita tambi\u00e9n se mueve hacia los lados, amo eso. El agarre es muy bueno, aunque creo que es un poco grande, no lo recomendar\u00eda si tus manos son demasiado peque\u00f1as, no menos de 19 o 20 cm de longitud. El cable es muy liviano, as\u00ed que no molesta para nada.",
          "I love this mouse... but not the complete lack of configuration software for Mac.I purchased this mouse to replace a Logitech MX Master 3 Mac edition, I couldn't handle the Bluetooth lag anymore.\u2022\u00a0The high resolution sensor is truly fantastic, precise and smooth.\u2022\u00a0The feet (gliding pads) are magic.\u2022 The wireless (not using Bluetooth) connection is fantastic, I do not notice any lag, it feels just like a cabled mouse.\u2022 The scroll wheel feels better then the Logitech G502X wheel\u2022 The side scrolling left-right tilt works very well in Xcode storyboards and Photoshop, again better than the Logitech G502X.\u2022\u00a0The shape of the mouse is quite comfortable and the grippy texture feels great.But... configuring it using a Mac is impossible (as far as I've been able to find). You need to configure it with Windows and the major settings are stored on the mouse and will work on the Mac. The \"sniper mode\" button configuration does not seem to work on Mac and is always set to its default (which is too slow for me) and the light settings also do not work on Mac (always cycling through the rainbow).I purchased a Logitech G502X Plus Lightspeed at the same time and returned that one. My hand started cramping on that, the movement and handling of the mouse was, to me, not as natural and the scroll wheel was awful. The software for configuring it, though, was great.A truly great mouse let down by complete lack of Razer software support on Mac.",
          "Mouse is very nice. Comfortable, light, nice bright colours, HOWEVER, the battery life with RGB on isnt the best. To get the battery life to last a good while before charging, one would need to disable the RGB and use just the mouse. One plus however is the charging speed. Fully charges within 1 hour. Overall good mouse.",
          "I'd had watching so many YT videos before decided buying this Razer Basilisk V3 mouse because its very positive review. I did not like the shape at first, but I'd have to give it a try.- Ergonomic: 5/5,I believe some people might not like it because of how they hold a mouse.- Hyper scroll: 5/5It kind of weird when using it at first. Once you get used to it, you may not want to use other mouse's scrolling wheels. It is a combination of Free scroll and Tactile scroll where it uses free scroll when you spin faster and switch back to tactile when it stops. Of course, there is an option to either use free or tactile scroll.- LED Brightness: 5/5I believe it is brighter than other mice, no complain.- Lightweight cable: 4.5/5- Tilt Wheel: 5/5Very helpful because I use it very often. Basically, I use it for going back and forth between webpages on a browser or enter/exit folders in Windows explorer.- Button Customization: 3/5The customization level is limited compared to Logitech counterpart. Also, I'm not a fan of hold-and-press 2 buttons on a mouse, so I only have 2 buttons left which I can assign shortcut keys to. While Logitech software allows me to assign macro to a button by apps which mean that a button can have different shortcut keys based on an active app. I know this can be fixed by software update.",
          "i really love this mouse as my old mouse that said it was for gaming didn't even feel like it was made for it but this mouse really feels like it was made for gaming. it feels great in my hand and i like lights. the scroll wheel is also so perfect. it is truly great.",
          "As the title says, there's not much to complain about from me for the most part, the feel of the mouse is great during use, it's averaging around 70+ hours of battery life. It's nice... besides the wheel. The texture on the wheel comes from a rubber/rubberized ring or band around the rest of the wheel which is plastic and has a groove to fit this rubber ring in it. This ring becomes warped over time and use and starts catching on the back part of this metal hook inside that's supposed to provide the tactile scroll feeling I think (the button causes the hook to move into/away from some notches in the wheel). This causes normal scrolling to feel a bit off, and the unlocked/hyperscroll/free-spin of the wheel to stop working as intended as well. It really should've just been one solid piece instead of a rubber band around the wheel. Even if the hook had more space at the back the rubber band would still get so loose over time that it could potentially start slipping off the wheel itself, but even that would at least extend the life of the wheel.This happened fairly quickly to me too, within only a couple months. For the price I just can't really recommend this, you're paying a premium so the build quality and thought put into it should be premium as well."

          "It gets 4 stars because I think this mouse is super freakin nice and also beautiful. The ergonomics, sensor, buttons switches, scroll wheel, feet, rubberized side grips and overall build quality are top notch there are just 2 problems for me:1 -At 96 grams (I've seen it weight in at 100 grams on some scales) It's just too heavy to make it a good gaming mouse and the weight even effects it's use for productivity. This thing feels like a brick to me. I personally really like lightweight mice, extra weight makes every movement less efficient. It also makes it more difficult to pick up off the mouse pad everytime you lift-off. It's a bummer because this mous is basically perfect in every other aspect. If you like heavy mice this might be the one for you.2- also (a smaller problem) is that the cable could be a lot more flexible it's way too stiff especially when compared to the glorious cables which are the best I've tried, it's even stiffer than my Deathadder V2. Overall though I can live with the cable, you still can't feel it when using the mouse.I'm still using the mouse and deciding whether to keep it or not, I really really like it, the cable is acceptable, but the only remaning question is, can I live with the extra weight?",
          "I needed a new mouse for my PC games and it works great! Love that i get to customize everything about the mouse, specially since my man has the same mouse.",
          "I really wanted to like this mouse, as it has the features and tech that I want, and it's made by a company with good support.  Unfortunately, it's just not comfortable enough for me to use for more than a few minutes.I'm fine with the claw, palm, and fingertip grip styles, so I wasn't concerned about this being designed around a palm-grip.  That wasn't an issue for me.  Instead, it's that it's poorly shaped for any of those grips.The mouse is large, which is normally fine.  Unfortunately, the sides of the mouse make it even larger.  The left side has a slight outward taper, and the right side has a pronounced outward taper.  The tapered sides are covered with a low-friction rubber, making them even more useless to grip.  Because of this, my hand fatigues quickly when using the mouse, as the wide palm and wider, slippery \"grip\" areas make it harder to control than it should be.Typically, most mice (even palm-style) taper inward or straight down before tapering out on the sides.  This allows a place for the fingers and thumb to rest, and allows them to be used for control.  The Mamba appeared to be the same in the pictures, but it really isn't.My son and my GF both tried it as well, and neither liked it.  I brought it into work, offering it to any coworker who wanted it.  Many tried it, but no one liked it.  Finally, one took it home to give to his kid.  I feel sorry for that kid.There are far better mice for this price, for all styles.  Light or not, big or little, palm or claw or fingertip, \"gaming\" or not, each of them is better than this.Maybe the tech is good. Maybe it's durable.  Maybe the quality of components is top notch.  Maybe the software is even good.  I simply don't know, as I refuse to use it long enough to find out.This might fit your hands well.  Many people here seem to like it.  Not me.  Good luck!",
          "Using this mouse for a year and a half, roughly 2000 hours, I was able to reach a semi-professional level in 2 FPS games using this mouse. Though heavier than it\u2019s better versions, it\u2019s amazing for its price and very durable.",
          "I have been using this mouse for about 6-8 months now and so far it seems to hold up and works the way it is supposed to. The pros of the mouse is that it has a very nice ergonomic design and this mouse is built for the people who like to \"palm\" their mouse. Another pro is the wireless setting is a very nice addition to this mouse and I love it, the battery also seems to hold up very well (the battery life lasts about 24-48 hours depending on how long you charge it). The mouse is also lightweight which is very nice when playing games. Now there are a few cons of this mouse such as the left click not working very well, sometimes I will try to shoot a gun in a fps game and it wont fire at all (I have found it very annoying sometimes). However it seems to go away after sometime. Another con is the dpi wont change if you have the mouse on wireless mode. But other than that it is a very nice mouse and would recommend.",
          "After just a few months of ownership, Razer already listed this as a \"legacy device\" on their website. And it was released in late 2018, so that was a very brief lifespan before entering obsolescence. However, I can see why they wouldn't want to maintain much effort behind this product, as it has a number of flaws:The mechanical switches are very finicky. As others have stated, it often just lets go while clicking and dragging. A blast of canned air with the nozzle wedged under the LMB seems to get it back on track, but that's way too finicky for a product advertising switches as having high end switches with a superior lifespan. I keep my workspace clean, so either a very minor particle was able to take down this mouse, or something in the switch just gets jostled out of place over time, and prying the button back to spray the air for it properly reseated.Battery life is ABYSMAL - has been from the initial time of purchase, and has only gotten worse. Plugging this in every other day to keep it alive. My old Logitech could go for a week for both full time work use and gaming. The 50 hours advertised is laughable - nowhere close.The cable: I get that this mouse came out when micro-USB was still popular, so I can't complain about that. But this particular connector is like a puzzle to connect, such that you can not use any cable other than the original. Be very careful not to lose or damage the cable. Very strange and annoying design choice.Ergonomically, it's great, but even back then they were charging $100 for it, this was never a premium mouse. There are just too many deal breakers. And with options available today, it still makes no sense at less than half that price, especially since this is now an obsolete legacy device.Final verdict: love using this when it works, and though it does have its issues, I still love Razer products overall. This send to be one of their more middling ones though. I feel like many of the issues are resolved now with their new lines that use optical switches, have the option to switch to Bluetooth to save battery even low latency isn't required, and cut the cable with docking cables. I'll keep using this one until it gives up before I make that switch though.",

          "Mouse works fine, but the microUSB charge port in the front is designed so that only the provided cable can fit in the slot. Standard microUSB cables are too wide to fit - the slot in the mouse literally has plastic tabs to block standard cables from entering. The provided cable has two grooves cut into it that are able to slide past the plastic tabs, which is why it's the only one of my 20+ microUSB cables that works with the thing. Don't misplace your cable if you want to be able to charge it.",

          "Purchased this mouse quite some time ago, it is now after about 2 years in a state I would consider to be functionally broken.It worked exactly as expected for roughly a year after which time the mouse wheel became... fuzzy not at all consistent or reliable. I don't count on the wheel very often so I dealt with that for about 6 months or so before the right click started being inconsistent. I tried adjusting it and even disassembled it entirely at one point in an attempt to fix the right click. I was unable to get it working consistently again.It was a good mouse for about a year and a more or less functional one for about a year and a half of what most people would likely consider to be heavy use with basic cleaning and maintenance. The battery never gave me any trouble, but the mechanical parts of the mouse did breakdown over time.As a comparison I have a little wireless 12 dollar mouse I also got through amazon that has outlived it and continues to function just fine. I understand from my general attempts at troubleshooting that the mouse wheel going 'fuzzy' is actually a common issue with these, there are 'fixes' provided by users on youtube. I found said fixes to be more trouble and involved than they were really worth to me.tl;dr Decent product but with a seemingly limited lifespan on some of the mechanical parts.",
          "\u00a0I have chronic pain in my hands and wrist so it was important to me to find a mouse that would help give me comfort while gaming. So far this mouse has been great! I even ordered extra so I can use one for work and to have one on hand.",
          "I'm on my second one of these. Why 2nd? Well, you see I'm quite the gamer and it seems that my body heat melted the adhesive on the side where I rest my thumb. It started leaking gooey stuff out of the sides then the rubber part just came off and under it was a gel residue.This aside, it's pretty cheap, fits my hand, has performance enhancing RGB, and it took a couple years for the above thing to happen.",
          "I like this product a lot but I do have a issue, their is a app you have to figure out by yourself but with the help of YouTube it\u2019s easy to figure out. Second your DPI starts off at 750 it\u2019s very fast so adjust your mouse because that cursor goes fast",
          "I love the mouse in general, haven't had an issue with it for the first 9 months, but after which the left click on the mouse has been kinda moody. I haven't abused the mouse, mostly using right clicks for league, and yet the left is still bad. Looked at other reviews and it looks like other people have this issue also. Kind of a shame honestly, I liked this mouse a lot and didn't think i'd be changing to a different one",
          "This was previously Razers top tier mouse.  Featuring top of the line everything from sensor to lighting, to being wireless, to having its own stand.  The Mamba is what started the trends and was the pinnacle that other mice tried to replicate.However, with this, the second generation, Razer made a dire mistake.  They released the Mamba Tournament Edition, trying to cater to hard core gamers, but unfortunately, they chose a laser instead of an optical sensor and it had some performance issues compared to Razers other mice which all used optical sensors and because of this, the mouse got a bad reputation.Razer later released a newer version, updated with THE BEST optical sensor made at the time (still great even today), better than all others, with Omron switches (best at the time and still great today) and it solved all the problems, but by then, the name \u201cMamba\u201d was synonymous with shitty lasers, and so no one went after it, and there were barely any reviews.But as someone who had a Deathadder that finally bit the dust and wanted an upgrade, after testing out every mouse there was, my choice came down to either the Razer Viper or this Mamba, and the Mamba just felt perfect for my large hands.  Thumb buttons were perfect, shape was perfect, and even the side grips were placed so much better than my Death Adder.Additionally, it\u2019s one of the very few Razer mice that offers mouse wheel tilt, which gives it 2 additional buttons to hotkey, which was a game changer in terms of competitive gaming.I still use and adore it to this day and I\u2019ve tried a lot of the latest models and I still like this mouse.  If you have large hands, are right handed, and want a somewhat basic mouse with the best sensor (I think it might still be Razers best) and two more programmable buttons than a generic basic mouse, then give it a try.  It\u2019s under 100g which, although not as light as a Glorious Model O, it\u2019s still lighter than most none-perforated mice (mice with holes all over it to save material weight).This is still the best mouse in Razers lineup, in my opinion.  At the very least, the most underrated.",
          "This mouse is awesome!Before I bought the Mamba Wireless I used to own a Wired Deathadder Elite, but I noticed that sometimes clicks wouldn't register, so I knew it was time to upgrade. I decided to go wireless this time so that I wouldn't have to deal with anymore cables (Apart from the charging cable), and I think I made a very good choice.For those that complain about the amount of time you get for a full charge, this issue is completely mitigated if you charge the mouse every night before you go to sleep, which is what I do. Every morning I wake up, I have a full charge ready to go. Other than that, the ergonomics for me at least are a bit off since I have slightly bigger hands, but I can still manage with it.Apart from being a great gaming mouse (With all the programmable buttons, profiles, DPI stages, etc etc), it works nicely as a good general purpose mouse.I only have two nitpicks, 1 is that sometimes the lights change when I don't want it to, but I suspect this just might be a result of Synapse 3 not working well, and my other nitpick is how the mouse behaves when you plug it in to charge:- When the charging cable is plugged in directly to the computer and you plug the mouse in, it turns off for a second or two and then comes back on, to which you can continue to use it normally.- When the charging cable is not plugged into the computer (maybe via a brick in an outlet or a power strip that has USB ports (this is how I charge my mouse)), even if the mouse is on, the mouse will turn off and not turn back on.Strange behavior, but concerning how I never use it plugged in but wireless (that's the point, isn't it?), I have had no problems.Overall, I got this mouse on sale for $45, and I think it was a great choice. I would definitely recommend this mouse for others to use.",
          "If you are a gamer or a fan of Led/RGB lights, this mouse is a must. It is pretty bright and responsive, you can change the sensibility with the two upper button and assign uses for the side button, also the wheel not just let you scroll pages, it also let you move faster across pages, even with out any configuration. You can install Razer Synapse App, but it isnt required to function, only you just get the basic pattern of lights changing, but if you use the app, it let you save some profiles and change with a button under the mouse. The mouse is pretty big but feels amazing in your hand and you soon forget about this.",
          "Me likey:+ Features a rechargeable battery+ It supports both wireless and wired connection+ If you like other Razer mice, it doesn\u2019t stray too far from the design+ It\u2019s reliable and accurate+ I got it for about $40Trying to think of some cons for my list, and I just can\u2019t find any. Sure, there are cheaper mice, and the ergonomics of each mouse is subjective, but I don\u2019t have any legitimate complaints. The wireless Mamba has everything I\u2019m looking for: An accurate, reliable gaming mouse that supports both wireless and wired connections, without the need for AA batteries.",
          "This mouse was great, the battery life was great on it and it felt good on my hand. Don\u2019t have it anymore because I bought an ambidextrous razer mouse and gave this one away but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still holding up well",
          "A long time ago in my PC gaming life I got a Logitech MX518 gaming mouse after using an MX510.  A mouse that these days is over a decade old.  I retired it after I got to trading in the mouse for a new one.  I went from Steelseries Ikari to Razer Deathadder to Razer Diamondback Chroma to Cooler Master Storm Sentinel III.  Some mice were better than others but none allowed me to play like I did with my Logitech MX518 nor as well...until the Razer Mamba Elite.I got it on a hunch and the fact it was nearly half off in price during the holidays.  Once I started using it the first thing I noticed that I had finally found my true successor to the MX518 was that the ergonomically contoured shape of the Mamba Elite was very similar to the MX518.  It felt very similar and very comfortable.  The second thing I noticed is that all the action buttons were in exactly the right place for my hand.  I didn't have to strain or stress my hand any to get to them...just like the MX518.  The third thing I noticed is that Razer Synapse 3.5 was finally mature enough where I could trust its driver and feature set.  Finally, the RGB is a great touch as well.The Mamba Elite is a mouse where if you loved Logitech's old MX510 or MX518 mice from years past like I did this will bring you back to that time and really make you enjoy gaming like you did with that mouse and maybe bring some of the talent back other mice took away because of how they fit your hand and their overall design.  Those sort of things really do make a difference in your gaming life as they are a little thing but in reality...they mean a lot.  That's all I got and until next time I am out!",
          "I decided to finally update my aging Logitech gaming mouse. Had 2 Logitech gaming mice and still using the 2and one on my laptop now.This Razer mouse has a much nicer feel overall, it is amazing at how well it responds to your movement.The mouse is a good sized, nicely weighted comfortable feeling in the hand mouse.If you own a Razer chroma keyboard then you already know you need to connect to the internet to use more advanced features.I own a Black Widow keyboard and as soon as I connected the mouse they recognized each other and updated software downloaded and installed dated my reviewing it.The new arrangement now allows both devices to have the same pr similar light functions. This is pretty cool looking if you ask me.If LED is not your thing then by all means skip on any noise with LED features.However, if like me you got a Razer chroma keyboard then you love your LED lights.Now the lights on the mouse as is with the keyboard are the icing on the already amazing cake. And, unlike Portal thos cake is real.The wheel is amazingly sensitive. Has a lumpy rubberized surface making it very nice to touch and use.The wheel has multiple click options one being a light press you can access the menu options to open a new tab and such.Press a little harder or a normal press on my old gaming mouse and it allows you to scroll around the screen just by moving the mouse. That one takes getting used to. Not sure if this is something you can change yet.Theforqard and back buttons are located spot on perfect for my hands. I am a size large glove to give you a reference.You can use the DPI buttons right in front of the wheel to adjust things on the fly. And, let me tell you this  is amazing when you need the accuracy for certain needs and don't for others.The only con I can think of is the price point.However, for that price you get one amazing mouse.Also, to add more icing ot sprinkles to the cake you get some cool Razer themed stickers My Balckwidow keyboard didn't come with stickers that I recall.Overall this is a wonderful mouse packed with all sorts of actual features. With the added fun of LED light and ddcdirent and new modes compared to my keyboard. Works flawlessly with my Razer keyboard.Highly recommend.",
          "This mouse surprised me. I read so many bad reviews about the mouse itself or the software and I am so shocked that people feel the way they do. Sure the software isn't the best it could be but it works well and gets the job done. But I'll say I do not mess with it too much once I have things set how I like.I have been through so many mice over the last year.Coolermaster CM710 (incredible mouse but too small for my hands)Zowie EC2 (very slick and slips in my hands but is a good size. Cable is unbelievably thick and stiff though)Logitech G403 (as a mouse it's a great design but logitech's software is miserable and doesn't recognize the mouse half the time and between two of these G403's the left click went out within 2mo of playing FPS games where it became incredibly inconsistent in registering the click)Glorious Model D (great mouse overall but the cord got annoying. The Coolermaster cable is similar to this one but doesn't flail around and land on your hand like this one's does and even their own mouse bungee didn't secure the cord as it would slip out of the connector - but great quality mouse)Going through these mice is what led me to finally going with the Razer Mamba. I was ready to get away from dealing with cables now that the wireless tech seems to finally be here and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I have spent hundreds on them over the last year and I wasn't sure I'd like Razer so I wanted to keep the investment minimal. Well, despite buying this at a pretty low price (I believe around $50) it has become a top 3 favorite mouse for me. I know it's not some super fancy mouse with tons of features but all I really cared about was reliable wireless, forward/back buttons, a nice fit for my hand, not too heavy.So far after about 2 months this has been THE mouse for me. I don't know a lot about other Razer products but I will say that I will look to their mice before any other brand unless I experience something worth skipping them and so far I'm not seeing that happening. I will update if it does since i've only had it about 50 days but so far so great!",
          "UPDATE:The videogame I play (quakelive) requires me to press both mouse buttons at the same time. For some reason, when I do this, the mouse won't work when you press both of them. Really annoying. It's like if the interface was designed to pick up clicks from a single button at a time. I will keep this mouse because it's comfortable to use if you aren't gaming, but I will definitely recommend a different one for gaming.-----------------------------I just received my new Razer Mamba wireless mouse, and I'm honestly very satisfied with it. It feels good in my hand, the clicks feel good, and it's very responsive. I always wanted to get a Razer mouse, so as a first time Razer user I think it's a great starting point.WHAT I LOVE:- RGB Effects: I used Chroma Studio to create led effects. You can set the lights to change color or to light up from your microphone or speaker sounds, you can set light effects when clicking the mouse, you can make it \"breathe\", etc... You can pretty much create any visual effect you want with it.- Ergonometric Design: My hand feels very comfortable when using this mouse!- Smoothness: I got a goliathus mouse pad as I'm always carrying my laptop around. Combining this mouse with a \"low end\" razer mouse pad is enough to get a great experience from this mouse.- Mouse Wheel Grip: The mouse wheel has little studs which helps you get a better grip when spinning it. I really liked this feature.- Side Buttons: The side buttons don't get in the way when grabbing the mouse. You won't be clicking them by accident or anything.RESPONSES TO BAD COMMENTS- Not Being Able to Use It When Charging: This is not true. I just tested it, and it works! Windows just automatically installs a new driver to use it as a regular wired mouse. I reckon people's windows security settings were blocking the download of the new driver?- Clicking and Dragging Issues:  I haven't had any issues so far. I'll update post if the problem develops.- Bad Battery Life: I charged it 20 hours ago, and I'm still at 85%. I give my mouse heavy use doing CAD models and gaming in my free time. I'm very surprised I haven't needed to charge it considering I'm running a ton of RGB effects when clicking, \"breathing\" effects, and when I speak on the microphone.- Razer Synapse Software: I honestly don't understand why people were having issues with the software not being compatible with the mouse. The software has a super easy user interface and it works very well.- Need to Turn Off After Use: A lot of people said they needed to turn their mouse off after use to avoid battery drainage. I don't think this is necessary. The mouse goes to sleep mode when you don't use it. I left it on all night list night, and it did not drain my battery.Honestly, if you like how the mouse looks, buy it and give it a try! I feel satisfied with this mouse so far, so I would recommend it to anyone.",
          "After using my old mouse for so long, this one feels amazing in my hand. Its smooth and comfortable to hold. I love that you can set up the colors however you want. And all ofbthe programmable buttons are a plus!",
          "I needed a new gaming mouse. I thought I was looking for reliability, for something that fit well in my hands as a disabled woman with small hands and that of course had rainbow lights because that's how you can tell it's for gaming. I did not realize my parrot was going to fall in love with it just as quickly as I did on first use. The hand feel is great. The response is amazing and customizable which is something I didn't even realize I wanted until I had it. Now I just have to schedule my gaming for when the bird is napping.",
          "Es perfecto.",
          "Easy to use and colorful",
          "Amazing for what you pay for it. It's heavy enough yet light that it doesn't feel like some of the 'cheaper' mice you might end up finding. It has a lot of functionality. The left click is quiet enough that you can't hear it over my microphone. The right click feels kinda.. gummy. Almost like it doesn't want to click. (I don't mind it that much.) The thumb side buttons are so LOUD. And I never remember that my scroll wheel has the function to click to the left or the right.. so there is that.Customizing the DPI is nice though. I set mine to 3500 and it feels amazing. It can be set from 100 all the way up to 16000.Honestly have to say its a really nice mouse. The color changing options with Razers program Chroma and everything else made it so I could match the color to all my LEDs and RGB inside my tower.I'd say over all a 4/5 just because of the differences in the clicks on the mouse and the loud clicks the thumb side mouse buttons make.",
          "a gamer i'm not. been there, enjoyed the hell out it but have struggled gettin' back in that groove these days. in my day-to-day, i do have an appreciation for precision and this mamba elite fits the bill nicely! now i've only been using it for a few hours but am impressed with its fluidity especially when compared to the logitech it replaced.you will need the razor synapse app to configure and it's fairly intuitive. the mouse has a tilt scroll feature which is a must have for me but it has to be set to operate as such if one prefers horizontal scrolling. what would've been nice is a continuous scroll if the scroll wheel is held in the tilt position; for now, it's a one-to-one ratio.the backlight is nice and it matches the razor 27 monitor colors. i'm embarrassed to say that's the primary reason for the$60 purchase and i'm glad i did. got lucky when it dropped from $73 before i bought but was very hesitant at that hi-dollar amount as well. i have it set on static - so nothing fancy or distracting, just a soft color. the feel is superb as it's ever so slightly larger than the logitech it replaces. so when online and in a darkened room, the cool factor is through the roof!!the default performance setting is 1800 dpi (stage 2) and is perfect for my needs. u can increase / decrease it to your personal taste. i will have to see if these settings are available via the win 10 os.bottom line - i'm lovin' it.",
          "I love this mouse! I've used it both at home for gaming and at work. The thing has been a champ in my backpack. Love how light, comfortable, and flexible it is.I only have two problems with it:1. I hate that Windows basically requires you to install the Razer software (it will automatically try to install it as soon as the mouse is plugged in). Luckily on Ubuntu, it works out of the box with no software required. But that's the life of modern gaming. You've got your software for your mouse, another for your keyboard, another for your headset, another for your harddrive, and on and on. Unless you choose one company for it all, I guess.2. The second problem is the buttons. After two and a half years of faithful service, my left click button has developed the dreaded issue I've seen others mention. When clicked down, the button will multi-click, instead of staying clicked. This makes drag and drop functionality impossible.But hey, I love Razer mice. I already have two, and I just ordered another wireless one to replace this. I'll miss you, Mamba. We've built some beautiful things together. I would definitely rate it lower if I had bought it for full price though. It goes on discount often. Buy it then!",
          "Mouse works great, high resolution.No idea what sleep mode is, colors maybe?  I dunno, don't care.It is fairly comfortable, but i occasionally hit the center buttons when I get tired.Biggest issue is the bottom isn't absolutely flat, lots of little grooves, so it gets stuff in there, and when combined with a hard razor mat, it means it frequently doesn't move quite right.",
          "Great product,  quality,  and love the cable length,  definitely recommended",
          "This mouse is almost perfect for me. It fits big hands, in fact, I downgraded from a Viper Ultimate to this one, because unfortunately, the lower height of the Viper Ultimate made it uncomfortable to use at this hand size. Although this one has a similar feel, overall it's much better.It's not comfortable to rest your pinky and ring fingers on the edge of the button, on the edge of the indentation. So with thick fingers, these two fingers come together and stick together on the right side of the mouse, which is not a comfortable feeling, especially when playing. But it's still better than the Ultimate, which is lower.Perhaps what might cause a problem, later on, is the unique cable for charging. I can't even plug in the thinnest micro USB cable, because the two guide rails that the factory cable runs/attaches to won't let even the smallest headed cable in.  Of course, this design is understandable, as it keeps the cable stable so it doesn't fall out during use.I've only had it for two months, so of course, I don't know what it will look like in a year. But for now, it's almost perfect.The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth is that it's almost nowhere to be found. That leaves Amazon in the US, where it costs almost $32 including customs, which is almost half the purchase price. However, on Razer's site, for the big hand, for full grip/fps, this is the only recommended/available model without thousands of unnecessary buttons.",
          "Bought 1 for me, 1 for a friend. The one I use is amazing, I love synaps to customise the keybinds and cortex for gaming. I also recommend a mamba wireless, I've had that for a couple of years botlw and it has done me good. (Mamba elite's 2 extra buttons are when you pivot the scroll wheel left and right.)",
          "good quality, useful and practical for work.",
          "The mouse is great! Very comfortable in the hand!",
          "this mouse is ok. the scroll wheel on mine has started to act up intermittently but other than that it still works fine. Razer Synapse is awful. it's laggy, buggy, and doesn't even perform basic function (like display battery level) correctly sometimes. Especially egregious considering the battery status isn't communicated to Windows in any other way like most other devices do. The \"custom rgb\" color selection is finicky and what the mouse actually displays sometimes does not match the color(s) you've selected even remotely. if you could do things like see the battery status, change lighting, and set dpi mode settings in any other way it would be much better. This product is hindered by being locked to bad software just like Logitech mice and G Hub.",
          "Bought this mouse because I wanted to cut some cords and I do spend a good amount of time gamingand  Razer is a well known brand in the gaming community. The mouse is not one of those over complicated mice that have about 13 buttons and a sink stuck to the side of it which was perfect for me, what it does have is 2 buttons under the thumb which are SUPER convenient and SUPER easy to press/reach (suits my needs in World of Warcraft perfectly). It has a little but of Chorma light  on the mouse wheel and of course naturally the Razer symbol lights up beautifully. Software was easy as 1,2....done, as soon as you plug the mouse in the installer wizard takes off and before you know it you are done. I love I can customize the lights in a dozen or more ways using the software and I can match the lights on the mouse to the lights on my Razer Kraken Kitty edition headset ( I have a pretty fly set up). The material of the mouse is NOT what I had expected it to be, photos are deceiving. Initially I was disappointed I had thought it was made out of that soft touch plastic but it wasn't but now I kinda like it just the way it is and think it's a great choice (the soft touch plastic would get greasy/oily/dirty in no time). This mouse is EXTREMELY light  weight for a wireless mouse which was a great surprise (I think its only 4 oz) while my wired mouse weighs a ton compared to it. The plastic the mouse is made of can seem like it's cheap but I assure you - touch is deceiving, it's a tough - durable mouse that's overcome with flying colors being dropped, sliding off my table and *drum roll please* a TODDLER harassing it non stop (toddlers are like fish - show them something shiny or color changing and they are hooked). The overall shape of the mouse is underwhelming  but that's not a bad thing, it's actually kind of perfect truth be told, it fits in my hand so well it's like I had been using this mouse for the last 10 years and had worked it in already...that's worth it's weight in gold in my books.Now time for the bad...The bad...While the mouse is meant to be a wireless mouse there are times it does need to be plugged in (to charge and it does work just as well plugged in). The Razer store page for the Mamba clains it lasts 5 hours however after 1.5 days of use or a full 24 hours the mouse starts to blink red which signifies it needs to be charged. That's rather fast, much faster than I was expecting. I turn the mouse OFF when it's not in use so it's not irresponsible ownership draining the battery. I feel like every time I'm turning around the mouse is screaming at me it needs to be plugged in. I did not enjoy trying to figure out how to charge the mouse - that made me chase rabbit trails. I tried the book, I did't find what I needed in the book, I tried Google but Google referenced some sort of charging dock which is no longer made or sold, I tried plugging it in and charging it with my apple block I tried plugging it into the laptop and none of that seemed to work (even over night plugged in) turns out it needed to be plugged INTO my laptop and the switch underneath needed to be in the OFF position, such a simple thing you'd think I would have assumed that. Once I clued in it charged like a charm.Last thoughts...I love the mouse despite the poor battery life and the fact I still feel connected to wires. It looks good, feels good and works amazing!! Hands down best mouse I've ever bought for gaming and I've been gaming a VERY long time  (23 years to be exact). I will definitely buy another when this one dies (provided they are still made and sold by that time). To tell you how good this mouse feels I told my husband if I was rich I would buy EVERY single person in my WOW guild (retail AND classic) one of these mice (yes it's that good imho).",
          "Like everyone else mentions, the mouse will eventually have problems clicking without double clicking or having other weird click problems. Besides this massive(!!) issue, the mouse is really good! Sucks it is ruined by this design flaw.",
          "I'm a big fan of Razer peripherals for gaming. I use a Razer mouse on my gaming PC. At my office, I wanted a new mouse that didn't suck. While not strictly for gaming, a good gaming mouse is also a really good productivity mouse.I use it with a 2018 Mac Mini. It's excellent, ergonomically very good, comfortable, reliable, and accurate. It's light, it slides easily across a desk mat. It's everything a great mouse should be.I have two primary concerns.First, the software. The software actually forced me to reinstall macOS. Scrolling through Reddit and elsewhere; apparently that's a common issue. The website does NOT state that it's compatible with the latest macOS, but it also fails to mention such an OS-breaking compatibility issue. (Once installed, it won't boot). There is no software, therefore, for macOS. I realize this is a gaming mouse and Mac gaming is almost nonexistant, so I'm not docking any points here. Still, for those who use this mouse for creative uses or even for simple productivity; it's a shame there isn't decent macOS software. To be clear, it still works just fine. Even DPI switching using the top buttons. But I can't see current battery charge state or control the RGB lighting.I did dock a star because of battery life. It's worse than any wireless mouse I've owned. There's a claimed 50 hours, which is already pretty low-- but acceptable. However what isn't stated is how poor the standby battery life is. It needs charged every few days. My Apple Magic Mouse, and even my old wireless no-name mouse from the mid 2000's that uses a single rechargeable triple A battery will last for weeks.The mouse does go into standby and turn off the RGB (and without macOS software, I can't permanently turn off the RGB to save battery). I'm still giving it 4 stars, I'm still happy I have it. It's certainly not difficult to charge and unlike some (looking at you, Magic Mouse) it can be used while charging. I could even use it as a wired mouse if I wanted, and the cable to do so is included. Still, I would be a lot happier with it if it could handle one full workweek without needing to be charged.",
          "I went through almost every major flagship mouse from all major manufacturers before I found the wireless Mamba. All the Logitech mice felt better shaped initially, but after longer usage I would begin getting a hand cramp. There was just something missing with the Corsair mice I couldn't place. They felt cheap and the mice didn't glide as easily as I like on the pad. I even considered going wired before spending $100 on a mouse, but I decided to try it out because I have a fanatical Razor friend that swears by his Razor mice....yes, \"mice\".So, I bought this mouse after trying the grip out at the store. My first impression is how much I love the slightly raised rubber grips on the sides that allow for easy pickup and movement. Second, I loved that with my rather extreme claw grip it fit me pretty well. After installing the software and using it on my desktop I have to say that it has THE SMOOTHEST sensor I've felt. It's just beyond all others, and I love the Synapse software that allows for DPI shift programming, lighting customization, and custom profiles.Next, my concern was the battery life because with the highest ends of the other brands I was lucky to get 2 days of \"meh\" usage....not heavy or light. The first thing I did in Synapse is disable the LEDs on this mouse, and I continued to use the mouse as I would have my Logitech Marathon I had been trying to break away from. So, leaving the mouse on/standby and probably 4-5 hours of use per day after work and 4-8 hours on the weekend, I went nearly 2 weeks without needing a charge! WOW!!!! Freaking amazing! It's held up too!I did run into one small issue that was throwing me off, though. I've kept my mouse receiver dongle in the same port for years because it's a good reception location, but with the Mamba I started having weird mouse reporting behavior with battery life and profile switching not working. It turned out that it was USB3 port causing interference, so I moved it to USB2 and it seems resolved now. This is a bit odd because my Marathon never cared, but not a huge deal.After 3 hours of Borderlands no cramping, good battery life, amazing feel, and great customization, I could not be happier with my ultimate choice!! ... unless they added hyper scroll option for the scroll wheel like I had on my Marathon. Man, I miss that, but this mouse is awesome!! Make no mistake! I'm very happy with it, and I may have to go to Razor first on future mouse shopping!",
          "I liked the mouse until I started having scroll wheel issues within the first 3 months. So generally good except for a major flaw.Their customer support for getting the warranty was awful. You're lucky if you hear from them once a week. It takes over a month to just get the faulty mouse sent to them. Every detail about it got messed up somewhere along the line (they somehow mixed up my mouse with a wireless headset). When I finally got it to them, they put the wrong address on my package so it got lost by FedEx. After another couple months of one week at a time emails, they finally put in the lost package report to FedEx.THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN. They verified my address then didn't put my apartment number on the packaging. It got misdelivered AGAIN. The only reason I got my package was because I was watching the FedEx tracking like a hawk. Razer verified my address MULTIPLE TIMES and managed to scuff it so badly they lost the replacement mouse TWICE.I'm glad to have the replacement mouse (they sent me a Deathadder Pro V2), but it's so frustrating knowing that if I have any issues it's going to take 3 months to get it fixed because of how awful the customer support is.",
          "I owned two gaming mice prior to this one: a wired Deathadder (2012) and a wired Corsair Harpoon (2019). The Deathadder is  definitely the better of those actually; it feels way nicer in my hand, and the Harpoon's cord is awkward and stiff which makes it hard to use (that one's also a bit small). The only reason I'm not still using the Deathadder is that it's wired and the cord is getting a little worn. I bought this wireless Mamba with the expectation of it being just a straight upgrade to my Deathadder. I was mostly right; it feels exactly the same under my hand as the Deathadder, which is just what I wanted. It also picks up very well, and I've had no problems with connectivity or detection, though I should point out I generally don't use a mouse when gaming; I'm not a FPS/RTS/MOBA guy so I'm not exactly putting it through its paces. The Mamba travels well; one of the reasons I wanted a wireless mouse is because of the convenience when taking my laptop to another room or going out of town. It's handy that I can store the dongle inside the mouse and not having to buy batteries is a big plus. Battery life is acceptable but not spectacular; I charge the mouse overnight every three days or so, and it's not a big hassle to do it.If battery life was my only complaint with this mouse it'd be great, but unfortunately this mouse has an unreliable scroll wheel. It feels less smooth than I'd like and often double-scrolls or reverse-scrolls. It's a shame because that old Deathadder's scroll wheel was just fine, so it's not like Razer can't make a good one\u2014but this wheel has become such an annoyance that I feel compelled to replace the mouse after only half a year of use. I would be tempted to trade up and replace it with a higher-end Razer, since my favorite mouse is still that old Deathadder, but after my experience with this mouse I'm not sure I trust Razer, and I might go with another Corsair or give Logitech a shot instead.Update: I\u2019ve actually had two of these now. The scroll wheel problem got so bad that I submitted a complaint to Razer and sent it back for replacement (thankfully it was still under warranty). After another six months or so the replacement developed exactly the same scroll wheel issue. At this point I\u2019ve had it and I\u2019m done with Razer\u2014I ordered a Logitech G703 to replace it and I\u2019m not looking back.",
          "Overall:Mouse feels good, buttons are responsive, software has a lot of flexibility. My only two complaints are below.Battery life:This could be a 5-star mouse if not for the terrible battery life. It only lasts me 3-4 days before I have to plug it in. Meanwhile, my standard wireless office mouse has no problem running literal years on 2xAA batteries. I really would prefer if the mouse just used AA instead of the internal battery. They would last longer and when they run out, I could simply replace them instead of having to plug in. Also the micro USB port on the mouse has a weird shape to it so that you can only use the cable it comes with. Really bad design on that. I just use it as a wired mouse at this point.Software:It's a huge improvement to the Logitech software I'm coming from: far more intuitive and generally more dependable. However, it's still not 100% at loading up the correct profile for a game. Usually works, but when it doesn't I have to tab out and manually select it. Can be really frustrating for games where the first few seconds of a match are critical.",
          "I've been using the Deathadder Elite for awhile now, but I've run through two of them already where they suffer the same problem: Double-clicking and ghost-clicking.Mamba Elite? No double-clicking and no ghost-clicking. Just a simple mouse with sleek RBG you can actually see that actually works with Synapse Chroma. It has a mid-high profile so it fits well in the palm as I tend to hold the mouse towards the back. The cord is braided and lightweight so it doesn't bunch up as easily. It glides across most mousepads with relative ease, but not too much to go flying off your desk.The sides of the mouse, typically where you grip, have a nice rubberized texture. I've never had issues holding onto a mouse, but it does help. The side mouse buttons are almost flush with the form factor of the mouse, but they're still easy to press and distinguish from each other without having any mis-clicks.Clicking is kind of loud. It's pretty standard for these kind of mice from Razer. Scroll wheel is slightly more forward than I prefer, but it's probably to fit the DPI buttons as there are two different ones so you're not slam shifting just one of them to cycle.The worst part of this mouse that I personally don't like is that it has a two-stage scroll wheel button. You press lightly for the first click and then slightly harder for the second click. While having more buttons without putting additional buttons on the mouse is often a great idea ... This two-stage scroll wheel button is not ideal. You /will/ find yourself pressing your scroll wheel button and hitting BOTH clicks almost every time when you only intend to do one. To make matters worse, the scroll wheel will also register scrolling while clicking as well which can be a nightmare while gaming. Not to mention it's actually really easy to accidentally click the scroll wheel when just scrolling regardless of hand posture.Not a deal breaker, but it means I have to remap controls from scroll wheel or disable any hotkeys because I got tired of accidentally chucking lethal grenades in Call of Duty when I meant to switch weapons.",
          "Looks great, feels great. The middle scroll button is inaccurate. It tries to scroll sometimes when pressing the middle scroll button for a middle click. Scrolling is not consistent with my input - sometimes it scrolls more or less and this is very inconsistent. Sometimes it will work great so it's very annoying when it doesn't work like I expect it to.I'm paying a premium price for this mouse and it doesn't function as good as a basic mouse. It's great that it looks great and feels great but if it doesn't do what I expect a mouse to do well which is click and scroll then what's the point of getting it?The software is annoying. I don't want to use the software but if I turn it off it will default color cycle which I feel like is annoying on purpose so you'll use the software. They spam you with popup ads from the manufacturer so there's an incentive to make you use it or be annoyed. I've had my computer slow down and notice the software is taking up a large chunk of my cpu even though I have a good processor. The good news is it doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough that I'd like to not use it. But again the default color cycling especially at night makes the room all kinds of colors and some are especially noticeable which pulls me out of movies and game immersion. Like this movie is amazing - oh wait my room is BLOOD RED.",
          "I've always wanted the Mamba Tournament edition because it has an amazing shape and awesome lighting. But unfortunately the laser sensor in it is known to have severe issues such as not being able to track pixel to pixel movements and being very sensitive to dust and other debris.But this past Summer Razer finally gave us the Mamba TE shell and lighting but with the PMW3389 sensor, the same one from the Deathadder Elite.The shape is very similar to the Deathadder, but the hump is not as big and the sides are more straight, so its easier to grip if you have smaller hands like me. I can palm grip, and claw grip is perfectly.The buttons are Razer mechanical omron switches, rated for 50 million clicks. Honestly, these are the best mouse switches I have ever used, they feel tactile and responsive, not like older Razer mice where some would feel tactile and others would feel mushy. The side buttons have good travel but can make a buzzing sound if you push them in the wrong way, not complaining though the Logitech G403 and G703 have the same issue. The scroll wheel isn't loose like on earlier copies of this mouse, but it is very stiff, but it works. It also tilts left and right. The DPI buttons are the same as the Deathadder Elite.The sensor is the PMW3389, currently the top optical sensor on the market. And it actually capable of gaming. No spin outs, it tracks pixel perfect movements and has no acceleration. Flawless.The lighting is BEAUTIFUL! In fact its even better than the Mamba Tournament edition, it has more lighting zones which can be customized.Now the software is a pain in the butt. Razer Synapse 3 is known to be buggy but I haven't had performance issues with it. What annoys me is how were forced to use an account with it and how were forced to use it just to tweak mouse settings. It also gives you ad popups for Razer products every once in a while by default, but you can turn that off. But I will be honest, this software is pretty good. You can reprogram the buttons, change lighting settings, profiles, calibrate the sensor and much more. The Chroma studio is also amazing. You can customize each lighting zone to do whatever you want it to do in terms of lighting, and its very easy to create your own custom and advanced lighting effects.Overall I highly recommend this mouse and I'm glad to see Razer stepping up their game. They took a mouse that many people liked for the LED's and finally gave us more options for LED's and a top sensor. Go buy this mouse!",
          "Between the Razer Viper Ultralight, and the Razer DeathAdder v2, I'd pick the Mamba Every single time. It feels PERFECT in a medium sized hand. Will update review if anything goes bad, less than a week of use but LOVE it.",
          "Great mouse for the first year or two, but in my case the left click button started having issues at around 18 months. Now when I try to click-and-drag, it won't stay clicked. It will randomly deselect and re-select rapidly like it \"forgets\" that I'm holding the button down. This makes it a huge headache to work in spreadsheets on my laptop when traveling. I tried updating (and rolling back) drivers, switching and updating productivity software, Razer software, cleaning the sensor, using the mouse wired/wireless, and generally did all the troubleshooting. Swapped in my other Razer mouse (a Deathadder Essential) and the problem instantly disappeared. So it was the mouse. Which is a shame because I really like it otherwise. Luckily I have a Naga Hex on my main computer, and that has been solid for years.For now, if you are considering this mouse I would recommend going with something extremely cheap like the Deathadder Essential or similar, or paying more for something like the Naga Pro."

I tuned mine somewhere in the middle, and it feels butter! It's very easy to customize everything for both gaming and productivity which is why I got it to add to my rotation. I'm knocking off a star though as the overall build quality of this mouse could be better as there's a lot of rattling going on and the mouse feet are a bit scratchy as on one side there is no foot. Overall though it hasn't effected usability much and i really enjoy using this mouse!",
          "I recently purchased this mouse and overall, I am pleased with its performance and the RGB controls with Razer Synapses are great. However, I did notice a lack of a feature that would enhance the user experience. Specifically, there is currently no way to visually display the battery level on the mouse. The only indication of the battery level is a blinking red light when it is critically low and a color change on the dock while charging. I believe this could be improved by allowing users to set the battery level display on the mouse's side 8 zone RGB strip. This would not only enhance the user experience but also add a unique touch to the design. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase but this small improvement would make it even better.",
          "My first flagship mouse was the razer mamba, which had a peeling rubber grip (likely due to arizona heat and not necessarily razer's fault, glue was actually peeling from my Chevy Sonic too) and eventually double click issues from mechanical switches after about a year of use.  Switched to a g703 which was a fantastic mouse, no rubber grips to peel, but developed double clicks after about 6 months of use.  I have decided I was sick of mechanical switches and went for optical.  Razer is the only reliable optical switch on the market so far.  So I got a viper, which is a fantastic fingertip grip mouse when I'm gaming, but it cannot palm grip.  I'm more of an artist and editor than a gamer, so I needed a reliable mouse that can palm grip, my long fingers on the super thin viper was making my wrist hurt.If you're trying to decide between the viper and the basilisk there's a few things to keep in mind.The basilisk seems to have newer optical switches than the viper.  I ended up with a gen 1 viper and gen 2 vipers cannot be guaranteed, even from razer, let alone a refurbisher that deals with a lot of returns.  It's actually why I bought this mouse from razer this time instead of a refurbisher, but there doesn't seem to be any complains online about spongey clicks with this mouse like there were about the viper.  The basilisk does have an issue with wobbly clickers, didn't happen on my model, this is a defect that is replaceable unlike the gen 1 switch issue if it does happen.Despite the look of the basilisk, gamers will probably prefer the viper.  The viper is not comfortable to me.  And I think it's because all my life, even if it was a cheap office mouse, I've been using ergonomic mice.  This mouse is heavy.  It can be fingertip gripped but if you can fingertip and you play fps you would prefer the viper.  I might not return my viper because I actually do like how lightweight it is for games, but I definitely prefer the ergonomics on the basilisk.  I cannot palm grip my viper.I prefer the basilisk, fingertip and claw grippers probably won't.  I'm a special case,  I cannot palm the viper",
          "I use the original G502 before hero came out for years then moved to the M65 which I loved.Now I have a NEW wireless set up using the G915 keyboard, I\u2019ve been searching for the best WIRELESS gaming mouse for myself. I BOUGHT and RETURNED: G703, G902, G PRO, G502 LS, Dark Core, Razer mamba & viper. I was going to stick with the viper even thro it was too small for my larger right hand. Until I seen the Basilisk Ultimate release. Returned the Viper tried out the Basilisk and now my new wireless set up is completed. This is a true G502 killer, if you bought the G502LS well return it and buy this. The thumb paddle is better to press than the G502 and the Basilisk PTFE feet glides so smooth/feels better in my hand and RBS is amazing compeer to all wireless mouse and to top that off it weighs less with no double click issues and a RBG charging dockI really like the IDEA of the thumb \u201cClutch/Paddle\u201d button but I do wish the piece was longer.I would of taking less battery power option if they could have got this down to 99g or less.Customizable Scroll Wheel Resistance is a fantastic idea to compete with Logitech free wheel.Every company should now be using PTFE feet glides. Good job Razer.Razer Synapse 3 works well for me no issues with software. Macros/KeybindsWifi 2.4 Hyperspeed Wireless is amazing NO LAG what\u2019s so everI mostly use the NVIDIA SHEILD TV and play OVERWATCH or when I work from home/laptop.Since I use the Nvidia Shield to play Overwatch I need to map the mouse side buttons to a number/letter to make it work in game on the Shield. This works well and macros too. I have to save all settings to the ON BOARD MEMORY. I wish I had more than 5 profiles but I am happy that I have 5 and not just 1-3I am very DISSAPOINTED that no RBG lighting settings SAVE to OnBoard memory. Even a few simple options to be saved would have been grateful. Oh-well\u2026Basilisk ProsHyperspeed Wireless \u2013 ZERO LAG and 100% amazingThe RGB charging DOCK is simply PERFECT, what a great feature.PTFE glides mouse feet are the best. All mice should come with this.Fits my right larger hand type very well.Love the thumb restClutch/Paddle (sniper) thumb button piece feels GREAT to pressSide buttons are larger than viper buttons.Perfect length on the left/right mouse clicksClicking all buttons feel GREATCustomizable Scroll Wheel Resistance (Logitech free wheel still better)Left/Right wheel buttons are great to have. (I use them for some macros)Works well on the Razer Sphex V2 & SteelSeries QcK mouse padsGrips very well, feels good in handSensor seem to be greatSmall size dongleGlides very wellStill can use wired if neededBattery life is amazingWorks great on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV deviceRBG lighting is absolutely beautiful !On board memory 5 profilesBasilisk Cons! On board memory does NOT save RBG lighting settings =( WTF WHY?The clutch button piece could be LONGER or longer option pieces (still better than G502)Not UBS-C (Doesn\u2019t really matter as there is a charging dock)No Bluetoothbig scroll wheelSome Finger prints showWeight (Could be lighter - #1 thing to improve on)PRICE(But at $170 with dock it\u2019s cheaper than getting a G502LS with charging mat)Its OCT of 2020 and mouse is working great love it. I have dropped mouse on floor few times with no issues still working fantastic. The software could be designed better but it is what it is.",
          "04/27/20 UPDATE to new mouse.+1 For amazon making the replacement process quick and easy. Made the shipping label and got the new mouse ordered on the night of my initial review.+1 New mouse even though ordered on Thursday, didn't ship till 11pm saturday night and arrived sunday maybe like 1pm? So extremely fast turn-around.+1 This mouse works perfectly fine. Getting used to the size and weight was much faster than I thought.+1 Tested the battery life @ 10% lighting, on a static light blue color, and set the mouse to turn off RGB after 5 minutes of no movement. With off and on usage, and gaming in the mix, I got 4 days of battery life total, 3 comfortably, 4th day I felt like charging it. This was about what I expected and I am very happy with its current battery performance.+1 I have no trouble reaching and using the metal side mouse button with my thumb as my discord PTT. I have smallish hands and its comfortable for me. Not sure how people \"can't\" reach it.? Had some issues with synapse not letting me change my mouse color when not on the dock, so I had to make a new profile and delete the original one, then restart the app. Works fine now, could have been me not being familiar with the software so I didn't knock a star off for that.4 Stars only because of the bad QA on the first mouse.Now that I am putting time into this mouse I am happy with my purchase and for the most part my old PROS/CONS are basically the same.---------------------------------------------------OLD INITIAL REVIEW---------------------------------------------------------Currently given a 1 star because within 15 minutes of testing the mouse produces a High pitched \"wet\" click when clicking the LMB (could be because of the switch or sounded like unadhered glue?). Was there every 2-3 clicks and was a higher tone than the actual click so was really annoying. Plus the fact that I could hear it through my open back headphones made that particular mouse a somewhat bad experience. Also It would make the sound when just slightly wiggling the LMB and not actuating the switch.This was as of 04/16/20, should be getting the replacement on the 18th or 19th and I'll update once I've gotten some serious playtime in COD and BFV.PROS-  - Comfortable, Easy to set-up and Synaps was easy to use too.  - RGB set to 10% for the mouse seems to be peoples go-to for battery life/ visuals.  - QUALITY- Razer always has my respect for giving a high quality feel to their products. Even if their QC fails  them at times like mine.  - Charging dock comes with the sticky rubber base in order to keep it from moving around which is nice.  - Optional side mouse button is metal which is nice, and the switch for it is IMO the best feeling switch I've ever felt. Shame M4 and M5 dont feel like it.CONS-  - Can't use mouse.  - Would like to be able to have custom control over Color-to-Battery Life % on the dock.  - Charging dock gets much hotter than I would have expected, I'll probably drop the brightness on that as  well to see if that cools it down.  - Personal Bias, not a fault of the mouse, I come from using a Rival 300 for a few years, so I'm used to fat heavy mice. Even though its supposed to be about 18% lighter, I don't really feel it.  - Not a fan of the hard plastic they use for the pads, my Rival 300's pads glide much smoother over my new (2 months old) Corsair MM350 XL, the basilisk has a bunch of resistance almost like I can feel it getting caught on individual strands on the mouse mat.  - USB dongle feels very loose in the dock when inserted.  - As far as I could fine you can't set the additional side mouse button to be like a \"M6\" , it can be literally binded to any type of command imaginable. I could probably set it to flush my toilet, but it can't be its own standalone key.",

          "I ordered this mouse in as it was the same design as the G502 that I very much enjoyed, but I wanted to keep my peripherals matched with my other Razer products, as well as my recent experience with the \"updated\" Logitech G Hub app was VERY frustrating and not enjoyable. I use this both for work and play at home for many games.The design itself is great and feels very nice to use with my preferred fingertip/claw grip. The biggest complaints about the mouse fall into this field for me though as I very much miss the 2 buttons on the left mouse button that are present in the G502, but are missing in this rendition, however this is not to be faulted against Razer as that is a different mouse, just something I'd love to see. The other complaint is the removable thumb paddle which is very short and difficult to reach without readjusting your grip. The last minor complaint is that the underside compartment where the USB dongle can be stored is a very cheap plastic door that I can see breaking or becoming lost after extended use. It would have been nice to see a more stable hinged or sliding door to house the USB when traveling. Aside from that, the buttons feel responsive and pleasant, and the scroll wheel resistance settings are much more preferred rather than just tactile or free spin. The mouse feels light and sturdy enough that I don't ever find myself thinking it feels cheap, and the grip texture along the sides of the mouse is comfortable and doesn't appear to be wearing off so far.As for the functionality of the mouse, the connection speed and response time is incredible! The mouse reacts as fast as a wired mouse with no hiccups that I've encountered so far. The 20k DPI is ridiculous to say the least and I could never see it being used by myself, but it's fun to see the point scream across my monitors at a mere jostle of the mouse. The battery life of my mouse when I first received it was dismal at best and I was very disappointed to see the battery life drop from ~90% to ~60% after sitting on my desk TURNED OFF for a few hours. I charged to full a few times and was still encountering the issue, so I reached out to Razer Support. They provided me a firmware update file, something that I thought the Synapse app would have done, and after following the instructions to update the mouse, it has been night and day difference! Now my mouse lasts MUCH longer even when left on, with a sleep timer set, while having the RGB brightness set to 30%. Between going from work to home, I use this thing for upwards of 12hrs a day and I can last about 3-4 days before needing to charge.Overall, I very much enjoy this mouse after the Firmware Update was applied and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the feel/style of the Logitech G502, but want to try out something different. I would love to compare the wireless G502 to this one, but I don't have the pocket money to do that. So take this review as simply a review of the mouse and G502 \"fashion\" comparison.",

          "I love this mouse, super light weight, responsive, and the thumb trigger is my favorite addition... I don't need MMO style mice with 100 extra buttons, but this additional trigger is absolutely perfect, so great I bought another one of these mice a few days later for my other computer.",
          "I bought this mouse for its use of optical switches for the left/right mouse click, very high DPI, low latency and Razer's reputation.  Unfortunately, because of buggy software and tracking issues, I had to return my purchase and change my review to 1 star.The mouse was smaller than I expected. For example, when I grab it, there's a 3 inch gap between the back of the mouse, and my palm. Unfortunately, nearly all mice are being made smaller these days. I'm guessing this is due to the average hand size found around the world.  It's too bad no one builds a \"big and tall\" version mouse and keyboard too.  Oh, and this is right hand mouse only (I'm right handed so no issue for me).  I did not rate my review score on size, because my hands are larger than most.The DPI is great, and almost too much for any real application. It's way more than what's needed, but really cool. I'm very impressed by the detail this mouse can crank out.The LED lights are pretty, colorful and the software has a lot of cool customizations. No complaints there.  What would be nice is the special purpose buttons had their own LEDs, which would make finding them easier.The battery life is very poor, especially if you run the lights. I turned off all the lighting features to save power. If you're into mouse disco lights, expect it to work for less than a day. Big difference to my other mouse (which had 1 led) that lasts 2 years on 2 AA batteries! While I understand higher DPI, fast response mice with lots of LEDs take more power, this should be matched with a much larger battery, perhaps 5x the watt hour rating.While the razer claims to have a focusing optical sensor, I found it no better than any other optical sensor mouse. It absolutely will not track on glass (something my laser mouse does just fine on), and despite it's high DPI, is not as accurate as a laser mouse with lower DPI.  Something to consider when buying a higher end mouse.  Finding laser mice these days is difficult, because I think all the mice makers went to the lower cost optical sensors. Too bad, laser mice rock.It's not a Bluetooth mouse. It would be nice if it included this feature. Installing a dongle isn't always practical. Also, no bluetooth means the mouse is useless on mobile devices, such as a tablet computer.The Razer software is buggy, bloated, has UI issues, and requires you to sign in every time you reboot the software or computer. Seriously? do you really want to sign into your mouse software? That is crazy.  If you wish to use very basic functions, such as scroll left / right with scroll wheel, you'll need this software running (unfortunately). Is it spyware? I don't know, and I don't care. If someone wants to spy on my stupid video games, go for it. (hey, I broadcast them anyway). The software was crashing on my Window 10 PC several times a day, requiring going to the task manager, and \"end task\", then restarting the software.  While the mouse will work after the software has crashed, many of the basic features won't (such as the left/right scroll).  Sorry, unstable software affecting basic functionality on a mouse is a deal breaker. Bloatware and needing to \"sign in\" is nearly a deal breaker too.The buttons aren't too bad, but not the best. The special purpose buttons are all in awkward locations, especially the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel. All the buttons feel like a cheap commodity mouse, no precision and very \"clicky\". The scroll wheel could use some improvements, it's just too clunky, doesn't free spin unless you loosen the tensioner on the bottom, then spins too free. The wheel isn't nice, isn't fast, and is a junk. I do like the left/right scroll feature on the mouse wheel. Unfortunately, the Razer software must be running for that feature to work, and the software is unstable.The mouse tracks well, until it doesn't!  This too is a major deal breaker, and in fact after the mouse froze  more than a dozen times a day, typically for 3 to 10 seconds each, I stopped using it. Tracking issues with or without Razer's software, with or without the wired USB, and on multiple mouse pads I tried. Not reliable enough for even doing office work, and you could forget using it for games. Yes, the mouse was close to the wireless receiver at about 1 foot (300 mm). No, there was no other interfering devices. In fact I've never had wireless device issues on this computer in this room before.  I'm guessing the mouse freezing is due to buggy mouse firmware, or a marginal optical sensor (or both).  I've used 5 dollar optical mice that perform fine without tacking issues. Sorry, it was a no brainer as to if I should keep the high priced mouse or return it.  In fact even if I couldn't return it, I would still have never used it.  A mouse that freezes is unacceptable.The cable it shipped with is excellent, and allows recharge and use while connected. This cord is very flexible, and probably the best USB wire cord material I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, as I wrote, even when wired, the mouse still had tracking issues. There is also a design problem with the cable connector in the mouse because of the very narrow channel to reach the mouse USB connector. What kind of design is that? So, for all practical purposes the (nice) cable is proprietary. I consider this a problem, because the mouse needs recharging every few hours, meaning you'll always need that cable if you take the mouse elsewhere.  If you lose the cable, good luck charging your mouse.I'm so sorry, but I can't recommend this mouse. Beyond being unreliable, it's small, cheap feeling, not easy to charge on a standard USB cable and with it's very short battery life, it is just too expensive for what it is.  I went back to my old logitech mouse I bought 5 years ago. Those that have already bought a Razer, and can't return it, I recommend gifting it to a child. The size is perfect them, they'll love the pretty lights, and they won't know the difference when the mouse stops tracking...",
          "Operates as expected. Smooth movement and tons of features",
          "The mouse looks great! We have a lot of products from Razer in our home and this one did not disappoint. If you can find the option that includes the dock, I say go for that one, it really helps with battery life. The mouse is ergonomic and while I don't use it for work, its great for gaming. I leave it docked when not in use and the battery definitely lasts several hours for FPS and MMO gaming sessions.",
          "Came what I ordered but with a delay 3 days. Excellent seller. Product don\u2019t have any issue but for more than 6k dpi better to use with dongle 0 delays. Is working on all the surfaces. Sniper button on the left side is perfect for text copying text or 3D modelling.",
          "The mouse works. It's a perfectly fine mouse for gaming that I've experienced minimal issues with in the last 15 months of ownership. I don't play mmo's, so the macros are mostly useless to me, but I've yet to experience any software related issues and can say it has lasted longer than my Logitech mice (plural) have. That said, I need to talk about the dock.The dock is great when it works. At first I had zero issues charging. about 3 months in I started noticing it wasn't charging despite being on the dock. This has grown to be an increasingly common problem to the point where I have to very carefully position the mouse on the dock in just the right way to ensure it's charging. Once you know, it's easy, but it was a pain trying to narrow this down and is a major disappointment for an otherwise wonderful mouse.",
          "I love this mouse. Not anything bad to say. I purchased some grips that are on the line of sandpaper and helps alot",
          "It's too bad Razer decided to flat out lie about the battery life on this device.  It is otherwise an exceptional mouse, with great feel for those who like a larger mouse and a \"sticky\" grip.  Works great, but simply does not last.  I'm lucky if I get 7-8 hours of use from one charge.  Ideally, they could either make this a \"replaceable\" battery option like most mice or just be realistic about the battery life.One other point, regarding warranty/replacement.  I got this for a good price during the holiday sale 2022, and have discovered that Amazon will NOT let me \"replace/exchange\" the mouse.  My only option is to return and then buy a new one, at FULL price of course.  So, I tried Razer and found that they make you go through a whole lot of ridiculous hassle to repair/replace from their stock.  All in all, if you buy this highly overpriced mouse, you're stuck with it.",
          "I bought this \"like new\" and it was not like new, it was very/good. The right click button was loose, which from what I read is probably not the fault of the first user i.e. even new Basilisks reportedly sometimes have loose mouse buttons. Sure enough, I bought a new one for only $20 more than this used one, and it had a loose mouse button, so I am returning it. The side buttons also felt loose. The QA of these mice is questionable, but it is indeed the most ergonomic gaming mouse I've used. It fits my palm in the way I've been looking for but haven't been able to find in any other mouse. Everyone's hands are different so your experience may differ.",
          "I have been in contact with computers most of my life and have come to develop a love for the peripherals I use. Whether it be for school work (Architecture School), Actual work (Architect),  Gaming (Counter Strike Global Offensive), or just browsing the web. I use and have a mouse in my hand for most of my day. When looking for a new mouse to replace my veteran 5-year old Razer Oroboros I considered many options including mice from Corsair, Logitech, Steel Series, and of course Razer.  Being that Razer made such a beast of a mouse with the Oroboros, I put them before all other companies. I read all the reviews for the Razer Basilisk Ultimate and liked what I saw. Once I received the Razer Basilisk I was very pleased with how it felt in my hand. I know it is heavier than the Razer Viper Ultimate but I was still shocked at how light it felt. I think that the weight is balanced nicely, not too light to feel cheap but not too heavy to feel slow. This thing can be moved effortlessly around my mouse pad. After the first day of use, I was shocked that the battery didn't last anywhere near the 100 hours as promised by its specs. On the first day, I got at most 8 hours out of it, I barely made it to the end of that workday before I had to put it on the charging dock with 3 percent calling it a day. The second day after a full charge on the dock I was worried about not making it to the end of my workday due to the previous day. Although it did surprise me that it lasted a little longer on the second day until the present, it has been the same as the second day. By the end of the day, I will typically have 10-15 percent now. Granted that it is better than the 8-8.5 hours that I got the first day it hasn't been much better than that. So I'm thinking they are stating the 100 hours based off the mouse not having any led's on the mouse on and the polling rate set to 250, not 1000. When I use this mouse I don't want to have to sacrifice any performance when paying the price that it is. Maybe the mouse that I have received is defective and makes me wonder why I am buying defective razer products like they have no quality control on their products. but It works just well enough for me not to return it because it does take me till the end of my workday. Now If this was the only mouse that I had for work and leisure I would have to send this back because it just wouldn't be able to last with 8 hours of work and then 5 more hours of use at home for games. Another flaw with the design being the inability to replace the battery with ease. Just looking at it there is no access to the battery which must mean they are using a battery that isn't like a rechargeable double A battery or something of the sort. So if this battery ends up dying I will be stuck with the mouse being wired when I paid for the wireless feature. That's where I have to give this mouse a 3 out of 5 due to the fact that Razer promises 100 hours of battery but I don't get anywhere near that much and the inability to replace the battery if it is faulty. Maybe others are getting the full 100 hours and that sounds great but I got a mouse that struggles to last on wireless mode until the end of my workday (8 hours) which sounds pathetic to me.",
          "It\u2019s an amazing mouse I love what Razer did with this I had the older version for a while and when I swapped to this it was immediately better I don\u2019t have to deal with batteries the mouse works perfectly with the led software from Razer and even matches my keyboard",
          "\u00a0This mouse feels great, its responsive, accurate and has that RGB flare. I've gone through a few mouses over a year and a half and this one by far feels the best. My previous mouse was a Redragon m801 sniper pro and I thought that was good at the time, but when I switched to the Basilisk Ultimate the sensor felt almost weirdly responsive in a good way. This is my first Razer product and the presentation is spot on. Once I dialed in my dpi lighting and binding, I was off to play Apex legends.Starting with the ergonomics, it feels great after a couple weeks of adjustment. My ring and pinky felt most of the discomfort at the time since the previous mouse was so wide, but after the first two weeks i feel no discomfort with this mouse. The plastic body is very smooth, almost slippery at the top (Solve that with mouse grips). The optional paddle is nice and has a satisfying click. Speaking of clicking, what I'm used to is a solid click from the mouse 1 and 2, this one is a little soft than most mice I've used, but it's less loud too. The scroll wheel has some cool features with tilt and resistance adjustment. I also appreciate the preinstalled side grips, they work for me. My hand measurements are: 3 3/4in from thumb across and 7 1/2in from the middle and ring to my wrist.Battery Life is great, you can make it through a whole day no problem with the RGB on. I usually have it at 50% brightness so your millage may vary. Its a shame though that its NOT USB-C and still uses Micro B for the cable. The cable on the other hand is very light and you could use the mouse with cable without even noticing. It has a compartment for the wireless receiver and connection is flawless. No Bluetooth thought.The Lighting is another luxury of this mouse that Razer proves well. Some game have implemented lighting with the software, for example: Anything you interact with in Apex Legends gets a colored response on the mouse (The video showcases taking damage and a Phoenix Kit being used). The customization is expansive with the Razer software, you can change multiple areas of the mouse individually with effects. The only problem is without the software, the mouse saves everything but the lighting profile.Last, the build quality is mostly plastic. It's smooth and minimal and has appealing curves. The feet glide smoothly and has that premium material.Overall, it's one of the best in wireless mice out there with a premium price tag. Great if you can get it on sale. Would like to see a new version with USB-C thought. :/",
          "This mouse left a horrible first impression since it could not have bothered anyone to clean this before it arrived in my hands. I purchased this in very good condition from Amazon Warehouse. I would not be one to complain about a used product being like this but the fact that I payed $125 from Amazon I would expect this mouse to at least be clean. The mouse' onboard memory was evidently not cleared as the previous owners profiles were saved to the mouse. Had to factory reset this mouse. Disappointed in these aspects.MOUSE REVIEW:As anyone would expect this mouse is modeled after the G502 and that is not a bad thing. The ergonomic feel is great and anyone that has hailed to the G502 will give this mouse the same praise.The weight of the mouse is what would be considered \"mid-sized\". Weighing in at 107 grams and being wireless with this many features I was not be disappointed. I personally played on a deathadder elite prior to this mouse. It is only 2 grams lighter being a wired mouse. This weight shouldn't bother most people unless you are an avid FPS gamer.I also purchased this mouse for productivity. I am a Graduate student in Computer Science to give you an idea about my workflow. The scroll wheel feels great to scroll through documents and code at the lowest sensitivity. Super quite when you need it to be and super ratcheted if you need the feedback. The only complaint here is that there is no hyperscroll like on the G502.The lighting and battery life on this mouse has treated me well thus far. The mouse has always outlasted me in gaming sessions and plunking it onto the charging dock afterwards makes battery life a non issue. The lighting is pretty bright but it does suck out battery life quickly. The longest session I had on this mouse is 8 hours with 50% brightness with juice still left.For gaming this is a great mouse, the optomechanical switches feel and sound great. Fastest in the market technically as well. The sensor is good but disappoints me since there is only 1000Hz polling rate. A higher polling rate would be appreciated.TLDRFirst impression sucked given animal and human hair was taped or stuck to this product.Overall this mouse is great. Well worth the money imo for gaming and is only missing infinite scrolling for productivity. Get it with the dock if possible so you never have to worry about charging it. (The dock alone is $50, purchase it with the mouse.) Razer did a great job with this mouse.",
          "I was skeptical about paying 80$ for a mouse a friend strongly recommended razer products to me after I had several bad experiences with red dragon products ( most are over priced for the products performance )  then I came across the basilisk ultimate that advertised up to 100 hour battery life it's legit... I work at home on the computer and I game on the computer most of the time I' charged it as soon as I got it and then 6 days later I'm at 11% i charged it again it's been 3 days since my last charge still running strong very nice feel to it and I like the  download able software there's alot of things you can do with it . I also like they let you program all the buttons to your pleasing something red dragon cannot do... super happy with this purchase i would have paid 100$ for the mouse and still be happy .. they say it should last for 70 million clicks and the products with razer come with standerd 1 year warranty too.. I'm definitely looking forward to buying more gear from razer... unfortunately my keyboard my keyboard stopped working today so that might be happening soon love  your products razor !",
          "My old, trusted mouse began acting rather strangely. It would double click upon most, but not all, single clicks. I ignored this for a few weeks despite it being annoying. Then, a few days ago, the middle mouse button completely stopped working.I hadn't realized how dependent I was on middle-clicking stuff! A link I wanted to read? Middle-click so it opens in a new tab. Realize I wanted to see the last page again but not lose my current page? Middle-click on the back button to open that in a new tab. Decide to open a bookmarked page but don\u2019t want to lose the current page? I\u2019d middle-click on the bookmark to open that in a new tab.Realizing that I simply couldn\u2019t live like a savage any longer, I bought this new mouse and wow, what a huge improvement over a non-functional one. If you ever want to appreciate a product, use a broken piece of crap version for a few weeks. Let it slowly claw at your sanity for as long as you can manage. When you start gibbering and hallucinating, you\u2019re almost there. Continue to ignore it as the madness escalates into an attack on your core identity. Allow it to worm its way into your mind as it starts to make you doubt yourself on multiple levels. Let it get so bad that you start to dread the things you once loved.When the shadows that only you can see begin to whisper dark things and you actually start to think things like, \"Yes, the shadows make a good point. Why haven't I begun to plan a series of perfect murders yet?\" At that point, you are ready to replace the no doubt cursed item with a brand new version.The difference is amazing. The shadows not only recede, but the voices stop. You soon regain your sense of self and realize that you were not your mouse nor was your mouse you; no, you are a separate entity and you deserve to love yourself enough to rid not only yourself, but the world, of the cursed item that had been eroding your sanity.I feel like our prisons would have way less murderers if more people divested themselves of their cursed items and bought new ones sooner. Think not only of yourself, but the safety of your neighbors. Buy this mouse.",
          "The battery life is far better than the mouse that it replaced. It always connects as soon as my computer boots up. The speed and accuracy are excellent.",
          "I've been skeptical on buying a wireless mouse as my primary gaming mouse for years now. I finally broke down and decided to try this one, as a wireless mouse would be more ideal for my situation, and so far I'm glad I bought this.Connecting it with the Razer Synapse App was a breeze, and all of the lighting zones worked correctly from the start. The combinations of colors and effects you can have with the mouse (and the charging station) is really a great feature if you like having RGB lighting on your peripherals.The charging station, if you chose to buy that too, works really well. Placing the mouse onto the charger is quick and easy, and it looks nice next to the rest of the setup. Like I mentioned before, the charging station also has RGB options in the Synapse App, and can even let you know the mouses battery level with a light color while it's charging.The responsiveness, so far, has been great too. I haven't noticed a single drop in connection, or issue with the mouse lazer skipping at all. I've used the mouse on several surfaces (table, couch cushion, pillow, mousepad, carpet) and so far the lazer has been able to track the surface I'm using really well, if not perfectly. I'm actually impressed at how many places you're actually able to use this mouse on, without having to use a mousepad or something similar.Last but not least, the scroll wheel. The bottom of the mouse has small wheel you can spin up/down, that lets you adjust the sensitivity of the scroll wheel. You can have it click, with quite a bit of resistance. Or you can set it to be smooth, without any clicks at all. It's very satisfying, and depending on your situation (gaming, surfing the web) it can be very handy to switch between different settings on the fly, without any software needed)Out of the many Razer products I've owned throughout the years, this mouse is definitely one of my favorites.If you're looking for a solid wireless mouse, and like the multiple different RGB functions that Razer offers, look no further. So far I'm really impressed.",
          "I'm pretty sure that my physical device is defective, but the issues didn't really become clear until after the return period had passed. This mouse has an adjustable tensioner for the scroll which is great. Unfortunately for me, mine is problematic. Regardless of how tight or loose the tension I set, moving the mouse while gaming will cause the sensor for the scroll wheel to recognize and I am OFTEN changing weapons at the absolute worst times. Even by setting the tensioner at the highest level, I am still seeing regular scrolls being detected and causing weapon changes. I confirmed the issue is the scroll wheel by doing a test of thumb + 1 finger on the left and right side, no where near the scroll wheel, and moving the mouse around with occasionally picking it up a few inches to adjust as would occur in a game. Placing the mouse down softly caused the sensor to detect a scroll and the webpage I was on would scroll. Aside from this, the mouse is really good. The battery works well, though to get anywhere close to the 100 hours claimed you have to completely disable the LEDs, which really defeats the purpose of buying a nicer mouse. Even with the light level set to the lowest level, I saw 60-65 hour battery life, which was very unexpected it was that much of a hit for a minimal light level and no changing of the colors. If not for the scroll wheel hardware fault, I'd rate this between 4 and 4.5 stars. But with the physical unit I have, 3 stars is the best I can do.",
          "Great mouse, don't use it for gaming as I use a controller but it works perfect so far.",
          "Mouse has been great. I don't game so no feedback there, but every day use it is solid. Polychromatic(sp) Linux app works great. Can control rgb and mouse and shows battery level as well.",
          "This mouse\u2019s battery drains so quickly, but I realized I can turn off the lighting and the battery lasts so much longer. The only frustrating thing is that sometimes the lighting decides to come back on and I have to keep turning it off every now and then.I use this as an office mouse, sinai can\u2019t comment on how good it is for gaming. It seems to be very responsive when I use it.Another thing to consider is very rarely the mouse actually gets frozen on the screen and won\u2019t move. I\u2019ve found turning the mouse off and back on again fixes this.Overall I am happy with my purchase. It is very comfortable to use, the scrolling wheel is great, the ability to do continuous scroll in either direction is great.",
          "I bought this gaming mouse to replace my current cheap ergonomic mouse that I've had for a few years, as I'm slowly getting back into gaming again. How does it compare with my previous mouse? I wouldn't say that it completely blows it out of the water, but it definitely does do some damage. This is a lean beast of a mouse, built and made lean after decades of fighting in the gladiator pits. You can easily tell this mouse is corded and muscled, and well-trained for its true purpose. To be brandished as a masterful weapon, and bring glory and death to untold colorful pixels. Yeah, it's got a helluva job - you can't help but be envious of it.Sadly though, the ergonomic aspect has not seemed improved at all - or, at least, I don't notice a difference. Granted, the former was an ergonomic mice and it had kind of a wonky, \"unnatural\" design. But I can't honestly say that this is more ergonomic than the previous. It *is* slightly more noticeably sensitive and responsive to use  though. And it's got these cool buttons for all sort of control over it. Two dedicated macro keys for wrecking mayhem and finding the shortest path possible. But technically you can make it three, since the sensitivity clutch button wasn't overly useful to me (actually, I didn't really understand the point of it).Then there's the toggle buttons for adjusting the sensitivity. I default to using 1800 DPI. The other values are too fast for me. In fact I customized the sensitivity stages as I thought it was a little unrealistic (set the max as 4000 DPI on the last stage).The scroll wheel was a little hard for me with factory settings. I'd recommend adjusting the resistance wheel on the bottom to get the desired resistance from scrolling. Also, as I recently discovered, you can also *tilt* the scroll wheel if you're scrolling a lot, like say through an article online. Huh, that's nifty, I thought.Also, should mention that I bought this mouse over the Viper Ultimate. I would recommend you buy this over Viper if you're right-handed. It's ergonomic appeal would definitely tip the hat to it, I think.Charge: regarding battery life, me thinks it's ok. I just wish there was an easier way to check current battery health rather than going into the synapse app - maybe setting up a desktop notification when charge reaches <50% or so? I don't know, just spit-balling. There might be some settings for this somewhere, I'll have to have a look later. Right now, I would say the battery span is definitely not something I'm used to. I had a wireless ergonomic mouse previously, but that one was powered by two AA batteries, so I rarely needed to address any battery issues with that.Instructions for setting up mouse and charging dock:(Note, I thought i'd add this part here for reference, since originally I was a little confused myself as well. Hopefully this should help clarify things if anything was unclear, as the manual is not too useful)- Lift the tab from the underside of mouse to remove USB dongle, plug it into computer or into USB port on your keyboard if you have a pass-through port.- The included cable can also double as wired mode for the mouse, if you're low on battery, but it's unfortunate as that's also the one needed to connect the dock to power. Use the side labeled as 'TOP' facing north, and insert into dock or mouse. In case of mouse, attach other end to cable to PC; for dock, attach it to PC or any USB charging hub.-  It's easy to charge the mouse of the dock. Just place the mouse on the dock as you would on a rack - you can see the two holes on the underside of the mouse where the pins will fit into. The mouse should \"pulse\" colors green, orange, or red depending on the current battery level of the mouse.Overall, hope this helped. It's a great mouse, but I rated it down for the ergonomic and battery aspect of it. Still a solid contender for the leanest and meanest mouse, though.",
          "I love this mouse! I got my mom a matching mouse because I love it so much. It\u2019s such a great alternative to G502 if you\u2019re looking for something new to try out. In terms of comfort, the mouse is on the lighter side. Unlike the G502, there isn\u2019t a place to add in extra weights to control the heaviness/lightness of the mouse. In addition, like any device, after owning this mouse for over a year, I noticed the battery life has decreased slightly but overall, I\u2019m very satisfied!",
          "I have been a die-hard Razer fan since first purchasing the old Naga Epic in 2010 (before chroma was even a thing, the one with the three interchangeable right sides) and the 2009 Razer Megalodon. Both of these peripherals work great to this day. I replaced my old Naga Epic with the new Chroma in 2017, and in only 3 years found myself needing a replacement because that mouse was not build to as high a standard as my first Naga and was already acting up for over a year. I hate to say it but the Basilisk wasn't my first choice, I actually bought the Corsair Nightsword but returned it because I didn't like the hand feel.Backstory aside, I ended u; buying this mouse, because I wanted to believe buying the best from Razer would still give me the best mouse. And honestly, I believe that still seems to be the case. This mouse feels a lot more premium built than the standard Naga that I've used recently. The aerodynamics of the mouse are very nice and easy to transition to if you are coming from a different style mouse, the optional thumb paddle is perfectly position to be pretty much a third click (great for a keyboard button that's often used in any game, or a macro). Razer Synapse 3 is probably the best gaming software I've used, and this mouse has world of chroma and performance customization, which is a big plus too. And the charging dock is a cool way to recharge your mouse and have it be a gaming fashion piece on your desk, which in my opinion looks very nice when showing off your gaming setup. I love having absolutely zero wire drag, and I haven't experience any noticeable latency with it being wireless, which I know may be a concern for some. I have pretty much only positive things to say about this mouse.That being said, I simply cannot give this mouse a 5 star. Why you may ask? Because I am not a fan of trick marketing, which Razer is still at fault of doing. The mouse will not get you 100 hours of gaming, because I've never been able to get 100 hours out of a single charge. I know they say \"up to\", but even on really low visual settings, I could crank out 50 hours, at best. now, 50 usable hours is still great, but with the rgb turned on and using it on normal gaming, I find myself needing to charge it overnight every 3-4 days, if I game 8 hours in the day (so lets say, 25-30 hours of use time between charges). That definitely isn't bad in the world of gaming and batteries, but I would have appreciated these real world numbers reflected in the advertising.All in all, it is a solid feeling, premium looking and performing mouse that demands a premium to be paid, but it  has brought back that trust that Razer is just that good of a gaming company. I still use my first Naga at my work office, and I hope that this Basilisk Ultimate joins the club over the course of this decade.",
          "I am a LONG time user of Logitech mice and finally got tired with the change in quality, they seems to last about a year or two now.So my wife had tried this mouse and said she liked it. So, I tried one, then bough a second. (I have two computers on my desk - one Mac the other Windows.So far, I like the mouse. I think the buttons on the top to change DPI are redundant, it could be done in an app, since I don't do it often.The HIGH resolution is kind of a marketing gimmic, since if you set the resolution to max, then it moves very slowly and at low resolution it moves very fast. Mouse tracking speed I would always set via mouse control panel. But, anyway. the point is you pick the speed you want to track the mouse by changing the resolution. Or you can se the resolution to max and then adjust tracking speed in the mouse control panel.each to their own.I also got the charger, I find it very convienent, every day when I leave my desk I simply put the mouse on the charger and it will never need to be charged or batteries replaced.So, over all, I am very happy with the mouse. Now if it will last more than a year I will come back and update this. If not, then I will go back to the less expensive Logitech.",
          "I have owned a few wireless mice over the years, most recently an older Razer Naga, with mixed results. The battery life on most \u201cgaming\u201d mice I\u2019ve used before has been awful, and as I frequently forget to put mice back on their docks after 25 years of using wired mice, most of the time I\u2019d return to the mouse only to find it dead, plug it back into the cable, and just leave it in wired mode 98% of the time. But so far, this mouse has never once died on me, even with the lighting left on, and even when I forget it. The sleep function works, and with its surprisingly good active battery life, it is never dropped below 30% power.The sensitivity is freakishly high, and I\u2019m not really sure why anyone would need 20,000 DPI but it\u2019s there if you have a use case for it. I like that it has the ability to adjust the tension on the scroll wheel and can range from extremely smooth scrolling to snapping steps depending on preference. Probably my favorite feature thus far is the optional \u201cclutch\u201d button on the side, which I remapped to F13 and use now as my Push-To-Talk key in discord. I have always liked having PTT as mouse 4 or 5, but it is nice to now have a \u201cmouse 6\u201d of sorts that is well positioned and not otherwise dedicated to something else like window navigation.Despite the fact I am giving this mouse a 5/5, it has not been 100% without issue. The wireless would drop out frequently at first, and the mouse would stop responding completely until it was plugged in, or the hub was unplugged and replugged, at which point it would stop working again within minutes or hours. Other users suggested this was possibly a problem with the USB port going into \u201csleep\u201d mode, so I went and set every port I could find to never shut off, but to no avail. However, after trying a couple different USB ports, I found one that seemingly did not have this problem at all, and it has been fine ever since. As others have experienced this issue with this mouse, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that if you experience this problem, it might not actually be the mouse\u2019s fault, even if it seems to be especially vulnerable to it.Overall, I am quite happy with this mouse. It\u2019s on the expensive end to be sure, but it\u2019s the first wireless \u201cgaming mouse\u201d I\u2019ve used that actually functions as a wireless mouse for me.",
          "Pretty much no complaints except a few. They're very manipulative with their pricing. I got mine on a \"sale\" and it's $40 more than the price a month or so later. Oh, so it's originally $179.99 and you sell it for $139.99 but a month later it's $99.99. This is a $100 mouse.1) The middle mouse button makes a mechanical clicking noise every time you use it. Sounds uncomfortable and prevents the mouse from being silent.2) I wish the battery lasted 50%+ longer. The battery level isn't bad, still lasts a whole day, but it just seems to drain a bit too fast. Tried fiddling a bit with settings to make it last longer, but maybe I didn't do it right. Either way if it could just last like two days it'd be perfect. Sometimes it doesn't properly connect to the dock (suggest lightly pushing down until you see it charging) and you're stuck with a dead mouse in the morning. Not a fan having to charge it every single day either. Feel like it'll die sooner because of it. Turning the lights down to minimum does help a ton, but it still could be a better.3) The dock doesn't dock well. It's hard to get it to charge and it can come loose. It will even look like it's charging but won't... and if you move it to check it'll probably undock. There's been multiple times I thought it was charging and the next morning it was on red. Luckily it does charge fast... but I don't want to have to continually dock my mouse and undock it while using it to gain 2% increments. I also don't want to use my cheap plugged in mouse when I bought a $130+ mouse (which was overinflated) that has my custom DPI.",

          "Seriously. We all know software for products can be annoying at times, and razer can be as well, but if you really take your time to get to know the software, it rocks! After 38 years of using mice, this is by far, the best mouse I have ever used in every way. I have the headphones as well, all these guys products are built very well. I can not complain about one single thing. Absolutely the best mouse I have ever used. I'm sure there may, and I stress may, be better, but this one is the winner for me 100%. I want another one for my other gaming PC and will be getting it as soon as possible. Thank you razer for another awesome product, you made my week!",
          "One star removed because model without charger station is really only good if always wired.  Had I purchased with charger would say 5/5.  Plugging in the cable seemed like a good idea but in practice was a hassle unless you want to use this as wired-only.  With a charger it works great -- I leave it on the charger over night a couple times a week and it rarely goes below 50% charge.Have only used for 4 months but that has already out-lasted prior mouse.  Was a bit nervous about modest number of buttons but *really* wanted the thumb rest have not been disappointed.Since I already had synapse on my razer laptop using the razer mouse means one less piece of bloat-ware for button programming.",
          "I compared this mouse to the Steelseries Rival 3, Viper mini, Logitech G Pro, Logitech G502, Logitech G502 Lightspeed.This mouse wins for comfort and stability/precision for value. It's not the best looking, it's not the lightest, but it works the best for what you pay. Especially when you compare it to the newer V3 pro, which is $160 retail. Also, the cable is very good, one of the best I've ever used, so I keep it plugged in a lot of the time.Why I chose this mouse:1) Ergonomic fit. The thumb rest on the left side makes using this mouse so much better for both gaming and regular use. it's a must have.2) Weight. It's a nice Goldilocks option, at 107g. Lighter than the Logitech G502 (120 g), not as light as the Viper mini (61g) , Steelseries Rival 3 (77g) , Logitech G Pro (80g). Personally, I don't like ultralight mice because they don't feel stable. I like stability/precision for FPS, which the Basilisk Ultimate is the best for IMO.",
          "I've been using the Logitech G502 ever since I first got into PC gaming about 2 and a half years ago. Ever since, I've been a huge Logitech fanboy. But when the G502 Lightspeed was announced, I was intrigued. Yet, I found the idea of having a cable nearby at all times in order to charge the mouse unintuitive. Additionally, having to plug in the cable would be a hassle. If I truly wanted to go wireless, I would need a $100 mousepad which would charge my mouse wirelessly. Yet, with an extended mousepad, the additional mousepad seemed incommodious since I owuld have had to layer the two. With the mousepad, the total price would have been $250. All for the luxary of going wireless.So when I heard about the Basilisk Ultimate HyperSpeed by Razer, I became interested. I've always had a grudge with Razer mice in the past since the ones I did have were uncomfortable and broke easily (but to be fair, they were cheap and I didn't put utmost care into them.) However, after watching reviews online and looking more into the mouse, I decided to buy it. I have never regret that decision.Transitioning from the G502 to the Basilisk Hyperspeed was a breeze, since they both have a similar form-factor. The features that are included with this mouse are amazing. The charging dock is stylish enough to blend in with the rest of my setup, and only takes up one USB port since the wireless receiver for the mouse can be plugged in to the port directly on the dock, which is already plugged in to your PC. The feet of the mouse are 100% PTFE, meaning that they will glide with ease and will not hold you back when gaming. The scroll sensitivity adjustment located on the bottom of the mouse is also really nice, since you can adjust it to have a very pronounced tactile bump on each step when scrolling or a buttery smooth scroll with no bump whatsoever, and anywhere in between of course. Additionally, as soon as you plug the dock in to your PC, a message will pop up prompting you to download Razer Synapse, so there's no need to go looking online for software.Within Razer Synapse, there are many cool features you can take advantage of. The sensors on the bottom can be fine tuned to detect the liftoff distance between the mouse and the surface it is facing to your liking, both distancing from and towards the surface independently. The lighting on the mouse is also fantastic when using Chroma Studio built in to Synapse, which can let you control each of the 14 LED's individually, or be used in sync with various lighting effects. And don't worry about the lights draining your battery, since you are given the option to have the mouse turn off all lighting after a certain amount of time of idling with no input.The battery life on the mouse is nothing to scoff at. I typically only fully charge my mouse about once every week and a half, and I use my PC for about 6-10 hours daily. Also, this mouse charges quick, and a few minutes of charge and get you nearly an hour of use.There's a lot more to this mouse than meets the eye, and I know I didn't cover everything that this mouse can do. But, despite it's features, this mouse is extremely pricey. But if you're willing to spend a hefty price for a top tier mouse, then I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",
          "The wireless mouse is one of the best I've used. The battery life is great and the recharging time is very fast. There's a lot of customizability for the mouse dpi. There's also an interesting button included that slows the mouse dpi down when you press and hold it and then switches back to normal when you stop pressing it. The mouse also allows you to set the dpi with two buttons right under the scroll wheel. The only problem is that recharging while using it doesn't seem to be an option. The main option is a docking station, but there's also a micro USB port on the front. However none of my USB cables would fit in the space where the micro USB slot was. But, as long as you keep track of battery life and remember to recharge, having it turn off during a game won't be an issue.",
          "I wanted a decent gaming mouse that was a bit better than average, but not crazy expensive. I managed to pick up the mouse and charging dock combo for under $100. First impressions were very good. It's well made, battery seems to get about 20-30ish hours of use before it needs a charge, although I leave it on the dock when it's not in use so it's never an issue. I wanted something a bit larger than average to fit my hands (I wear an XL glove, for reference), and the reviews that made this claim were right on - it's basically the perfect size.Buttons are well placed and feel sturdy, and I love the adjustable wheel resistance to get it just the way you want. This is my first mouse with a thumb rest and I'll never go back. There's plenty of sensitivity there. The only time I feel more than 20,000DPI would be needed is if you're playing on a 85\" 4K monitor at full res, or you're expecting way too much from a upper-mid-range gaming mouse. This one edged out the Logitech G502 for me because of the sale price I was able to get, and the option of the charging dock.My only gripes with the hardware are the power \"stubs\" on the charging dock (takes a few wiggles to get the mouse to sit on it properly), and the micro-USB charging port on the mouse itself (it's molded so it will only take a cable with a proprietary molded pigtail). These aren't huge issues, although if the cable were to ever break, you'd need to buy that specific cable and not just any micro-USB. The dock also uses the same cable, and you only get one in the box. Although if you're using the dock, you'll probably never need the cable directly into the mouse.My only real complaints that make the thing annoying to use, or where features are lacking, is the software side. As other reviews have said, it uses software called Razer Central to control the custom lights and other configuration options. The lighting UI is actually pretty decent and there are quite a number of customization options. There are some things lacking that I wish it had. For example, you can configure the mouse and dock to pulse from red to green as the mouse charges, to indicate battery life. It's a cool feature. But what I would LOVE is for the dock light to be able to show the current battery status of the mouse while it's in use. I do believe it turns yellow at 20% battery life, though.The biggest issue for me though is the constant updates that it does. I feel like at least once every week or so, I'll turn on my computer and everything lags for a minute or two while Razer Central does yet another update. Then a little later it'll just randomly turn all the lights off and on again, as if Roy Trenneman himself had instructed it.Although I should say that I later paired this mouse with a Razer Cynosa Chroma keyboard, so it's not like this problem stopped me from buying another Razer product. They really should work on their software, though. When it comes time to replace this mouse, if the software has improved by then, I'll consider Razer again.",
          "i've had this mouse for a little over 6 months and these are my thoughts.The dock+dongle cannot be plugged into a USB Switcher unless its powered externally.The included micro-USB cable is the only cable that fits into the mouse since its keyed with a groove on the sides. Otherwise you have to jam a third-party cable in there and then use ridiculous force to get it out.The software has been a pleasant experience for me. I set the dock to show me the mouse's charge level.The dock's magnets don't help me at all in finding the right place to attach the mouse. I have to fiddle around with it and even after all this time it still takes me a few tries.Tracking has been wonderful -Mouse isn't too light or too heavy and even after hours of use my hand doesn't hurt.Coming from a wired G502, this mouse checked all the boxes for me. It's been good for productivity and gaming.At this price (I paid $120 for mouse+dock) I would definitely buy it again but if it was closer to the G502 I'd probably go with that since the PowerPlay Mat seems like a better charging solution if you have the desk space/aesthetic for it.",
          "This is a great mouse, but with one weakness: the scroll wheel.I have bought this mouse twice because I had to return the first one.  The first one I returned because the scroll wheel was intermittently responsive.  The second one (which I currently own), initially the wheel worked perfectly, but over time, it would also become intermittently responsive.  I believe the reason is its feature to adjust wheel resistance.  I suspect that mechanism introduces some unreliability with the wheel.Other flaws1)  The scroll wheel left and right tilt, by default, do not scroll left and right.  You need Razer synapse software to reprogram this.  This is incredibly odd.  So if you can't install Synapse (i.e. a work laptop), you won't be able to scroll left and right.2) You can only recharge the mouse with the micro USB cable that it came with.  Reason: The charging port has an oddly specific shape that makes other micro USB cables you already own not work.Pros: Great RGB, very slippery feet, very ergonomic, very responsive.Conclusion: I have two Razer Basilisk Hyperspeed X, one for office and one for game.  I rate the X 5 out of 5. These are inexpensive versions of the Ultimate and have none of the flaws I mentioned.  If RGB is not important, I say get the Hyperspeed X. Only if RGB is important, consider the Ultimate.",
          "I've been using this mouse for quite some time now, and I have to say that it never lets me down even once. Let's first talk about latency and wireless signal strength since that's most likely the concern for many folks when considering to migrate to wireless peripherals: they are as good as wired. I used to use Predator Cestus 500 (1,000 Hz polling), and I feel no difference in terms of latency or performance comparing the two. If you are still doubtful, I recommend watching LTT video where they teamed up with Slow-Mo Guys comparing the latency of wireless vs wired gaming mouse using high framerate camera. Keep in mind that I am also using WiFi for my PC as well as phone sitting next to it with Bluetooth connected to my PC. I've never had any weird interference due to multiple signal frequencies at all.Next, battery life. I am the type of person who spends a lot of time on PC, and COVID just extends my PC daily usage time by a significant margin. It's safe to say that I am using PC for 10 hours minimum and can be even longer. About a week ago, I tested of fully charging my mouse, and using it continuously without charging it ever. The result was amazing. I had two days of intensive use with about 30% battery juice left (5 minute RGB light timeout; 50% RGB brightness). Theoretically, if I were to be 'eco', that 30% juice should last for another 24 hours if things come to shove.Finally, the software. If you already have Razer peripherals (e.g. Keyboard, RGB hub, headphone, etc) that are controlled via the software, then there is zero concern at all for you. If this would be your first product and you are not planning on getting other Razer peripherals, then it would mean ONE ACTIVELY RUNNING software in the background. The software is necessary for initial setup as well as many other functionalities (e.g. lighting control, special programmed macro buttons, hypershift button, etc). You can theoretically get away by installing and uninstalling the software once you fully program the mouse thanks to onboard memory chip, however, you will not be able to control the lighting, launch programs or control lighting via mouse button, and a lot more. You will feel like you're missing a lot for $100 mouse.",
          "Now I haven't used all the top mice, but I did my product research before buying this mouse. It is now 2 years later and I've just bought a second one in addition to this purchase. My first mouse still works great with some minor hiccups (will detail below).In my current setup I now have 2 Baslisk Ultimate mice. The reason being: I now have two mice so when one needs to charge, I have the other sitting ready on the charger. And the best part is, the battery life isn't even a problem at all, it has some fantastic battery life. I go probably 2 weeks on a full charge. That being said, I specifically turned off the RGB lights to achieve this. The RGB lights do cut down on the battery life quite a bit, and I never look at my mouse and I really don't care to have RGB lights, I just really love this mouse (hence why I bought 2).As for the minor hiccups I mentioned earlier, there's really only been one. After some time, my mouse began to have some trouble charging on the dock. I found a forum post online talking about this and they recommended taking a Q-tip and dipping it in isopropyl alcohol and cleaning the charging contacts. I tried it, and it worked. I do have to clean it from time to time, but that is not a problem for me as I value the mouse very highly. I love this mouse because it is 1) wireless and 2) has a charging dock, so I don't have to fuss with plugging in a cable, I just set it down. I also love that 3) the dock can be set to turn specific colors indicating battery life.4) I am given the power of Hypershift which can be very powerful with a mouse. The way I primarily use it is: I set my Hypershift key to the trigger button on the mouse. Hypershift+left is bound to go back a page in my web browser, HS+right is forward a page, HS+left mouse wheel nudge moves me left a tab and HS+right mouse wheel moves me right a tab in the web browser. It makes web browsing such a fluid experience, no reaching for the tiny forward/backward button or wasting time moving your mouse there to begin with.Anyway I could go on and on with the ways this mouse is great. I haven't had any weird problems with it and it's lasted me 2 years and still going strong. I love it so much I bought a second one. I can't recommend it enough. And like I said, I haven't used other mice but there's literally no reason for me to look anywhere else. The only thing I can think of would be that I need to clean the charging dock, but that would probably be the case with anything that has wireless contacts. Heck, my Roomba has contacts that need cleaning (with the exact same method btw). I don't know if it's possible to design around that issue.Seriously I'm just trying to give praise to a product that is so perfect in my eyes it needs no further adjustments. Aside from Razer not selling the cable individually, in fact it doesn't even come with the dock if you buy it separately (BOOOOOO!!!!!) But if you have it plugged into the dock at all times, you'll never break it anyway. I recommend this mouse.",
          "Below was my original review. But just to keep my review updated, I ended up purchasing this mouse again.  I just can't stand the Logitech software.  I don't know if it was the placebo effect but I put in a good 4 hours on Apex the first night I had it (last night) and I had probably some of the best rounds I have had in both damage and wins.  I'll just learn to live without those 2 extra buttons on the G502.  Still gets 4 out of 5 stars for not having those buttons.This mouse was SOOOOOOO close to being perfect.  Coming from a G-502 (I own 4 of them for every computer I use), I really wanted to go Razer since they have really stepped their game up recently.  But ultimately I had to return it.Logitech decided to really mess everything up with their new G-Hub software (Oh I see you have tons of profiles from Logitech Gaming Software?  Would you like to import them?  Sure just let me just make it look like I imported them.)  Yes that was what happened to me.  G-Hub imported my profiles but didn't actually import ANY of my personalized mouse bindings, which I have yet to go though and set everything back up again.  Also for some reason it wasn't switching profiles automatically unless I manually added the .exe in the settings (a friend wasn't having that problem).So I got this, set up a custom config in Synapse for Apex Legends (super easy) and played for about 4 hours.  After 4 hours I had to pack it up and send it back.  Don't get me wrong, I loved how easy this mouse glided on my Razer Firefly V2, I loved how it felt in my hand, I loved the grippy and tactile scroll wheel, and I loved the button press feelings.Why am I sending it back if I loved it so much?  Because of 2 missing buttons.  I thought I could live without the G7 and G8 buttons that are on the G-502.  But after trying a few different button mapping configurations to compensate the missing buttons, I just could not find a viable solution.  I use those buttons a lot and just can not live without them.WHY RAZER?!? WHY!!!  You blatantly copied the G-502, you didn't even try to hide it, like a toddler with chocolate all over their face and hands telling you they didn't eat the candy.  You obviously made this mouse to get G-502 users to switch sides, yet you leave out 2 buttons that would have kept me using it.  This may not be a deal breaker to some people, and to those people BUY THIS MOUSE!!!  It is amazing, that is why I am giving it 4 stars.  If you relied heavily on the G7 and G8 buttons like I do, you may just want to stay with the G-502 line of mouses.",
          "I bought this mouse without really looking at the specs. I've become accustomed to peripherals just working with my MacBook Pro. So I was a little worried when it arrived and there was nothing in the guide that came with it about Mac compatibility. Nevertheless, it does work with Mac in a very basic way. Because the mouse requires a USB dongle to communicate with the laptop, you will need a USB-C to USB adapter. Plug that in, turn on the mouse, and the laptop recognizes it immediately. No driver installation or software installation necessary. You can change the cursor and scroll speed in the mouse settings in the Mac System Preferences. Most games have keybind settings, so you can associate any of the mouse buttons with whatever abilities you want in game. As best I can tell, the only thing drawback to using this device with a Mac is that there is no compatibility with the Razer Synapse or RGB software. Which means you can't customize the lighting effects or create mouse-click macros. This is an expensive mouse, so if you want full functionality, you will want to buy another one that is 100% Mac compatible (and Razer does not make such a device). However, if you are happy paying top dollar for an ergonomic mouse, this will work fine. The buttons are finely tuned and don't require a lot of pressure to click. The scroll wheel or middle-click button works very well. It's a beautiful device that changes color as you use it. You just can't customize the color scheme for particular games, that's all.",
          "Well, it's a G502 clone produced by Razer that can also go wireless. Better RGB though so it ties my setup pretty well together, but struggles with battery life, it's only good for maybe a few days before needing a recharge.Pros:- RGB profiling is saved to on-board memory, you won't need to change it every time it is plugged into a new PC.- Solid feel in the hand, especially for bigger hands.- Nice quality cable.- No double-clicking issues so far, about a year of daily use.Cons:- Charges using Micro-USB, blech. Not even USB-C?- Very poor battery life even with RGB off, maybe could get 2-3 days out of it before you need a recharge. 1-2 days with RGB.- Wacky implementation of the \"Hypershift\" button which can easily be knocked off during use. V3 version fixes this.- Build quality feels somehow inferior to the G502.Overall, if you are going to be mostly wired, this is not a bad option. But if you can wait a bit, save up the cash for a wireless G502, or a Lightspeed. The Glorious Model-O is another option but is only wired IIRC.",
          "Awesome price and good quality",
          "\u00a0Hello all. Here to drop a review for the Razer Basilisk Ultimate w/ Charging Dock. This baby was a pretty penny, so I\u2019ll run you through some of the features, pros and cons, to see if it lives up to the hefty price tag.Form factor is great. I\u2019m coming from a g502 with pretty big hands, and this mouse feels like an old friend. Construction is very nice and feels like a solid, durable mouse despite being noticeably lighter than its g502 counterpart. I swapped on the plastic flipper for the side clutch button and that feels remarkably more comfortable to reach than the g502\u2019s clutch. The adjustable scroll wheel is phenomenal and feels great at both tight and loose resistances, though it lacks the g502\u2019s infinite scroll.RGB is awesome. This mouse is a looker, and you can check out in my video what I was able to do with just some minor tinkering in Razer Chroma Studio. The software lets you customize lighting for both the mouse and the charging dock, and it\u2019s very intuitive and comes packed with impressive lighting options. I personally found the RGB on the mouse looks better to me on lower brightness (I felt it looked more \u201cdefined\u201d and less blurry, especially around the logo). That\u2019s perfect because it helps me conserve battery.The battery life was a little concerning, specifically the time to charge. Then someone recommended I update the firmware, which Razer Synapse (the Razer product management suite) does not do automatically. DO THIS. Battery life and charging time have both noticeably improved.The sensor and response are what you would expect from an almost $200 mouse. Smooth in games, easy to adjust dpi, and clicks are responsive.That said, I have had some hiccups. They would be forgettable, except that I paid a premium price for the mouse and that makes the hiccups a lot less endearing. Once in a while, the mouse seems to forget where it is. Over the course of the weekend this has happened two times, and really it just freezes for a second or two. That isn\u2019t all it forgets. It may be caused by me remapping there clutch to another keybinding, but the clutch button stopped working completely and had to be powered off and on to fix it. It also forgot my custom keybinding for middle mouse click and I had to input it again to fix it.I suspect these problems are less related to the mouse and more related to Razer Synapse. While the program doesn\u2019t feel buggy to use, it does seem to be the culprit of these \u201ccute quirks\u201d. Additionally, it caused the game Overwatch to close itself on launch until I removed the \u201cVisualizer\u201d app in Synapse. Not as \u201ccute\u201d. Synapse is why I can\u2019t give the mouse 5 stars. I hope they work out the kinks.Overall, the Basilisk Ultimate has still earned a recommendation as well as its hefty cost. I\u2019d definitely recommend it over the g502, with or without the charging dock; but man that dock is convenient (and pretty too). Get it!",

          "The simple things in life count, like having your mouse and keyboard cycle through colors together.  Supposedly this is the quiet keyboard, but it's pretty loud to me.  That's OK, I'm happy with it and even like the wrist rest it comes with.  I was afraid it would slide around but it stays put.You should know that the keys can be pretty sensitive at times.  I have to watch out for stray letters upon occasion.  Of course, this could be because the keyboard is not at an \"appropriate\" height.  It sits on top of the desk and not in the drawer/tray build into the desk.Overall, I'm very happy with the keyboard, though I am not using any of the macro functions at the moment.",
          "I've had the keyboard for 8 months. It's very comfy to use compared to some of my other keyboards. The keyboard usually works fine, but it has a few issues that make it irritating to use.Occasionally, a key will stay active as if I'm holding it down. This is annoying when I'm playing a game and fall over an edge while I'm parkouring, drive off the road in a racing game, or walk right in front of someone if I'm sneaking.Recently, the keyboard has also stopped registering an input occasionally. It doesn't usually happen while I'm gaming, more when I'm typing.The chroma lighting system is fun and making my own chroma makes my desktop a little more fun than just a generic light wave or rgb rainbow effect. It's also useful to have macros and rebound keys using the synapse application.I don't regret buying the keyboard, but I think I'll do a little more research next time.",

          "Love it! I bought it with yellow switches and may exchange it for the green since Im use to Tactile (brown) switches. But time will tell. The yellow may grow on me. I dont miss that loud clicky sound as a type at all. The green would return that sound. Yellow is best for FPS gamers btw",
          "This was purchased for my daughter and she loves it. The keyboard is bright, colorful, and works great.",
          "Another home run for razor yellow mechanical keyboard for those that do not like the loud keyboard klacks from the keys. If you like the loud key sounds buy the green mechanical black widow keyboard. Gaming or working you will want this.",
          "This keyboard works great, and looks very nice. the build quality is great, exactly what you expect for the price, I went for the green switches and they are great . The only issue is there is a known compatibility issue of this exact keyboard with windows 10 where the windows search bar bugs out whenever you restart your pc, and you have to unplug the keyboard and restart the pc again and then plug it after the pc is on . you can look this up, and apparently it is an issue with windows trying to update the keyboard drivers everytime it boots up, the only solution is to manually update the keyboard bios from razer's website, the problem is they don't have any support files or downloads available for this model in particular so you are pretty much stuck with this bug .",
          "Not loud clicky, but just enough to satisfy. This is for my work computer to which my office has a light that turns off after five minutes of no movement. With this keyboard I can still see what I\u2019m doing lol",
          "The wrist rest is a great addition - the older model of the keyboard was prone to rusting, so by leaning your wrists on the rest, your sweat won't mess up the keyboard.",
          "This feels very good, the quality is good and the keys are soft and silent.I am loving it.",
          "\u00a0So this keyboard is clicky and nice. Colors are nice. My fianc\u00e9 has a V2 (this being a V3) and mine has the media keys which are nice but they took to Aux and USB ports. They also took away the macro buttons....my biggest problem overall is the V2 came with a plush wrist pad. This one is \u201cErgonomic, Magnetic Wrist Rest: Made of plush leatherette to maximize comfort over extended gaming sessions\u201d.....or- plastic. It\u2019s literally plastic. Not magnetic, not even plastic all the through (it\u2019s hollow) with a leather \u201ctexture\u201d (like they just laid a thin stamp when it was being made) on the plastic. It\u2019s all one kind of plastic. Not even a fake pleather or anything. No cushion once so ever. So I\u2019m kinda let down by that also Amazon delivered it in the rain in the box with a shipping label smacked on it. If I had went to work 30 minutes earlier the entire thing would\u2019ve been soaked because it wasn\u2019t in the normal plastic shopping bad or an extra box. Not to mention I live in a college town so a lot of people would\u2019ve realized I had a nice in box keyboard just sitting right outside my house.",
          "I love this keyboard. Just don't get it if there are people around who are sensitive to lots of clicking.",
          "I got this gift for my husband. He loved it! The only thing i didnt like is that it was shipped without a box. They just put the label on. He uses it for work and the typing is loud. But other than that he loves it!",
          "It's not as well made as my old 2016 special edition razer keyboard. This one is much lighter and seems less structurally sound.  After some use thought it has out preformed my old keyboard and held up well to hours of gaming and work . I would buy again.",
          "Typing this from this keyboard as we speak. It's sturdy, clicky, and colorful. The keys are nice and sensitive so you don't need to pound the keyboard to get it to work. Amazing, will buy again",
          "Very clicky keyboard and fast response times for gaming.  Enabled gaming mode all the time and works great even in other apps like emails and Microsoft apps.  Took a few minutes to set up due to having to take it out of a display mode it's shipped in.  Look on line if you have issues.  Otherwise great lighting and works with Chroma.",
          "Overall, it's a solid keyboard but honestly, after close to two years of use, this keyboard feels like a bit of a downgrade compared to the BlackWidow V2 that I owned previously.I find myself missing the macro keys, which are now absent from the V3, when having to perform keyboard Twister to activate some of the more complicated shortcuts repeatedly.They also removed the USB ports which were so useful for plugging in my mouse and/or gamepad, or any other temporary usb device.Finally, whoever designed the volume control cylinder deserves to be fired for turning something that I didn't even think about with the previous version of the BlackWidow into an awkward nightmare.  It's just so badly placed that it forces you to tread carefully or risk hitting the keys on the numpad.  The wheel itself is works fine and its texture feels nice.  However, it's runined because you really can't roll it seamlessly since it's located way too close to the numpad keys that you have to reach over and will rub against your fingers as you use it.  And you have to press it in to activate mute/unmute, which is awkward because your fingers will keep turning the cylinder instead of you're not extra careful.  I find myself avoiding using what could have been easily resolved with a dedicated mute button.All in all, when a key on my V2 stopped functioning, I wish I would have looked into repairing it or ordering another one of the same model instead of treating myself to this newer V3 model.  It's feels and sounds nice like the V2, but its utility is hampered by some odd design choices that make it feel more like a downgrade without upside.",
          "Love the keys and the clicking though the family doesn't like it so much.  Only one thing disappointed me and it was the support that luckily you can put to the side.  It's hard and the cheaper razor keyboard I had came with a soft padded one however the keys weren't as nice or the color.  I love razor products but considering how much I spent I would think razor would have made the support padded not hard.  The keyboard itself is better than I expected.  I only bought this one so I could give my old one to my son who wanted my original one.",
          "This one is really beautiful. I have to say a bit loud when typing but I believe that like is mechanical then you can change the switches latter :). What I did not like and still do not like is the fact that the keyboard loses the configuration of lights a lot. You have to  restart the synapse at least 3 times at day. I work remotely so I use it to work too but when I go to eat or take a lot of time it just loses the configuration so this is something I consider they have to improve knowing that this one is not cheap. I mean I restart the program and then everything comes again back and works great for a long time but then it just stops working. I don't know if it is something I am not configuration in the synapse but I do not think this has any kind of timer... therefore 4/5 but still a pretty cute one specially because of the synapse.",
          "Overall, I love typing and playing games on this keyboard, it gets the job done! If you\u2019re a casual gamer this will be good enough and is satisfying to type and do homework with. Only thing you will notice is the back space feels cheap and is by far the loudest key for some weird reason.For enthusiasts, the space bar isn\u2019t the greatest, it\u2019s just average. A little rattle, but had a nice, firm press that you can actually feel when actuate. Bunny hopping in FPS games is no problem. With the RGB, it\u2019s fairly weak, and you expect more for paying for something over $100. The razor software is on the lower tier of RGB software and is he brightness is dim compared to even $50 keyboards. Not a big issue for me, so I won\u2019t knock it too much. The silent keys aren\u2019t silent, but they give off enough sound to feel satisfying and the feedback is OUTSTANDING! When you press a key, you can feel the switch, it\u2019s hard to explain but it gives enough feedback so you know when the key is pressed it feels \u201cheavy\u201d then light again after actuation. After little time it becomes subconscious feedback that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re using, it\u2019s great, by far the best keyboard I had for gaming and schoolwork. I\u2019m a coder so it\u2019s nice having the not so noises keys and satisfying feel. It\u2019s really hard to explain in a description, but if you\u2019re worried on how the yellow switches feel, don\u2019t be. Other than that everything else is solid, nothing fantastic. Keyboard has some bend, volume controls wheel is nice (kind of don\u2019t like the location tho would still prefer the function key) and the software is good enough for shortcuts. I also like how you can disable the windows key while gaming, little nice feature. Arm rest is okay, I have an L shaped desk so the middle kinda floats and I still don\u2019t have slipping issues like others were saying. It doesn\u2019t help that much, it\u2019s just nicer to feel than the desk and having your wrists elevated is more important imo. Overall very solid, would give 5 stars if it went above and beyond. However, the keys are above and beyond and that\u2019s what matters most",
          "This keyboard feels pretty good and sounds phenomenal. The keys are pretty sensitive and activate with very little movement so only get this keyboard if you have a light touch. I find myself accidentally hitting keys while gaming often. If you do get this keyboard, buy a replacement wrist rest because the one that comes with this keyboard is awful. It slips, is cheap plastic and doesn't have a magnet so it does not conform well to the keyboard; it moves all over the place. It's also thin which is really bad for this keyboard because its keys are really high up.",
          "This is my 3rd Razer mechanical keyboard. I had the original black widow and also have the v3 clicky at home. I bought this one for work since clicky keys would be too loud.The first thing I noticed with the yellow switches was just how sensitive they are to pressure. The clicky keys take some force to push down and that is a good and bad thing depending on your preference. My major problem was I tend to rest my fingers on the keys at work. This would cause random keys to be pressed. The solution is to just not rest your fingers. It took some getting used to but about a week in I saw less accidentally key activation. I think the yellow keys make you type faster but I still like my green keyboard since I know when the key is pressed.Adding to this point, I think razer should make a \"brown\" tactile but silent version of the black widow. I think the only one they offer is the compact version without the number and rest pads. I don't understand why they can't add that option to the full keyboard since they obviously designed and have the key in stock.If you are wondering how loud the keys are, that depends on how hard you hit the keys. I tend to push all the way down so even the yellow silent keys make some noise. But since they are linear, you can press halfway and they key will still activate.The razer mechanical keyboards are definitely the best imo. I've looked around but razer seems to be the only one that has the custom built wrist pad. I also like the scroll wheel and the build quality. A lot of the other mechanical keyboards have name brand cherry MX switches but then cheap out on the outer material or add weird stuff like a USB passthrough???",
          "I've had my eye on this keyboard for years, and I absolutely love it. It gives me the clicky, tactile feedback I love when working on my computer, and it matches my office! The colors are so pretty, and because I have a Razer computer as well, I can play with the settings and lighting on the keyboard, which is so much fun. I'm very happy I finally took the plunge and got this keyboard.",
          "The chroma effects are the main reason that I bought this keyboard and I was not disappointed there. I feel like Razer could learn a little from some of the options included in Corsair's iCUE lighting profile, like layers for example, but overall I'm more satisfied with Razer and Synapse.The clicky green switches are a joy to type on and I love the sound they make. They are very loud though and will definitely get picked up by your mic.I wish it had USB passthrough slots on it to plug a mouse or USB stick into and some dedicated macro buttons would have been nice. The rolling media bar feels largely useless and it's too out of the way for easy use as a macro controller. I'm also not a fan of the detached plastic wrist rest. The plastic doesn't feel very premium and I'd really prefer if it had a way to attach to the keyboard.",
          "I am quite happy with how the keyboard works for gaming. The sound of the clicking from the keyboard when I type or use it to walk around and use my abilities in games is very pleasant to my ears. I would definitely recommend. However, I wish the colors of the keyboard was a little brighter in color, but that does not change my overall rating and happiness with the purchase. Whenever this keyboard breaks due to wear and tear, I really hope I will be able to buy another one if they are still available.",
          "Got this keyboard for work. Way better than the original keyboard I had. It\u2019s super tactile and clicky and really comfortable. I don\u2019t love the wrist rest though as it\u2019s just some plastic that butts up to the keyboard.",

We wanted to get the 3 set together but it was so hard to find this keyboard; it was sold out locally & online every we looked or it was overpriced. This seller had a great price, shipping was fantastic & it was packaged very carefully. I recommend this seller #1!",
          "I bought this for my grandson for his birthday. hes a very serious gammer and he loves his keyboard. it is easy to use and fun. we recomend it for everyone. Its worth the money.",
          "This is a solid board with decent features. I got it on a sale over the holidays-but the keys feel cheap, and overall the keyboard has too much plastic.The silent switches are pretty silent-though Cherry MX silent definitely feels better.If it's on a sale, it might be worth a buy, but it just wasn't for me.",
          "I finally treated myself to a Razer keyboard after using my son's over the years. I bought this strictly for use in the office and it has made my days doing payroll so much more fun! Aside from being eye-catching, the mechanical keys are great for knowing that yes, I did enter a digit without constantly looking at my screen. And let's face it, typing 75wpm sounds frickin awesome on this keyboard!! The included wrist support works as well as anything I've used and provides a well-angled rest for 8+ hour days.Pros: Eye-catching color changing, easy to set up, comfortable to use for long periods of time.Cons: It's loud. Your every keystroke will be heard across the room. Half of my coworkers have mechanical keyboards and it's not a silent office, so I knew it wouldn't be a big deal there, but at my previous employer people would have lost their minds.Who I am: 41F, business professional, geek.",
          "So... I purchased this one to see the difference between  mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards. First thing I noticed is that the input latency is significantly lesser than with my old membrane keybboard (it was a low quyality one though) and the keycaps feel SO GOOD to use.I'm using signal RGB to sync everything together and it just looks so nice. If it ever gets to a sale just get it, you will have no regrets.",
          "dont really have any complaints other than the palm pad is solid vs padded other than that was a great buy",
          "I love the clicky sounds. You can switch out with custom keycaps too.",
          "I usually don't care much about wrist wrests. They're the least important part of a new keyboard for me and usually end up in the closet unused. But when the one I get is so clearly NOT what is described in the product listing, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. This is NOT leatherette, it's hard plastic. It's also not magnetic, I've confirmed this with strong magnets that hold on to this about as well as any other non-magnetic piece of plastic.The quality control on this keyboard is also kind of shoddy. 4 keys were off when I opened the keyboard, and the seem along the front of the keyboard, where the logo is, is very uneven. I don't see this hurting the performance in any way, but for a keyboard purchased purely for its looks, it should be put together well.The keyboard itself is alright. It does what it says on the tin, can't knock it there. It's a quality mechanical keyboard. But for the price, I'd have liked to see a bit more. Maybe a row of dedicated macro keys or a USB passthrough, stuff present on other offerings of around the same price. Because while I love the color, pink isn't a feature. So just be aware that you're trading possible functionality for aesthetic. Though, to be fair, I knew all of this going in, and hopefully so do you.",
          "I haven't owned it for very long, but I think it feels nice. Feels nice for typing, I haven't used it that much for gaming yet, but it felt nice and responsive when I used it in a limited sense. I already updated the firmware, so I haven't experienced the double typing issues others had but I would probably recommend doing that.I'm writing this review immediately just to let other people know that the wrist rest isn't plush or very ergonomic, and definitely isn't magnetic. It's just a hard plastic wrist rest that doesn't attach to the keyboard at all. Which I guess is nice since you can go out and buy a wrist rest that's more comfortable instead. I guess the hard plastic wrist rest might be a plus for some people, but in that case why not mention it in the product description? I'm not going to return the keyboard or anything, but it's frustrating, and just in case this would be frustrating to anyone else, here you go.The product listing also mentions usb 2.0 passthrough somewhere on the page, because I guess they just copied it from the blackwidow elite and didn't edit the page very carefully.",
          "The keyboard is super amazing, however I am very upset that my keyboard did not contain a code in it for the in game add on.EDIT: I contacted Razer Support to resolve the issue with me not receiving the code and they resolved it within a day. The keyboard is still amazing and very customizable along with its mouse and mousepad counterparts!",
          "I have the Blackwidow Elite Pro v3 for my gaming setup and love it. It feels really solid and sturdy and doesn't slide around on my desktop.As soon as I picked the keyboard up from the packaging, I knew I was going to return it. It feels cheap and flimsy. I got this keyboard as my full time work keyboard and just hated how it felt and how rough the key texture was, while the keys feel hollow and cheap. The left shift key was really stiff compared to my other keyboard.The worst offense though is the 'wrist pad'. It's NOT a pad or soft at all like the other wrist pad that came with the blackwidow elite pro v3.  It's an angled piece of hollow, cheap-feeling plastic that isn't ergonomic or comfortable to me at all. It also doesn't have that nice strong magnetic hold that the other keyboard has.It all in all just feels like a knock off. I expected a lot more build quality for $100.",
          "I love the feel and click I get from this keyboard, I highly dislike the wrist rest it comes with. I upgraded from an Ornata V2 with the wrist rest, and though the wear and tear on it got pretty bad I highly liked the padded wrist rest. The wrist rest for this makes my wrist really sweaty and irritated, I wish they would've put back the padding as it was much more comfortable and gave a lift that aligned my wrist to the keyboard",
          "I got the yellow switches which are apparently quieter than the green ones. There is still a soothing clickety-clack noise. Overall, the key board just feels good. It is genuinely a joy typing on it. I am told there are more affordable mechanical gaming keyboards that are of comparable quality. That may be so, but I have no regrets getting this amazing product.",
          "Love it works as it should",
          "This key board works and looks as advertised",
          "I use my gaming keyboard for my personal computer. I love the beautiful lights and the different ways I am able to make the lights flash . I also love the easy feel of the keys. I feel I am able to type faster because of the way the keys are made.",
          "Replaced an older black widow.  Love the new chroma options (my previous one was Razer green backlighting only).  The new design is much better for keeping the keyboard clean.  Solid metal base.  Keys feel great.  Opted for the yellow linear and very happy with the feel.",
          "I do like the clacky-ness of this Razer keyboard, this is the 3rd Razer keyboard I've owned.  The multi-media button and roller are a unique idea, mostly i use it for PC volume adjustment and it works great for that.The wrist rest is just a plastic wedge that doesn't really connect to the keyboard in any way .  I at least expected a bit of padding on it but there is none, it's literally a plastic wedge you slide up next to the keyboard.The LED lighting on this keyboard is not very bright, i have the brightness at 100 and it's much duller than my other two keyboards.  On the other hand my other two keyboards had a bit of a frame around the grouping of keys. This one is open, the keys sit atop the base there's no frame maybe this causes diffused lighting.Anyway it's fine it works.  I don't LOVE it but it does what it needs to.  And i have to say.. the lighting configuration stuff has become stupidly complicated now i just want my keyboard to light up green and there is a ridiculous amount of steps to go through to do that.  Lighting was so much easier in Synapse 1.  Honestly i wish i could just buy a keyboard with green lights like they used to come with back in BlackWidow 1 days instead of having ot futz with all this chroma complexity now.",
          "I honestly love Razer products. The ergonomic wrist thing this comes with is awesome because it's not attached to the keyboard - so you can move it around freely or decide when you do or don't want to use it. The key sounds are also like ASMR. Very clicky I love it. The backlight colors to the keys are such a nice vibe for my late night gaming, and easy to customize with the synapse software from Razer. 10/10.",
          "Just bought the keyboard works good for the price, i like it better than my previous corsair cherry mx brown switches, this keyboard is a little more responsive and quiet."

Plug into more than one PC and you are stuck with the default, especially on a work computer where you can't install Razer software. Could the default not just be Razer green or at least more than one color option built into the firmware?

          "Bought this as a replacement while I find a day to fix up my Corsair K95.Overall from my experience it is not a bad board for people who like Membrane boards that are looking for a mechanical feel. However, going from a fully mechanical keyboard to a mechamembrane is quite \"interesting.It is very odd to type on even while typing this review. There is WAY more resistance than I originally expected when giving it a shot while typing and especially gaming. I mean you have to be really heavy handed and I mean you gotta be the type of person who loves to slap the crap out of your keys to even feel remotely comfortable typing on this board. A lot of this review is mostly my opinion on how my experience went with the Ornata but here some things to know if you are looking to get this board.Again you have to be really heavy handed to enjoy using this keyboard.The Razer Software is not as bad as people are making it out to be, it' pretty easy to use and I have not ever had any issues with using their software in the past.The wrist rest that the board comes with is actually really comfortable and I initially thought that the magnet that snaps itself to the keyboard was gonna be to weak to hold onto the the board itself and was wrong, it stays in place and doesn't move.The RGB lighting that Razer uses is probably the most vibrant RGB lighting out of all of the other vendors lightingand that's saying a lot for me since I pretty much only use Corsair peripherals and hardware.Overall, this is a good starter keyboard for anyone who wants a nice flashy keyboard that performs pretty damn well and is a good pick for people who don't want to buy a fully mechanical keyboard, just be aware if you are looking for a keyboard that has little resistance and don't want to break the bank, the corsair k70 is probs the way to go.",
          "I've had a pretty good experience with Razer products in general, so I decided to upgrade from my old Razer keyboard (Anansi), to the new Ornata Chroma which was on sale. Of course the big selling feature with the Ornata Chroma is that the keyboard uses a \"mecha membrane\" key system. When each key is pressed down, the feeling is similar to that of a clicky mechanical keyboard. Typing feels much better compared to my old membrane keyboard. And since it uses a membrane instead of individual mechanical keys, the price is kept down.LightingThe main reason why I bought this keyboard was for the illuminated keys. The keys appear to \"float\" over the RGB lighting giving it a really cool look. The actual keys themselves have their letters lit - but the font size is rather thin, so the lighting through letters can appear a bit dim compared to other competing keyboards. Still, the keys are readily readible in the dark - which works for me.TypingI really like the feel of the typing with this keyboard. I didnt' want to spend the money for a real mechanical keyboard with RBG lighting (like the Black Window or the Huntsman), so this suits me nicely. All the keys feel great when I type long emails or documents.GamingI've played mainly FPS games and MMO's with this keyboard and it feels really comfortable. Other than the sticky issue (see below), gaming with this keyboard is good.Razer customer service helping with problemsInitially I had no problems with the Ornata Chroma. I liked it so much I ended up with three of them - one for my home PC, another for my office PC, and lastly one for a family member. However, after a week 1 of the 3 keyboards started having sticky keys. I would press down on some keys and they would not return back up after the initial keystroke. This didn't happen that often, but it was very annoying when it did. Thankfully this only plagued one of the keyboards- the other two were just fine.  I tired to fix the issue myself by cleaning the key swtches, but eventually the keys would still stick down. I ended contacting Razer's customer service. Although I had to send the keyboard back to them via Fedex (they provided the paid shipping box), the customer service was very smooth - all during a holiday break - which was quite unexpected. They literally responded to every email I sent within 1 day, and usually it was with an actual person addressing my needs specifically. The unit I received back was a brand new Ornata Chroma and it works perfectly.ConclusionIn the end, I feel that my experience with this keyboard's sticky keys is rare occurance - due to all the positive reviews that I've seen.  And if you do have any issues, I'd say that their customer service will definitely take care of you. The Ornata Chroma is a really good deal for the feel of mechanical keyboard, response of a gaming keyboard, and the fully customizable lighting that Razer provides.",

          "Keys feel absolutely amazing as I'm writing this. Don't really care about the colors but if you do it lights up and you can customize it, I guess. But relating to build quality, key feels, and the added wrist pad... This is amazing. Best feature Imo is the wrist pad, you will need a hard surface to use it though. It will slide off if you use this keyboard on your lap. I superglued it to the keyboard and this worked for me. The wrist pad I cannot really describe how perfect it is. Buy this, now.",

          "- Current Thoughts - ***UPDATE - (7/20/2017) My replacement product arrived. Eureka! This one had no issues with the super-squeaky keys, and all of the keys make sound. Interesting differences : this one is much quieter than the first one sent (so much so that I'm almost feeling like this one is defective - it barely makes more sound than my built-in laptop keyboard), also with the long keys that have a metal support, the bar is located on the side of the key that is harder to see. ***- Previous Thoughts - (7/18/2017) I have discovered that my Enter key on the Numberpad does not click AT ALL. I am quite distressed. Really, guys. For how much this keyboard cost, you send me a NON-CLICKY-BUTTON. I'm sure the melodrama will eventually pass, but I'm giving Razer a chance to reply to my review before I begin to storm the castle, flame rising in the back of my throat over a non-clicky-clicky keyboard. I shan't call it clicky if it isn't truly 100% clicky. //dragon-noises//- Original Thoughts - (7/17/17)-- Pretty darn happy with it. The clicky is so satisfying, but it doesn't hurt the fingers.- General Opinion -- Keyboard layout itself is decent, well spaced. I like the illuminated bar that indicates Caps Lock/Number Lock/et cetera. Pretty colors, although a bit more vibrant than I'd imagined. The keys with a metal support were so squeaky at first, it was incredibly annoying. Seriously, bad enough that I strongly considered returning the product. Seems to have improved over time, though. I do like that there are three avenues for the cable to pass through without inhibiting function. Love the wrist-rest. My computer is an old fogey that won't let me run Synapse, so once I get the new computer I can provide an updated review including that.- Design Notes -- The symbols keys are transposed (ie instead of / being the top part of the respective key, and ? being the bottom, they're swapped). Not too much of an issue if you don't watch your fingers when you type, but I can imagine it could get very confusing otherwise.  --  A few of the keys I have do not fully align to the keyboard - they aren't precisely parallel to the keyboard and don't fall in a straight line like the other keys do. This doesn't seem to impact function, but annoys the living hell out of me.For me, these are Space Bar and Enter.  -- Lighting on some keys doesn't shine through like the others, definitely wish that was improved. For me, the keys with less light are Backspace, - (numpad), Shift (both sides), Enter, and the top half of the ~/` key.  -- The braided power cable is alright. Already started to fray where I try to put it into the slot to keep it in place (which doesn't really work - it comes right back out). I would have used a stronger nylon-based thread.  -- The feet used to prop up the keyboard don't have the rubber grips that the keyboard and wrist-pad have.- Usage -- I use this for work and school, so it's getting used probably 12 hours a day. My hands definitely feel a lot better using this.- Usage Issues -- Super squeaky keys at first, seems to improve with wear. I was afraid to WD-40 them, but strongly considered it.- *** Update to Usage Issues - Enter key on Numberpad is click-less. The key itself seems defective, the little metal bracket on the right side will not stay in the little housing below. I managed to push it back in, but when I hit the key, the bracket rises up as the key returns to normal position. Interesting note, this was the key that was most obnoxiously squeaky when I first got it. So squeaky I avoided touching the key entirely until tonight, when I realized the squeaks were cries for help.***",
          "For synchronizing lights, your best off to stay within their ecosystem but that gets pricy. Product works great though. Just be aware.",
          "I can only compare it with blue switch keyboards: It is a loud, precise click that might be for some, but it can get annoying for people that type a lot. I've only had the keyboard for a day or two, but sometimes it bothers me to hear so much clicking when I'm typing a long text in the middle of a quiet night with headphones that aren't really much isolating.Otherwise? Razer Synapse software is A1, RGB effects are on point, best feeling on a membrane keyboard you're ever going to get, and I got it for a good price too at 30 USD.Should've also included the shipping weight, because the box weighs 4.8 lbs instead of the 2.1 that the standalone keyboard weighs (important to know if you're getting it shipped to another country).",
          "I had been experiencing issues with previous keyboards. It was a combination of key height being a bit high, along with inaccuracies when I was typing. Of course, many of the culprits were membrane keyboards. Naturally I was looking at mechanical keyboards by Corsair and others along with Razer. I fell in love with the Razer Mamba mouse and knew their products were top tier. I realized that for the $60 price point, Razer packs one heck of a punch. After watching numerous video reviews online, most of who were actually bashing the whole membrane/tactile combination, for whatever reason I still had a hunch that Razer wouldn't just put a 'hybrid mechanical' product on the market without it being pretty well r&d'd and taken to the next level in comparison to 'other' attempts. At the risk of it being a waste and the 'hybrid mechanical' rumors being true and ending up needing to go into the tier of true mechanical keyboards, I gave this keyboard a shot. I can wholeheartedly say my hunch was dead on. In a word: Smooth. This thing types butter smooth and accurate. The clicks are actually pleasant to the ear, my words per minute got a boost and I'm more accurate as well. I could not be more happy. The RGB is ridiculously good looking in person, and while I wish there were a more firm surface for the wrist rest(read: a higher quality foam or a plastic, either one), it is quite comfortable and unlike some reviews claim, it does not get hot under my wrists at all. Don't pass on this keyboard, because for under $100, this thing slays the competition, even costing a bit more, IMO. By far my favorite 'thing' about this keyboard is how Razer seemed to perfectly balance making a membrane keyboard that is hyper accurate, while giving it the 'click' many of us like in high end mechanical keyboards while making that click even more pleasant than what we are used to, while getting the key height and travel distance, well, perfect. I don't think the combination of these features is any accident. They seem to shake hands with each other quite nicely to put it lightly . All in all, if you're wondering if you need to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a 'real' mechanical keyboard, I can honestly say, I don't think you do. Give the Ornata a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
          "The mecha membrane switches just feel so good. I've been to bestbuy and microcenter and tickled every keyboard they had, I personally find this to be my favorite, even over the beloved cherry reds. The build quality is good, the rgb looks nice, and the volume wheel on the keyboard is easier to use than the icon in the taskbar. Glad the wrist rest is removable, I didnt care for it, but its included for thoose who enjoy them. Everyone of my friends that have test drove it loved it. Highly recommended.",
          "This keyboard works really well if you like the tactile feel of a mechanical keyboard but aren't really keen on the extreme noise that they tend to come with. It still has a nice click but it's comfortable in volume. It's not super thunky/clunky/awkward, and I enjoy it. Space bar could use some work (spacebar rattle is a common issue) but you can probably DIY a fix for that if you care enough to. Works fine for my needs! My partner has been using one for a couple of years and I've been a fan from the sidelines, so it's nice to have my own now. Plus, RGB! Fun!I did notice my \"A\" key was silent when I bought this, but I was able to fix this by taking the key out and putting it back a couple of times. I think the switch just got jostled in transit or something, it works fine now. :)",
          "The keyboard itself is of a great quality and much quieter than traditional mechanical keyboards. If you're not somebody that cares exactly what kind of colored switch the keyboard has and what those colored switches do, and you just want a neat keyboard that's good for gaming, then this is a solid choice. The wrist rest stays attached to the keyboard by some weak magnets, and surprisingly doesn't move unless you're really trying to get it to. In other words, it slides off easy when you're trying to slide it off, but it stays on and doesn't move when you're not trying to.Before I built my new computer I was mostly used to a membrane style keyboard, and at the time of building I bought a cheap mechanical keyboard (the Redragon Kumara w/ no backlights), but over the past couple months I was thinking I should get a keyboard that lights up so I can see it while playing games in the dark, quieter typing/playing, and has a number pad, so this was a perfect fit that wasn't overtly expensive. On top of that, based on my preference and frequent use of a membrane keyboard before getting the new keyboard, this one feels so much better and familiar than the mechanical keyboard I was using before. I also had a strange problem while playing games like CSGO where I accidentally would hit the Windows key when trying to crouch or the tilde key (which opens the console) while switching weapons (to the point where I outright took those keys off). This hasn't happened at all with this keyboard, but that probably has more to do with my familiarity with membrane keyboards by comparison than a problem with my previous keyboard.However, the reason I didn't give this five stars in spite of all the good things I feel for this keyboard, is because of the Razer Synapse software you're supposed to use with it. I've read on other reviews that the keyboard lights will stop working briefly or they'll lose their custom settings because of this software, and I figured it couldn't be that bad. But as it turns out, it can be that bad, over the past couple days I've had this keyboard I've had the lights stop working occasionally and sometimes during those occurrences my keyboard won't accept input, and I can only imagine that has something to do with the software the keyboard runs with rather than something with my computer or the keyboard itself (considering that it's brand new).Yesterday afternoon I booted up my computer to see that my keyboard lights weren't reflecting my settings, so I opened the software to see if I could access or remake them, but I couldn't actually find the menu I was using the day before to set them, and it was almost as if the software wasn't recognizing the keyboard anymore. The program never prompted me for any updates, and I even checked manually in the settings, so I figured I should probably just uninstall it and install a different version. But after going into the Apps and Features menu and accessing the program's interface to uninstall it, it says in bold letters \"UPDATE AVAILABLE\", so I clicked that instead of uninstall and after applying the update, my keyboard settings were loaded immediately.That aside, I felt that creating the custom settings was a bit of a hassle and strangely vague, so it quickly became a headache to use. About an hour after I managed to set the keyboard lights how I wanted, except for the fact that I couldn't apply any lights to the arrow keys, no matter what effects I tried or how I tried them, I just couldn't get any settings to apply to them, so as it stands they're the only unlit part of my keyboard. There's also some applications on Razer's website to integrate the keyboard with Discord or games like CounterStrike and Overwatch, or you can even play Snake on your keyboard if you're that bored.Overall, this is worth a buy if you want a good hybrid keyboard for a decent price, but the Razer software can be a bit of a pain to deal with.Also, if anybody's wondering whether or not this would fit on an extended mouse/desk pad, this keyboard fits perfectly on the\u00a0",

          "It is the keyboard I ordered but it\u2019s also not\u2026 technically.What arrived is the all star bundle version. If you don\u2019t know what the all star bundle is is it was a bundle that Costco offered, I believe, and it included this keyboard as well some other peripherals for a cheaper price than buying them separately. The only difference that I know of between the all star bundle version and the normal version is the box and the sticker or the back of the keyboard. Doesn\u2019t sound that bad considering how cheap I got the keyboard but I wish it was more clear that you were buying that version.I know it\u2019s a bit nitpicky but it bothers me now that when I open Razer synapse it displays the key board as an all star bundle Ornata key board because the register code for the all star bundle items are different than the normal ones.So basically what this seller did is buy up all star bundles and re sell the items individually which is a bit annoying to me.But it\u2019s still a good keyboard and I really enjoy using it.",

          "I really wanted to like this thing, and yet as I type this I am on a different board from the same company, as I replaced it soon after the purchase. Which begs the question, why am I rating it so highly? Well, lemme explain.First off, I wanna point out how Razer products are indeed premium and still high quality at the end of the day. There has been this bad rap going around that, \"Razer isn't what it used to be,\" and that all the stuff they have made in the last decade or so is crap. Completely untrue, the Ornata V2 was a prime example of that. Even though I personally didn't like it, doesn't mean there was no effort put into it.Secondly, another complaint I was generally seeing online when shopping for this was, people extremely disliked its companion software, Razer Synapse. I wanna just say to those people, they are whining unnecessarily and sound like petulant children, pardon my French. Their claims that it's too resource heavy make little sense to me, I watched a review on a similar product where someone claimed that the 700mb install file, that uses about 200mb of RAM for processing, was too much for them to condone using it beyond the initial set up stage. And all I have to say to them is, \"Oooowwwaaaaah, cry some more. Get a bigger hard drive and some more RAM man.\" If in 2022 you are worried about that small a file taking up that little system resources, then you need to reprioritize your life. Also, it's not hard to use at all, it has a good UI, it makes sense, I was able to get the settings I wanted in less time than it took to cook my morning breakfast. But I digress.Now that the preamble is out of the way, the device review:I can honestly say, despite it not being my cup of tea, it will be for someone. It uses a hybrid switch system which boils down to there being a membrane that actually actuates the key presses, and there is a mechanical \"switch,\" of sorts that makes a light click, and has some tactility that allows you to feel when the keys are pressed. I put switch in quotes, because it's not a traditional switch. Since that would mean it has it's own housing and springs to help actuate the key, and it would have a cross shaped hole in the keys to fit into a standard peg, but it doesn't. It has a plastic stem traditionally seen on older membrane boards, and when depressed, it causes a mechanism in the side of each key well to fire, making the distinct click, so it's quite weird in comparison to other keyboards of similar make. For example, SteelSeries has the Apex 5 which has hybrid switches that are similar to this and make the same claims, but actually have true switches instead. The result is, you get a tactile click, which I enjoy, and each press is bottomed out into a soft membrane, but since the click mechanism creates a friction drag on each press, it causes the keys to require more force to press than you might expect, or want them to. I had a few moments when I was typing on it when my keystrokes weren't being registered because I didn't use enough force to actuate them. This made touch typing a lot tougher than it should be. Which was a shame, because when everything went right, the typing experience was great. However, gaming is another story. Since the keys need more force to press, finger fatigue was a real issue. I would be playing an FPS game and simply pressing W to move forward for a few minutes made my fingers tired after a bit. I have carpal tunnel and using them like this becomes hard after an hour or two. So if you suffer from the same problems, then this might be a hard pass.On to build quality, it's very sturdy with little board flex, despite being an all plastic construction. It's big and chunky like a retro board, which I personally enjoy the look of, and the mid-profile keys are great since it's height is more than I am used to, shrinking it's profile a bit. Which the included wrist rest helps elevate the hands while typing making ergonomics pretty good since it's at just the right height. It goes on magnetically, and I had zero issues with it staying on during typing or gameplay, and if you have a desk pad that can fit it, it's simple to move and reposition the thing, as it's rubber feet are many and keep it from sliding itself. The top plastics have a matte finish with a light texture on it, and the keys have a layer of matte, rubber feeling coating as well, that unfortunately gets the grease off your fingers a bit too well, but is easy to clean in that regard. The RGB on the board is probably the nicest I have seen in a long time. It has a milky plastic backplane under the membranes that diffuses light excellently, and makes things like the sound visualizer in Synapse look great, very bright lights and a multitude of options make it one of the best in my opinion. Combined with the Razer Goliathus pad, which is the bundle I got here, it makes a wonderful light show and elevates the space a lot.All that said, I can't really recommend this except for a specific sub-set of keyboard enthusiasts. If you are not a fan of 100% mechanical switches and like the feel of membranes, but enjoy a light click when you type, this is great. But for someone who has typed on and used mechanical switches and knows how nice those feel, like myself, it's hard to come back to a membrane board like this. Again, it's not a bad experience, just not what I was looking for, so in the end I imagine this is someone's perfect board, just not my perfect board.That probably belongs to the Huntsman Elite I ordered soon after this one...",
          "I've been using it for a long time and had some problems. When I clicked Ctrl, the Windows key was clicked at the same time. Had the same problem with Tab key. When I clicked the Tab button, Q was clicked at the same time. I disabled Tab and Windows keys for a while from the program. After a long time, the problem fixed itself when I activated it again. I'd better buy a full mechanical keyboard. But that's good. I haven't had any other problems in general.",
          "This is a great keyboard it is my fav and will continue to be my fav. It's clacky but not overly so and the keys have a great feel to them. The wrist rest is soft and comfortable and the lighting is just a neat plus.",
          "The feel of this keyboard has spoiled me. Don\u2019t want any other style. Unfortunately I use it at work all day and I.T. at my company will absolutely not let me download any software to change the lights. That being said, i will still use it. It\u2019s worth the comfort. I just wish I could get rid of the light setting it\u2019s on. I don\u2019t even have the option to keep it on one color, it\u2019s constantly changing.",
          "Nice wrist rest",
          "The keyboard has a soft touch feeling. The clicking sound is not loud. Very nice one!",
          "exelente si me funciono",
          "It's a good keyboard, but know what you're getting yourself into when buying this.Firstly, the keys aren't mechanical; they're membrane with a bit of harder actuation when pressing down. This means they have a squishy bottom-out and are simply harder to press.The software, while bothersome, does alright with lighting the keyboard. While it IS per-key RGB, the software's RGB doesn't really match eye values, especially for the reds and yellows. It also doesn't help that the keybed is white, which makes the colors meld together and difficult to distinguish between different colored keys.The wristwrest is good. It's magnetically attached to the keyboard, and is really comfortable.The scroll wheel is hard plastic, and doesn't have a lot of resistance when scrolling (I can barely feel the notches in the ratchet when I spin the wheel, which isn't all that great in my opinion). A nice little plus is that it does click (by default mutes the device sound).Under the keyboard, there are routing lines to either side or through the front, which is really handy for cable management. There are also little flip-down feet for 2 different angles (6 and 9 degrees, respectively).There aren't any extra USB ports/audio jacks on this keyboard.Personally, I found this keyboard to be rather difficult to type on at first, but I've grown somewhat comfortable over time with using it. That's not to say that it's a great keyboard for its keys; they're subpar at best and I've had some trouble adjusting to them. I just liked the small, key-sized scroll wheel, and it got the job done for what I needed it for \u2014 casual, everyday use.",
          "\u00a0I bought this keyboard in May 15, 2020 and just a week ago 10/23/2022 the resting pad started to tear and it\u2019s already been such a long time. It went thru hardcore gaming in my hands and just started to rip. But the keyboard itself did not have any problems at all. All the keys work and the lighting is as good as it was when I purchased it. Highly recommended keyboard. Hope this helps!",
          "I love love this keyboard. I am personally am team logitech, the only thing not Logitech from my set up is the Razer Keyboard. I love the hybrid keys, still some clicky'ness but not too much. The wrist pad is a game changer as well. I use this keyboard for both work and gaming. I have used this for around 1 year and have had no technical issues. I do have a little wear n tear on the wrist pad, but I'm probably to be blame and not the design.",
          "\u00a0So...I have had this out of the box now for about an hour. I have played around with the Razer Synapse software. I have played a bit of World of Warcraft, and now I am writing this review with the Razer Ornata Chroma. Before this I was using a Steelseries Apex that was new in 2014...I can't remember if it was the Pro or not...but this is just to give you an idea of what I am switching from.They keys themselves feel very similar. You won't get a loud \"Clicky\" noise of an actual mechanical keyboard...but you definitely have more of a press of the buttons than just a regular office keyboard. I don't actually like \"Mechanical\" keyboards for gaming. Call me weird...but I really enjoy this type of hybrid. Part of that may be that many nights my wife goes to sleep hours before I do...and the constant clacking of a mechanical would keep her awake. But this one...while it does have a bit of a sound to each press...is not nearly as loud.The media function keys (F1-F7+ the fn button) all work perfectly. I tried them out with Youtube, but I would have preferred dedicated media keys for the price point...but it's not a deal breaker and I will just have to learn to adapt from my previous keyboard that had them included.The Razer Synapse software comes with a bunch of pre-set filters for the RGB lighting function, but it is also HIGHLY customizable...allowing you to add layer upon layer...even singling out just a single key, such as having the \"Fire\" filter as a baseline, and adding specific lighting effects if you press W,A,S,D or whatever key you choose.Overall...this was definitely worth the price so far. I can not speak to the durability of they keyboard, as I literally just unpacked and installed it a little while ago...but as the attached video shows, I am thoroughly enjoying it so far!5/5 on Day 1.",
          "Great keyboard overall.Keys:The keys are spaced a little more than other keyboard I've owned. Keys feel great and responsive.Noise:This keyboard is not quiet. I would say it's probably mid-range as far as sound volume. I've owned louder keyboards. I would certainly not call this a quiet keyboard.Colors:Great colors, and super helpful to have that backlight when doing tasks at night in the dark.Hand support pad:At first I didn't think I would need that pad, but now that I have it, it is great! Love it.",

          "Firstly, this is a  mecha-membrane keyboard and the experience of typing on it is very close typing to a real mechanical keyboard. It has a crisp mx blue style click and tactility due to the leaf on the plastic housing of each key well but with a cushioned (although some may call it mushy) bottom out due to the rubber dome style actuation.The quality of the board is fairly nice and sturdy and doesn't have too much flex. The keycaps are of the same quality and are in a standard font and are clean and readable although the size of the lettering is a bit smaller than the standard size.The wrist rest that this came with is very nice and an extremely nice accessory as the leather (although plastic) and the cushioning (although light) make it fairly comfortable to type on. And you can reuse it for other keyboards that don't have a wrist rest as I have been doing.The RGB is bright, vibrant, and very fun and easy to customize with Razer Synapse.Overall, for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't purchase this keyboard. The 100 dollar price tag is only really because of the Razer branding as this is really a $50 to $70 keyboard.If you want a mechanical keyboard, get a Keychron. For cheaper, such as when this thing is once in a blue moon on sale for 30 dollars, get an IlLovBee61. But if this keyboard is on sale, if you're really into Razer, and want a keyboard with nice and customizable RGB, then this keyboard is for you.(just between you and me: honestly bruh, I bought and KEPT this keyboard because of the wrist rest.)(also if you get the ILovBee, a secret to making the keyboard even better than it already is is to put some extra foam or filler in the case and put a few layers of tape on the bottom of the PCB. To make the keyboard even more better lube the switches or even betterer yet, buy some nice pre-lubed switches and you got yourself a mighty fine keyboard. I'd look up how to mod a mechanical keyboard and change out and lube switches before all of this of course though.)",
          "Top half of this review is an overall performance overview. Bottom half is an update about quality control and slow replacement issues that made me change this from a 4- to a 3-star review.I didn't purchase this keyboard for gaming, just straight typing. I work in transcription and have many of the same problems gamers do. I type faster when the keyboard gives me the right tactile feedback, it can't be too loud, the key spacing needs to be on-point, and even ghosting is a problem. The Ornata is one of the best keyboards I've ever used and has noticeably increased my productivity.Key Feel: I'm a heavy-handed typist, meaning membrane is generally easier for me to use. However, I love a good click. Having a 'tickity-tack' sensation with depression helps me stay 'in the zone' while I type. When I'm not working, I type fastest on my Macbook Pro keyboard. Macbook keyboards are a sort of membrane/mechanical hybrid like the Ornata, which is the biggest reason I went with it. You get that 'click' while still having gentler touch. The Ornata has a more aggressive 'click' than a Macbook keyboard, but it's still that hybrid sensation.Key Height: The Ornata advertises itself as a mid-profile key on the Razer website (I don't know why all the professional reviews call it 'low profile'; it definitely isn't even by gaming keyboard standards). I liked that idea. With low-profile keys (and especially full-on chiclets), it can be too easy to hit multiple keys at once when typing at max speed. However, the keys on the Ornata 'float' above the profile of the keyboard base. The end effect definitely isn't as dramatic as high profile keys, but it's still on the higher side. I expected something shorter. Key height can play a big role in hand fatigue, especially if you're a heavy-handed typist. If they set the keys even a little bit into the base of the keyboard, or make them just a touch shorter, it would be closer to 'mid-profile.' The trade-off you get for this key seating is easier cleaning (see Cleaning down below).Anti-Ghosting: When typing quickly, I often have a problem where I'm hitting the next key in a sequence before my finger has fully \"disengaged\" the previous key. On every other keyboard I've ever used, this means ghosting. I'd get 'thes' instead of 'these' and so forth. The Ornata prevents that, and it significantly improves my work efficiency. I spend less time correcting the 'thes' and 'tht' and 'thoug's I normally have to deal with.Key Volume: I'd rate this as a mid-volume key. It's much quieter 15-year-old, 'out of the box' desktop mechanicals that pretty much go \"THUMPITY-WHACKITY,\" but it's nowhere near as quiet as my Macbook. I can still transcribe without the key volume making it hard to hear my files, but a friend of mine who works on the phone noted that their customers would absolutely be able to hear their typing. To me, the volume is too loud for a hybrid key. It seems like it's making an effort to make a sound. I think that's what bugs me the most about it. It's inorganic; it doesn't feel 'native' to the key feel. If it was even the same volume but less sharp of a sound, it would be great. If you're looking for a 'stealthy' keyboard, this definitely isn't it.Programability: TBA. I haven't messed with this yet, but I use a number of macros while I work. I'll update this review after I've fiddled with it. The one thing I will say is that the keyboard updates are a mild annoyance. Your keyboard will stop working until you restart your computer, which I found out the hard way.As an aside, the Synapse software frequently leaves a lot to be desired. I'm on the beta for the new version. It works better, but the \"upgraded\" main interface is enormous, slow loading, and ugly. Lots of negative space for no good reason. It also lacks the customization capabilities you would expect. Everything about the keyboard is customizable, but you can't customize the interface to only show the options you use. The Chroma (color-change) customization screen is still awkward to use, though it works much, much better than it used to.Color & Color Programming: Phenomenal. The color is just icing for me, but it makes my work day a lot more interesting. It's rich and lovely with a good color-to-color shift. There are a few problems with programming it. The first is that the software needs work, though the beta of the new Synapse works much better than the old one. I still have problems with the keyboard abruptly resetting the color cycle to default after updates.Cleaning: Someone asked a question about this and made me realize this keyboard is absurdly easy to clean. I have dogs that shed nonstop; fur tends to build up between keys in other keyboards. Because of the 'floating' set and spacing of the keys, I don't get as much fur between the keys, and what does get in is a cinch to get out. I can tease pretty much anything that falls between the keys out with just a napkin or my nails. It would be effortless to clean up with canned air or just a paintbrush. Even if something was stuck to the membrane, you could dampen a Q-tip or a stiff paintbrush and get it right off.Overall, definitely recommend for heavy-handed typists that have a need for speed and accuracy. I knocked off a star for it overcompensating on the click loudness and the keys being taller than they should be for true 'mid-height.'UPDATE, reduced from 4 to 3 stars:After having the keyboard for about eight months, the LEDs started glitching out. Razer customer service personnel is fantastic; I've dealt with them twice now, and they're great. I sent my original keyboard back to Razer for a replacement. I appreciated free shipping both ways, but it was ground. It took almost a month between shipping it to them and getting my replacement.Six months after I received my replacement, the black coating is starting to wear off the center of my space bar. I have a .5 inch section where it's totally worn off an a 2 inch section where it has a heavy gloss from wearing down and is about to wear off. I had a shoddy laptop keyboard's coating last a good five years longer than this. The weird thing is that this didn't even happen on my last Ornata after six months of an equal amount of use.I contacted Razer customer service. I got prompt, professional replies, and the agent checked with a particular department about my issue. Unfortunately, this is considered normal 'wear and tear,' and my warranty is considered to be from my original purchase date.Razer does offer replacement key caps, but they were out of stock when I contacted customer service.You'd think a gaming keyboard would have key coatings tough enough to withstand heavy, rapid key press abuse. Just six months is pretty pathetic. This could be a quality control flub, but if so, the Ornata definitely has QC issues; this  marks the second time something has gone wrong with a brand new Ornata within less than a year.If this were a $30 keyboard, I wouldn't care so much. But you can't have a $100 MSRP on a keyboard and have quality issues like this, let alone replacement shipping that's as slow as it is.",
          "Good keyboard, very bright and pretty loud. I've had it for around 2 days now and I found some damage in the material used to cover the shift key. Pretty lousy in my opinion but it is what it is.",
          "This keyboard far exceeded my expectations on both comfort and key action. The keys are a bit louder than I\u2019m used to, but this is also my first keyboard specifically designed for gaming. I feel like it is a great value and would definitely purchase it again.",
          "I love this keyboard. I got this back on my birthday in July. I wanted to give myself some time with it before I reviewed it.1) The wrist rest is amazing! I had a just regular wrist rest before I got this keyboard and the fact that I never have to worry about it sliding around is amazing, but it's also just plain comfortable.2) Just a little side note here but... thank you razer for keeping long back space keys. THANK....YOU! No one wants a short backspace button, no one.3) This is my first time with a keyboard where I can customize the RGB and WOW! Do I love it. It's not necessary by any means but it's a lot of fun to customize it every once in a while. The RGB is also pretty bright and you can see the light through the keys. So plenty easy to use in the dark if you are a night gamer like myself.4) This is subjective, but none the less. I can type with ease on this myself. There isn't much resistance and so I can type with it and game with it all day and it doesn't exhaust my fingers at all.5) The click isn't super loud to me, but it is still very satisfying to listen to.6) The keys are hard to remove which for me is a plus. I had to take my keys off the other day because I spilled a bit of soda on it and my space bar got sticky as all hell. I was actually a bit worried I would break something when I was removing the keys. This is such a plus for me because it means that I don't have to worry about keys coming loose. I have had keyboard that with time the keys came a little loose and becoming wobbly. I don't feel like that is a concern with this board. That being said, putting the keys BACK in was the easiest thing once I cleaned all the keys.Overall I love this keyboard. It's the best one I've ever had and I've had a lot of keyboards. I just don't have any memory of having a keyboard that I enjoyed using as much as this one. WELL worth the price to me. Which is also saying something for how frugal I generally am. Along with the best keyboard, this is the most expensive one I have ever had and I don't regret it for a second.",
          "It is a loud, precise click that might be for some, but it can get annoying for people that type a lot. I've only had the keyboard for a month now, but sometimes it bothers me to hear so much clicking when I'm typing at night and just trying to get some work done",

          "\u00a0I've used this keyboard for the past 3 or so years. A couple months after getting it, I got sick of the loud clicking sounds\u2014the metal clickers they've put inside these are rather obnoxious.  If you want the keys to feel and sound much smoother, follow the steps below. I've included a before/after noise comparison. Aside from the noise, my only real gripes are (1) the atrocious Razer software that seems to receive meaningless updates every couple days, and (2) the included wrist rest, which will eventually wear out and start tearing after some heavy use. The keyboard itself, however, still looks great, feels great, and is very customizable.1. Get a pair of precision pliers and a keycap remover (or just use your fingers like I did, although beware it does hurt quite a bit)2. Pull the keycaps off the keys you want to be quieter.3. Carefully go in with the pliers and lift the the metal clicker bit forward and out from its resting place, trying not to crush or bend it with the pliers.4. Put the keycaps back on, and I guess save the metal clickers if you decide you want them back in.This works for every key on the keyboard, including the spacebar and all the other longer keys like Shift, Enter, and Backspace (although you may or may not want to take out the metal \"bar\" that spreads pressure evenly across these longer keycaps, depending on your preference).",

          "This thing was made for me, I love just about everything this keyboard has to offer(with one or two exceptions, hence the 4 star rating.)I've been using this for over a month now, and it's honestly become my favorite keyboard. Rubber dome keyboards get way too much flack, It's always been my preferred method for gaming, as rubber domes are basically the same thing as traditional controller buttons, and I don't see any of these mechanical keyboard nerds soldering MX Blue switches onto their Xbox controllers if they love them so damn much. A fair criticism that's made however is this keyboard's price, it is quite steep taking into consideration that rubber dome boards are usually very cheap both to make and to purchase, but at the end of the day, Razer is a luxury brand, and luxury always comes at a price, BUT, you wouldn't even be looking at Razer products if you weren't willing to spend the extra money on luxury.Simply put, it feels like perfection, looks sleek and sexy, has a comfortable as hell MAGNETIC wrist wrest so none of that screwing it on crap or having it just sit there and wobble around and it is so plush and comfy if my wrists could speak they'd say what they just typed.Now the only issue(s) I have with this gift from the chroma gods, is synapse (and also the pegs to prop the keyboard up don't have any rubber grip, and it angles in a way that the rubber on the bottom is no longer making much contact so if you prop it up it slides around with minimal force so why even include them????)Razer, you've gone and made literal cancer into a borderline spyware computer program that I have to install to use any of your products. What this program needs to change the color of your keys is beyond ridiculous: first you need internet access, and then need to register and make a Razer account and sign in which means you agree that they can basically do whatever they want with your information submitted and that the program is actively collecting TO CHANGE THE COLORS, COLORS. I'm pretty hyped for the day Synapse4 drops and requires a valid SSN and acknowledging that various accounts or loans may or may not be opened and taken out in your name just to turn on caps lock.I'm literally taking an entire star off just because of Synapse, it's just that bad. Half the time the damn thing doesn't even work properly, put the computer in sleep mode and oops nobody bothered to put any onboard memory profiles so your keyboard is back to stock settings until you re-launch synapse and wait 5 minutes for it to finish chugging along cause it's too busy documenting and monitoring everything else you do and god forbid it actually just work.",

I always thought the noise of a clickykeyboard would annoy me having ALWAYS lived softkey life. But I am loving this keyboard. I play apex competitively and the audible click is starting to sync up properly with my thoughts on movement. I was doing insane maneuvers and ditching a team of 3 my hands gave out before my peripherals. The reactiveness of my movement is changing to the clicks. I realize mistakes on hand placement faster. Because I hear click and something DOESNT happen im like wtf and realize I am misplaced faster, that type of correction is CRUCIAL in moments of competitive play. ALL HAIL MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS.I have seen the light, and its bright.",
          "I already have this key board it went on sale the price was to good so I buy another because the one I have still works great. But I have but it through some work so just incase a back up. I have had it for years. I did take it out of the box to make sure it works.",
          "To some people good and membrane don't go together but for me, I prefer to have a membrane keyboard.  Out of the box each key has these little clips which from what I can tell only exist to make noise.  I guess to make you feel like it was more mechanical than it was.  I removed them though.  The wrist rest is very plush all be it little over half a year later it is starting to peel up being made out of some artificial leather material.  It is comfortable but I wish they chose a different material on this front.What I don't like is Razer's insistence that you use, and download their software.  You tell it you don't want to download, it downloads anyway.  You tell it you don't want it to open on startup, it does anyway.  You unplug your keyboard for whatever reason and it opens or prompts you to install it again.  I want literally nothing in your software.",
          "For a long time, I've always loved Razer. I've heard a lot of feedback from my friends about the Ornata V2, mainly about it being great for gaming. I thought I may as well try it out myself, and I can't stop using it! I've went through many different mechanical keyboards, membrane keyboards, but this is my first mechanical feel keyboard I opted in for. The package includes:- Razer stickers- Setup guide- The included Wrist Rest- The keyboardI don't see how someone could hate the mechanical feel switches the keyboard offers. I've always played with mechanical switches (MX blues and Reds) and thought this keyboard was awesome because it offers the feel of a mechanical keyboard, but the soft cushion of a membrane keyboard. I feel like this is a great combo. I do know that you can remove the tactile bump on the keyboard to make it quieter, but I personally really like the feel of the bump. I definitely feel like the price of the keyboard is pretty hefty, especially for a membrane keyboard. So to that, I would say to get it on sale. They keyboard can be fully customized in terms of lighting, and key binding via Razer Synapse 3. I especially love the Hypershift option, bringing an entirely new set of keys to the keyboard once the Hypershift key is held down. You can set any key to do anything you really want them to do. Open a specific program, open a URL to a website, change lighting, the list goes on. They especially come useful when using Hypershift. Though I had a little bit of trouble of when the package was going to ship, the seller was very nice to me and helped me track my package. This was especially because I bought this around the holidays, so it did take longer than expected, but isn't a problem to me. As much as I wanted to opt in for the Huntsman Elite, I really think this is a nice alternative if this keyboard is on sale since they both have so much in common. One thing uncommon about them is their switches, but both are really great.The final question: Is this keyboard for you?If you want all of Razer Synapse's features, lighting and programmable keys for a good price then this keyboard is definitely a great option if it's on sale. If you want the feel of a mechanical switch, but want the soft cushion of a membrane keyboard, then this keyboard is a great option!",
          "Fingerprints are immediately left on this thing, you really need to clean it with alcohol wipes after every use. Wasn't expecting it to pick up grease like one of those face oil wiping absorption pads. Otherwise I really like the feel and clicky clack of the keys.Chroma is fun but a little bit too much spill for visibility beyond random patterns.Wrist pad is too tall and forces your hands into a weird angle, works better without it."

It looks good and functions fine, but when I went to download the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lights, I read in their license agreement that Razer sells your personal information and data to third parties. And in case of a data breach at Razer, personal info and data could be accessed by bad actors. So I won\u2019t be downloading it. Luckily there is open source software to change the RGB lighting.",
          "I am really picky when it comes to keyboards, not for gaming but for typing in my office.  I already replaced this one because it just didn't work for me as well as others.  It's a good quality build and easy and comfortable to type.  It's definitely not silent typing, it is actually a bit noisy.  I didn't like that I wasn't able to make the backlight only one color, it is constantly multiple colors.  I never used the wrist rest with it because it's just hard plastic and it wasn't really necessary.  I was just unimpressed.",
          "I usually stay away from membrane keyboards, they tend to be mushy and something that is not easy to get used to if you have high standards for your subjective typing experience due to primarily using mechanical keyboards. The \u201cMecha-Mebrane\u201d feature intrigued me, especially since clicky is my favorite type of mechanical switch, that combined with this being low-profile was enough to get me to order it.I think this board is a really nice option for people who want a low-profile board with Synapse integration and customizable RGB. The backlight is actually really nice-looking and I even prefer it to my DeathStalker V2 Pro, it\u2019s more of a bright and vibrant looking than normal Razer keyboards.The Mecha-Mebrane feels very close to clicky type of switches, it probably wouldn\u2019t fool a keyboard aficionado, but I doubt the average PC gamer or just regular consumer would be able to tell it wasn\u2019t a real mechanical board. It\u2019s leagues better than most membrane boards and I think it\u2019s good enough to justify the price. Although it\u2019s worth mentioning that you could get a decent budget board with RGB and wireless functionality AND with real switches for roundabout this price.One downside is it\u2019s wired only, but how big of a deal is that really? How often do you find yourself typing from farther away from your computer than 1-2 feet? The USB cable is permanently attached to the keyboard, I know some people appreciate unpluggable cables, even on wired only keyboards and controllers, but you don\u2019t get that here.On a final note, I really like the magnetic wrist rest and wish Razer would do this on their higher end keyboards, which most don\u2019t have this functionality. It\u2019s a nice touch and you don\u2019t even really need a wrist rest for low profile boards, so it\u2019s cool to see it included.",
          "Feels as if it is brand new. Even came with the stickers and everything you would get if you bought it brand new.",
          "The arrows on this don't work and contacting customer support is no help. I have a Windows 11 and can't get any info on how to fix the arrow problem. The blogs don't help, and customer support keeps sending me the same emails over and over, send serial number model etc. Not happy at all, I need to use the arrows, what's up Razer?",
          "This is not supported by Mac. I see why I got it 70% off.",
          "Amazing quality, and beyond amazing delivery time. Especially over a holiday weekend. I ordered this early Friday morning and was pleasantly surprised to receive it by Sunday. They seriously must have driven it right to my house it was that fast. Amazing price, amazing quality. Everything was in original packaging with plastic and instruction manual. Lights work and it sounds AMAZING. Very quiet, and comfortable keyboard. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Thank you!",
          "So before this keyboard I had the Razer Ornata V2. In a lot of ways they're exactly the same, they're about the same size, same quality keys. But I had the regular ornata v2, not the low profile, and oh my is the difference amazing. The keys on this Ornata v3 feel great, they're quieter, and the whole thing is just amazing quality. The RGB lighting is awesome, and the way these keyboards are setup makes them really easy to clean. If you're looking for a quality keyboard that will survive hours of gaming and button mashing this is the one.",
          "Perfection. Finally",
          "i loved the design and over all quality but the clicking sounds it makes when you type a key is kind of annoying but mostly you get used to it and now i kind of like the clicky sound but at first you will probably think its to loud also i like how the ramp up to the keyboard is magnetic instead of the usual attaching ones that break easily",
          "Simplicity and looks",
          "I am disappointed in this as the lighting on the key surfaces is drowned out by the backlighting. I will just stop using this and look for a replacement with illuminated keys but not where the entire area under the keys is lit up. For reference, my favorite keyboard is the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard, which doesnt have this problem.Additionally, the wrist rest is not held in place, so easily slides around. If you are someone that ever moves your keyboard, and wants the wrist rest, it is a hassle.Otherwise the keyboard types fine. I like the key height and responsiveness.",
          "It has a bit lower profile compared to V2. Keys sound is louder a bit. Support bar is plastic and not comfortable. Space bar sounds a bit different. Looks cheaper in general.---Changed rating from 3 stars to 4.5-5 after almost 1 month use. It's VERY comfortable to type on. The only cons: spacebar sound differs from other keys and design of volume control looks a bit \"cheap\". But I got used to it and now it's my main driver. Do recommend 100%.",
          "Razer Ornata V3 Gaming Keyboard: Low-Profile Keys - Mecha-Membrane Switches - UV-Coated Keycaps - Backlit Media Keys - 10-Zone RGB Lighting - Spill-Resistant - Magnetic Wrist Wrest - Classic BlackFor membrane switches these sound and feel like clicky blue switches. The feel of the board is ok and has great response, but I was expecting something quieter. The keycaps showed shininess to them almost immediately and the wrist rest also shows a lot as well. The RGB is bright and can easily be customized in the Razer Synapse software. It very thin and low profile which is super comfortable for me and is very well made. I didn't have any issues while gaming with sticky or mushy key presses. Overall, it is a solid keyboard but it's just not for me.",
          "Ornata V3 X:I didn't realize I ordered this keyboard used. It was less than 10% off. It appeared \"Like New\" for a few weeks until paint started chipping off the WASD keys. I would have spent the $5 for brand new.Love the keyboard though. I much prefer it to the original V3 because it's quiet.",
          "I dont know who lied to razer but this keyboard is not low profile. It is a regular keyboard that clicks and clacks annoyingly and that was the sole reason why I didnt want a standard keyboard. Wasted my money.",
          "I cannot rate this because I never used it. When I discovered that the wrist pad could not be attached I had to return it because of my particular setup (inside a desk drawer) requires the support. It would have been helpful had they mentioned this or shown a slight gap in the picture between pad and keyboard.",
          "My nearly 14-year-old son spends more hours per day gaming than I'd like to admit.  He has gone through quite a few keyboards in his lifetime.  His most recent keyboard has been an Alienware keyboard that was more than $100, though I struggled to find the exact model for you.  Anyway, when I had the chance to try out this Razer keyboard as an Amazon Vine Reviewer, I jumped at it, as he loves Razer products, as well.  Unfortunately, prying him away from his computer long enough to get him to try this keyboard was not easy.It didn't take long for my son to decide that he wanted to keep using this keyboard instead of his Alienware.  When I asked him why, his first response was that this keyboard is so much quieter.  I will definitely attest to that!  We were all so used to hearing his Alienware keyboard going clickety clack that we hardly remembered what silence sounded like.  Wonderful!  To be fair, it is not truly silent, but compared to other keyboards he has owned, this one is VERY quiet.In addition to being quiet, this keyboard is very responsive for gamers.  I know that my son has rejected really expensive keyboards because there were not responsive, or keys stuck or repeated.  No such complaints here.  This appears to be a real performer.Of course, I have to mention value.  At the current price of $69.99, this is truly an exceptional value.  He has owned many keyboards that sold for more than $100, and this high performer sells at quite a discount to $100.  Amazing.Lastly, like all Razer products, it is a quality product, from the aesthetic design and lighting right down to the packaging.  Everything here says premium.We have no complaints and lots of praise for this keyboard--an easy 5 stars!  Buy with confidence!",
          "I buy ONLY this brand and noticed that the keys seemed to be a tiny bit smaller and the board as well. Put it up against older ones we keep for parts, and it is ever so slightly smaller from the board to the keys and the program to allow me to adjust the colors does not work. No biggie until you are hitting keys in a raid and the color changing gets annoying.",
          "I was using this keyboard to write this review as you read this. I was previously using the Razer Huntsman Mini - Clicky Optical Switch (Mercury) previously (pictured above). I liked having the extra desk space with the 60% form, however I desperately needed a num-pad. My first Razer keyboard was the Razer Ornata V2. It was a great keyboard. The V3 has improved upon the V2, with brighter RGB, and low-profile keys. It comes with a magnetic wrist rest. The V2 came with a leatherette one. This one feels soft to the touch, like their plastic wrist rest with a silk top layer. It doesn't have a scroll media wheel as you can see in the picture, instead opting for normal media keys as seen in their other lines of keyboards. I must admit, the scroll wheel gave it a unique look and feel. I purchased my first Razer products on August 31, 2021 in the All-Star Bundle, and I haven't looked back since. They are the top in their game, where even the middle-tier of what they have to offer is top notch. For the price, you will not be disappointed! This is not for the Ornata V3 X which seems to be the entry level keyboard with silent switches. This keyboard has mecha-membrane keys which are to be a hybrid of their clicky and membrane keys. It is still very much clicky, however is not hot-swappable. I learned this the hard way with the V2, and ended up buying the BlackWidow V3. I had to put away my Sneki Snek keycap because it will not fit on this keyboard. When laid flat, the keyboard is 27.05mm thick, and the keys themselves only 4.40mm. This has quickly become my favorite keyboard since getting it, and the main one I use for work. I don't dive deep in to the world of PC gaming, so I can't recommend it for that, but I will however recommend it for your daily, multi-purpose keyboard.Side note: You do not need to use Razer Synapse to customize the RGB. It works well without it. If you do, however have multiple Razer products and would like them to sync, then of course you'll need it. I am on my work computer, so I cannot install it. In fact, it has been black listed by my company. When I did have Synapse installed, it did make my computer run sluggish and misbehave.",
          "Razer as a brand used to mean something. I've owned their products before and they were fantastic. This keyboard falls way short of coming close to what I've had previously.The program/drivers used to control the color of the keyboard and use special color patterns barely works. When you pick a style, it does what the opposite of what you think it would do. Say I pick a color combo and want it to circle or fade, and it will, KIND OF. This thing flickers between colors on every setting worse than a haunted house on Halloween. If you want this for anything besides a solid color, go elsewhere, like a Corsair for $10 more.Keys are nice, everything types well and all the keys work, so that's a good thing.",
          "I\u2019ve wanted a more mechanical-feeling keyboard for my home office work for awhile. I\u2019m not too worried about gaming performance, speed of click registration, or multi-key presses simultaneously registering.What I was concerned about was a snappy and satisfying haptic, tactile, and audible \u201cclick\u201d and this keyboard absolutely accomplishes those requirements!I hooked this up to an iMac and everything worked just fine. The windows key becomes the mac command key, and some of the keys like scroll lock and pause work for Mac OS features like brightness. Honestly I didn\u2019t check to see if there is any software that lets me adjust the key bindings or RGB lights. By default it just cycles through several colors.I like the magnetically attached wrist rest. It is soft to the touch but has no actual cushion. I have bad typing habits so I rest my wrists down. Usually I prefer a gel padded rest. The included rest works, but I do wish it was cushioned.I\u2019m pretty happy with this keyboard in any case. Simple, nice to have the backlit keys at night, and very satisfying to type on!",
          "telling you ahead, if you are big person with big hands, this may have been somewhat small for you or for your fingers as the buttons are smaller than usual.Compact ergonomic size, excellent comfort, wrist rest comes includes, close distance between buttons, very nice led lighting and high response time is amazing. Price is very very affordable!",
          "This is a really good keyboard, but something about it still feels like an OEM keyboard with lights. (Note: I use this keyboard to type, not game, and I type A LOT)That being said, THE LIGHTS ARE AWESOME, Razer has always excelled at it's lighting (The software to control it is another story) and this keyboard does not disappoint, it has more color combinations than I've ever seen, I just have it on the basic color spectrum, shift, and it never seems to run out of colors!",
          "I bought this keyboard for the programmable lighting effect. It works well, but now is useless, and constantly set to full brightness and color change due to a hack that the manufacturer just \"fixed\" by making the synapse software inaccessible if you use this on a work computer without admin rights. Get something that is not a Razer to avoid this issue.",
          "This review is for: Razer Ornata V3 Gaming Keyboard: Low-Profile Keys - Mecha-Membrane Switches - UV-Coated Keycaps - Backlit Media Keys - 10-Zone RGB Lighting - Spill-Resistant - Magnetic Wrist Wrest - Classic Black (Ornata V3)I'm a fan of low-profile keys.  These are somewhat low-profile, but now as low-profile as I'm used to.  They are also clickier than I would like.  I know it's not popular, but I'm not a fan of clicky keys.The backlighting is pretty spectacular looking.  I haven't had an RGB keyboard before.  If it were based on looks, I would give this keyboard 5 stars.I would say for the price, this is a pretty nice keyboard.  Keyboards are a pretty personal item... everyone has different preferences.I'm not sure that this will be my go-to keyboard, but it is nice.  I don't use my PC for gaming, so I can't speak on it as a gaming keyboard.Hope this was helpful.",
          "I'm a HUGE fan of RAZER gear. I selected this keyboard for the main editing station in my podcast studio. Soft touch keys are not for me. I love the old-school tactile feel of a gaming keyboard and this model does not disappoint.The magnetic, removable wrist rest is a great touch as well.I've gone through 5+ gaming keyboards in the past 4 years in my editing space and this is truthfully the best one I've encountered by far. This keyboard offers an exceptional tactile experience at an extremely valuable price point. I couldn't be more pleased.Rating: 5 stars. Highly recommended.",
          "This keyboard is very well designed. I use this as an everyday keyboard in my home office and love the simplicity of it with the added features to make it look and feel like a more expensive keyboard. The RGB lighting is really cool looking and extremely customizable through the software. You are able to turn on different color lighting as well as make the lights have different effects.The keys on this unit are soft touch and have a very slight clicking noise which is nice compared to some keyboards that have a loud clunking sound when the keys are pressed. The latency is null on this keyboard due to it being a wired connection. The keyboard also features a removable wrist rest that simply is placed or removed via magnetic connection.A great keyboard that stands up to the Razer branding and looks and feels just like the more expensive competitors. Highly recommend!",
          "mechanical with sticky membrane catches. Nice sound and beautiful RGB. Big Love!",
          "This is a nice keyboard, especially for the price. It's great as a starter keyboard or basic use, but not someone who is into gaming imo. I really like the style of it and that it comes with a magnetic wrist mat. The back lighting is nuce, very bright and colorful, and you can customize how you like. It's comfortable to type on, but I feel the keys are too mushy and quiet. I like a more clicky feel and louder typing sound. I got it to use for my pc gaming, but I'm looking for another keyboard at the moment. I've been using this one to do everyday things on the computer. Overall for the price, it's a solid basic keyboard for anyone. I would recommend it, but like I said before not necessarily for gaming.",
          "Have to plug it back in every time I restart my PC.Go buy literally any other keyboard.",
          "Been using an Ornata v2 for the past ~1.5 years, so will be comparing this to that.  In short, the v3 doesn\u2019t feel like an upgrade, but a slight downgrade (or maybe a lateral change, with some pluses and minuses).  Along with some things I point out below, MSRP of $70 for the v3 compared to $100 for the v2 suggests it\u2019s a downgrade.  FYI - I\u2019m a long time PC gamer, but not a huge keyboard enthusiast, so I may be getting some of the terminology slightly wrong.Improvements I like:- Space bar doesn\u2019t feel as wobbly/rattle-y as the v2.- Slimmer base/frame.- Visually, there\u2019s a larger gap between the keycaps and the base plate/frame compared to the v2.  This gives a look similar to a lot of enthusiast keyboards and lets more of that sweet RGB light through (which you can of course turn down).- Discreet branding on top of the frame (below the right alt and fn keys).  The v2\u2019s branding is on the front side, which is covered when using the wrist rest.  If you\u2019re forking out for Razer, odds are you want to at least subtly show it off.Things that are\u2026 different:- Overall, the v3 isn\u2019t as clicky.  On one hand, it\u2019s a bit quieter (not that the v2 is loud), which is nice for calls/etc, but on the other hand aren\u2019t the clicks a large part of what you\u2019re paying for?  Like the v2, it depends a bit on where exactly you press on the key, with the bottom being clickier than the top.- I was skeptical of the shorter switches claim as they initially felt similar in height/travel, but after using it for a while, key presses on the v3 do feel a bit shorter.- Popping off the same key on both keyboards, the stem/lower part of the key actually seems a smidge taller on the v3 (pic).- The keycap tops have a flatter curve than the v2, being a bit more square vs. trapezoidal (pic).- The keycaps have a slightly less matte finish.  It\u2019s too early to tell of course on the v3, but the finish on a few of my v2 keys has worn down to become glossy.Changes I dislike:- The keys/switches have more of a \u201cthunk\u201d at the end, the action not feeling as crisp and sharp as the v2.  This may be in part to personal typing style, as typing lighter may get around it.- The v3\u2019s media buttons seem out of place, especially since they don\u2019t match the rest of the keys, having a super short travel of maybe 1-2mm.  The v2\u2019s media keys matched the rest of its keys, plus I rather liked the v2\u2019s scroll wheel (defaulted to volume control, and un/mute when pressed).- The raised bumps on the F, J. and 5 keys are quite tall and a little sharp in that your finger can kinda catch on them.  You get used to it though.- Wrist wrest surface seems to be a thin firm silicone.  The v2 had a cushy pleather that felt nicer, and is still  in good shape after 1.5 years.- 10 zone RGB is ok, but the v2 had individually backlit keys so you could get REALLY fancy like having WASD a different color and/or have much more complex lighting effects.- The v2 tech specs on Razer\u2019s site states \u201cN-key roll over\u201d as a feature.  I didn\u2019t see that mentioned anywhere for the v3, so I suspect it\u2019s been removed..Things that are the same:- No USB passthrough- If you don\u2019t have the Razer software suite running (whether it\u2019s a locked down work machine or by personal choice), the keyboard defaults to constantly cycling through the rainbow.  There\u2019s also no onboard memory, so you can\u2019t just config it once, then uninstall.  If you just want a simple solid color, it can be a bit of a resource hog at ~220 MB of memory.  If you do install the suite, it\u2019s fairly easy to use and allows you to get fancy with your RGB, especially if you have other Razer devices.- While I\u2019m not familiar with the enthusiast keyboard market, I\u2019m assuming being Razer, there\u2019s a decent premium in cost over similar options from lesser known brands.To summarize, the v3 is a step up from a basic OEM membrane keyboard and on its own is a decent upgrade, but the v2 is a bigger step up in most ways both objectively and subjectively.",
          "Its a good feeling keyboard for membrane, very smooth and extremely silent. The wrist wrest is NOT padded but is AMAZING and helped a ton.  It does not sit flush with the keyboard if you have the legs up.I had an issue where I couldn't press key combos together that are necessary in most games. I was not able to press W + Space + Q or E (aka, running forward, jumping, and using an ability or nade) it was a pretty big issue. I also could not press W + D + E or Q + W + E together, it could have been a one off issue with my specific keyboard but it its big enough to mention incase it helps anyone in the future.",
          "Be advised - this does not support NKRO which means you cannot hit more than 2 buttons at a time. If you're gaming with M&K this simply will not do. But if you are purchasing it for casual/work use it is acceptable for the price. My only real complaint is that the wrist rest is not magnetic. I'd recommend spending a little bit more and purchasing the Steel Series Apex 3. The switches are quieter, supports NKRO, and has a magnetic wrist wrest. It's what this keyboard should be.",
          "This was a huge stepup from my last gaming keyboard. I love the feel of the keys as it's not too loud but also gives a good sound when typing. The lighting is great, but I'm not a fan of the software (is anyone?).",
          "All my gaming peripherals are razer products. This is as good of quality as any other razer product at half the price. Low profile so it doesn't hurt your wrist and is very quiet compared to most gaming keyboards",
          "Rule #1 for \"gaming\" keyboards is N-Key Rollover.  This means that there is not a max number of key inputs the keyboard can process at one time.  I assumed being a Razer gaming keyboard that this would be standard.  It is not.  I returned within 48 hours of receiving.  I should have read through the description in more detail.Other than that, the lights are pretty and it types nicely.  Nonetheless, do not buy if you plan on gaming.",
          "It's a great keyboard but the wrist rest is completely pathetic.. If you need it DO NOT buy this. If you don't it really is a great keyboard.",
          "The Razer Ornata V3x is a decent backlit keyboard, just as long as you don't plan on gaming with it. This keyboard doesn't support NKRO (N Key Rollover), and only has a 6 key rollover. What this essentially means is that if you're playing a game and you're trying to push multiple buttons at once for movement or actions, they may not all register as pressed. I wish I knew this before I bought this because aside from that, this is a really nice keyboard for the money. The backlighting is great, it's very bright compared to other membrane gaming keyboards, the membrane \"switches\" feel very nice and they're quiet compared to other membrane gaming keyboards. The design is unobtrusive and very minimal for Razer, which I personally prefer. One other con I should mention is that the included wrist rest doesn't physically attach to the keyboard, rather it just sits close to the keyboard. Aside from the two negatives I've listed, for general non-gaming use, this keyboard checks a lot of boxes. However, if you're getting a keyboard and planning to game on it, I can't recommend this because of the lack of NKRO. If you want a membrane option from Razer that does have NKRO, I'd recommend any versions of the Cynosa, if you can find them. I'm relatively certain that Amazon does have them. Also if you live close to a place like MicroCenter, they should also have it.",
          "Pressing combinations like Shift+W+A will stop you from adding a press like E, for example. This could be troublesome for some games. The keyboard itself feels excellent, but this simply stops it from being an actual gaming-grade keyboard.",
          "Its great for gaming the lights for it look super cool but i would recomend a separate wrist rest but other than that its really comfortable to use and is super great quality",
          "The keys feel pretty good, they click well, they respond well, and they are sized well for accurate controls. It's got a shorter travel but they were easy to get used to. The pad is pretty good and keeps my wrists comfortable for hours. The only problem I had was when a few times the keyboard wasn't registering all the clicks in a complex sequence. It also feels like a budget model. The keys don't have the most pleasant clicks. Theres not much weight to it and the whole thing is plastic. It's a good budget keyboard, but not the most competitive in quality for this price range.",
          "Love this keyboard. I needed a new one and I'm very happy with all the features!I'd recommend it and am looking at other Razer products.",
          "For daily home and business use this keyboard gets 5 stars. Great lighting, wrist pad is comfortable, and keys are nice and smooth. For gaming I have to give this only 1 star. I'm not sure if this is a defect or a fixable issue but the keyboard suffers from ghosting (box does not say it has anti-ghosting). In a nutshell you can only have a total of 3 keys actuated at once, no other keys can be activated unless one of those keys are released. If you are doing a lot of high active keyboard gaming, you are going to run into key delay issues.",
          "I normally don\u2019t make time to review products. Generally, I move on with either a great product or a great lesson. Unfortunately, after having been a consumer of Razer products over the last 7+ years I have decided enough is enough.I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that their products are decent for 2 years and shortly after need to be repaired or replaced. Specifically, I have purchased and used many of their peripherals. Many mice, several keyboards, 2 blackshark pro headsets, and even a gaming chair.My reasoning for calling it a quits as a customer of theirs is a recent experience. In the past couple years, I\u2019ve had to replace each of the mice I\u2019ve purchased or send it for a replacement/repair.Recently, my Ornata keyboard was determined to be defective by one of their technical support members. Despite being out of the warranty window by a few months. She stated they would replace the keyboard because it was defective. All I had to do was send in my purchase proof, which I did the very same day.Weeks went by without a follow up, despite my repeated efforts of reaching out via the email provided to me. I had to again call the support team for assistance. The new support agent I got ahold of contradicted what the previous member stated in regard to replacement.Which is understandable if I wasn\u2019t told previously the product would be replaced. It led me to believe that the previous support agent ghosted me after she realized she had made a mistake and hoped I wouldn\u2019t call back.I asked to speak to a supervisor after waiting on hold for almost an hour. One was not available and I had to wait for a call back, which I did receive promptly to be fair.The supervisor apologized and all that good stuff, basic customer service training and said they\u2019d reconsider.Yesterday I received my reconsideration decision that they won\u2019t be replacing but gave me a %15 off coupon directly for their site.For me personally, the products don\u2019t measure up to their competitors. And this experience was the nail in the coffin for me. 2 years has been a consistent life span for each of their products to my experience. I felt it was important to share with all",
          "Review for: Razer Ornata V3 Gaming Keyboard: Low-Profile Keys - Mecha-Membrane Switches - UV-Coated Keycaps - Backlit Media Keys - 10-Zone RGB Lighting - Spill-Resistant - Magnetic Wrist Wrest - Classic Black (Ornata V3)For fans of the Ornata V2, this is a good upgrade. A lot of improvements have been made from V1 to V3.The price is really great at only $70.There's some really great in-depth information on this thread already so it's hard to expound upon it as a casual keyboard user. Personally, I use a keyboard FOREVER. Decades. I even got an old IBM one on ebay and used that for about 6 years until it broke.Pros=Price is under $100 which I'd say this type of board used to be a $150 type board in the older days.=My favorite feature is the media keys in the top right=Standard color operations which honestly I never mess with.=Razer=not insanely loud like some of them we have. I have a LOT of different keyboards.=magnetic wristpad is a great idea/feature=durability has been pretty good on razor boards so far, haven't had any break with 1000s of hours of usage.Cons=still not super quiet=Razer software is super annoying. It always wants to do something stupid like update.",
          "I have to confess I'm not a PC gamer, which makes it weird that I keep moving from gaming keyboard to gaming keyboard. My previous keyboard was a Logitech G510, which I used almost entirely for typing in my home office (with the occasional gaming break). I finally had to get rid of it because everything about it just felt a bit...much for me.The Razer Ornata feels like a great middle ground for someone like me. It's a perfectly serviceable, slightly flashy work keyboard that can also accommodate light gaming. It has great light effects, which keep my work day interesting. The key presses are halfway between a heavy mechanical keyboard and a laptop \"chiclet\" style keyboard, which is great for fast, error-free typing. The media keys are also a nice bonus.The wrist rest is the one part that feels a bit phoned in. It connects magnetically to the keyboard, but the magnets aren't strong enough to keep it in place if you keep your wrists low enough to actually, y'know, touch the wrist rest. It slopes down, which makes it next to useless ergonomically, and it's hard plastic, so it's not even comfortable to put your wrists on it in the first place. I know this is a lot of virtual ink to spill about something that's really just tacked on, but I feel like they could've done better than making it FEEL like it's just tacked on.Aside from that, I'm in love with this keyboard.",
          "First off this isn't a mechanical keyboard in a traditional sense. Keyboard is very clicky, and pretty loud with its clicks.  Lighting options are great and love that it has multimedia buttons directly on the right hand side above the numpad for ease of use.  The keys are spaced pretty well from each other to allow you to type well using it.  The keys have a chiclet kind of style to them, meaning the kay itself is really only on the top with a much longer stem to connect the key to the board. No real wobble in the keys with this, which is what I was worried about.  I have to say I use this keyboard at work as my office keyboard and it does just fine. Typing is smooth and fast and no issues with day to day usage.",
          "Bought this to replace my Corsair K55. The keys are lower profile and the RGB is definitely brighter. The K55 was also much deeper, heavier sound while the Ornata is lighter and higher. The Razer Synapse software is also much more customizable and has more presets. The wrist wrest is also much softer and comfortable as it doesn't have a texture to it that can be uncomfortable. Overall I definitely recommend if you are a fan of the \"Mecha-membrane\" style of keyboard.",
          "I'm not really a keyboard person but I've always wanted to try out something 'more' and this was a nice start for me. I really like the wrist rest but as I am not used to it, I find myself removing it often. However, it is very easy to take off and put back on which is great. I really like the lighting on the keyboard. You can do multi-colored or solid and it comes with software to customize everything with it, including keybinding / macro, which I love. It's a bit intimidating though so I haven't ventured any further that that. The brightness, however, was a little distracting for someone like me who's never used a light up keyboard and does a lot of computer work and play at night. I can turn it off but it feels a bit like a waste to me as the RGB is a feature. The keys are also much quieter and 'softer' than the ones I have. I do have a personal preference for higher keys than this as I got longer nails and shorter keys make it more difficult for me to use since I type a lot. I think it's a good keyboard in general, but maybe not for someone like me."

          "I bought this amazing keyboard for my son primarily for gaming. He is 9 and it is a good fit for his hands. It has the mechanical keyboard click but not too loud like some of the others we looked at. A Corsair mini I believe it was. The lights are amazing and adjustable with the software download. It works on his laptop and on the playstation 4. He has a Red Dragon mouse that he uses with it and they work great together.",
          "So it's everything I need it to be in a compact gaming keyboard for the most part, I didn't love that I had to buy a wrist wrest separately (I used the razer mouse pad wrist wrest) and the key lights aren't very bright but those are really my only gripes, you can swap keycaps out of you really need them brighter but you'll probably lose the function key indicators. I also wanna mention that I was looking for a keyboard upgrade for almost a year from a linear Corssair that I had gotten very tired of and while I love a good clicky switch, they are ultimately too loud and a mic will pick it up so I just went to Best Buy, checked out what they had in display, and to my amazement, immediately fell in love with another linear lol, it's the most satisfying and quiet linear I've ever used and I can't recommend it enough.",
          "It\u2019s a great keyboard no delay",
          "5 stars! Works great! Nice size if you don\u2019t want a large one.",
          "Ordered for a friend for his birthday. He is just happy from such a gift, he likes everything and the sound and switches, and the color and RGB lighting, everything is just super!",
          "I took a risk on the linear keyboard as this would be my first one and I'm not disappointed. Key strokes are smooth and the keys are ultra responsive. While I'm sure a keyboard enthusiasts could find something wrong with it, I have 0 complaints so far.",
          "This is a great keyboard if you want a more quiet keystroke, is significantly more quiet than a mechanical key and is very responsive.",
          "I've had one other Razer board prior to this had clicky switches, which I was not a fan of. Went with the linear opticals, which I would say was the smart play. These are almost like cherry red silent switches, although you can here the key bottoming out. Some of my switches rattle more with their design, especially the space bar. Build wuality is decent although it feels too light. I wish they did this with an all aluminum frame like HyperX. Overall, I think it's a fine board for gaming, but I don't know if I would recommend it at full price with other boards available as this about two years old. I picked it up on Prime Day foe $80, and I think thats a fair price for it.",
          "Esta muy bueno, sin duda se nota la velocidad al presionar los keycaps y es bastante silencioso (switches Rojos)",
          "If you can find one of these under Used-like new. Immediately purchase this! I found my hunstman mini Linear for 55 dollars and it even came in the origingal packaging. This keyboard is a massive upgrade for anyone on a budget.",
          "It\u2019s a very good mechanical keyboard, if you are planning to have a small and sturdy one, I definitively recommend this one.",
          "This is my FIRST gaming keyboard. I've been doing so much research on keyboards, since I had less than 0 experience or knowledge. I didn't want to spend over $200 to just custom make my own keyboard. the 60% makes my small desktop way bigger to get work done. After a lot of research it came down to this keyboard or the Ducky Mecha mini, both had an aluminum backing, stock PBT keys, tons of RGB settings/costume options. This keyboard beat the Mecha mini for me because its faster, optical switches>mechanical, two feet heights and the software lets me do a little more for RGB. The only things the Mecha mini had on the Huntsman mini was a few more FN controls, and the memory so you can keep your keyboard settings no matter where you take and plug. Since I was never going to move it, this was the keyboard for me.I bought:Dark Red TEZ cables to add a pop of colorPudding keycaps(anything for cherry tops works) (HypeX pudding keycaps)(You lose FN key labels on stock keys)Aqua control+ mousepad(Durability+more than fair glide)Wooting TKL silicone wrist rest(1.5\" overhang on each side of keyboard)The first two I got from here on AMAZON.",
          "Overall, this is a great keyboard. I come from using a Vortex Race 3 TKL (65%) with Cherry Reds, and while the switches still don't quite match that level of frictionless action, they still feel good after adapting to the change. It's very small and easily transportable (the product box is also rather small and even fits in my backpack).Of course, this being Razer, it is not the mechanical keyboard that uber mechanical keyboard fans may want. The function keys are applied through Razer's Hypershift feature in their Synapse software (it's also hardcoded into the keyboard, so you do not need the software to use the function keys). What this results in, though, is those keys being unavailable for custom keybindings; for example, if you wanted to change the arrow keys in the fn layer to the Vim layout, you cannot. I, personally, never leveraged the different layers and whatnot available in the Race TKL 3, but I could see this limiting for some (though you could probably use profiles in Synapse as a form of emulating that behavior since all but the fn and Windows key are re-mappable on the primary layer).",
          "I purchased the Razer Mini 60% Linear Switches.The keyboard is amazing !!! I am coming from the Razer Huntmans Elite, and I wish I made the switch sooner!!The keyboard is small but enough for gaming, I don\u2019t use most keys, but I still have them due to the FN giving me the other keys.The linear switches feel and sound great and satisfying!!I also modded the keyboard with some EVA form 2mm into the case to dampen the noise, which made a huge difference! And I also bought custom keycaps and Giyu space bar. They fit the keyboard for the stabilizers you need to remove the insert from the keycaps and put it into the new keycaps, in case you didn\u2019t know.Overall the keyboard is fast, responsive, satisfying sound, and I might start to build my own keyboard in the future.Highly recommended ! This my first time doing mods, I watch a YouTube videos from Randomfrankp and it was super easy and fun!",
          "People tend to automatically think that there's a razer \"brand tax\",  and i would say that this is true to an extent--however, as a casual consumer who values well-designed & executed products as well as ease of use, i thoroughly enjoy this keyboard. I think that razer did a pretty good job when it comes to mass-produced, user-friendly, versatile, performance keyboard with great features such as pbt caps (as opposed to abs) and great IMPROVED switches compared to the huntsman te red switches. Synpase makes it easier to customize various settings compared to other 60% keyboards like the ducky 1 2.several youtubers such as randomfrankp provides great detailed reviews and instructions on basic mods that EXPONENTIALLY improves the keyboard performance imo. And as someone who isnt TOO diy inclined when it comes to electronics, i would say that it was 3/10 difficulty with the hardest part being the lubing each switch by hand.I found using foam window seals (any size between 1/4 to 1/2 thickness) was extremely easy for the sound dampening & weight. I also found that my spacebar key sounded a little \"springy\" / \"clacky\" when returning, so i added small strips of the foam seal which helped without any bottoming-out mushy side effect.Although lubing each switch (make sure to usedry lube like wd40's dry lube spray w/ ptfe) is optional as razer claims that they leave the factory already lubed up, ive seen from several reviews and saw from close inspection that there were very little, if none on the contact points. While the difference is probably negligible, i didnt mind popping the switches out for the peace of mind it gives me knowing that the plastic points should move smoothly longer than it would have without the added application.rgb is not perfect as i wish the brightness setting would go up a little higher--nitpicking.overall very satisfied with the product",
          "I really love the feel of it, pretty smooth and almost no noise coming out of it every time I press a key.I used to have the ornata v2 from razer and decided to get an upgrade because I hated the clickly feel of their keys and how much space it took on my desk.I hesitated at first because it was missing the media keys which I really loved plus every other key like prtscrn and ctrl+del, but after trying out the fn keys (hypershift) on the keyboard, all those worries disappeared! Really easy to remap and use.So, the only downsides I saw to this keyboard were some aspects of its quality, not sure if it's just me or the same to everyone else but some keys look like they're missing a little bit of paint where the letters/numbers reside, or at least that's what it looks like to me. Also, the rgb on it isn't bright enough like other mechanical keyboards I've tried (from friends).One other thing is the fact that it doesn't come with a wrist rest, which is a huge downside to me as I really loved it on my ornata v2.Aside from the bad, it's a great keyboard, love its feel and the small amount of space it takes on my desk, would highly recommend to buy.",
          "This was an oversight on my part when I purchased the keyboard..... But the navigation key functions can only be accessed indirectly by using a \"fn\" key..... Furthermore, the \"fn\" key is on the right side of the keyboard, making it even more awkward to use.  This is a major flaw of what would otherwise be a very nice compact keyboard.",
          "Llevo con el desde mediados de junio, y me ha funcionado sin problema, es bastante practico por su tama\u00f1o, me sirve cuando salgo de viaje; la calidad de los materiales es muy buena",
          "Pretty good, the only thing that's a small negative is some keycaps do not fit. There's also limited lighting effects without razer synapse. Still really good though.",
          "It\u2019s the most best keyboard I have \ud83d\ude01",
          "It's a great keyboard when travelling...and gaming of course.",
          "This worked really well for me, its quit and clean.",
          "So I've always used some type of tactile switch, as I do a lot of typing. I was pretty hesitant to try out a linear. To my surprise the linear switches on this keyboard feel great for both gaming and typing.They keys are dampened with a silicone ring they they are fairly quite which is nice, they make a nice pleasant thocky sound. However, the space bar is a horrible rattly mess, the stabilizers on it are just plain bad. Not the worst space bar I've ever had, but really doesn't match the sound and feel of rest of the keyboard.Overall customization is good, except you can't rebind any keys that already have functions assigned to them. I'm not really a fan of the arrow keys being on i,j,k,l, and would like to rebind them to w,s,a,d like a sane gamer would but you can not rebind the w key as it already has a function bind.Overall, a solid keyboard but not a great one.",
          "I got this to upgrade from my mesh keyboard (not mechanical and it was full size) and it was the best keyboard I could\u2019ve chosen because it\u2019s nice and small, easy to move on the desk, and the linear switches that came with the type I got of the huntsman are sooo good. This keyboard is also great for Fortnite and obviously any other game. I customized the lighting on the razer software and made a nice light blue color move, and then I put nice white Japanese keycaps.",
          "This is my first quality keyboard and first 60% keyboard.  Previously I only had a red dragon keyboard so I do not have much experience with better options.  What I really like about the Razer products is all of the customization.  I am able to customizer the color scheme on the keyboard and adjust the speed of color change as well as what color each individual key is.  I like the sound of the click on this board as well.  It has some clicking but not as much as a lot of other gaming keyboards.  It's enough for me to hear but not too much to where it's all my stream will hear through my microphone.  The only part of the keyboard that does not feel as high quality is the space bar.  I noticed this right away and it was kind of weird to me since the space bar is probably the most used button on a keyboard.  If you're looking to get a 60% keyboard I would just make sure you mostly use the keyboard for gaming and not typing.  Because of the size you're missing easy access to many buttons.  You will have to use the function key in order to use delete, Page up, home, arrow keys etc.  Also the layout has taken a minute for me to get used to where my fingers are on the keyboard when I am typing.",
          "I didn't use this keyboard for gaming. I needed a mini keyboard that would help alleviate my shoulder mouse pain. This keyboard matched that. I needed a wired keyboard to alleviate lag when typing. This keyboard matched that. However, keys are boxy which made for clunky keystrokes while typing. I type on average 6 hours a day.",
          "Been using this keyboard for about a year. It's very well made and good quality. Good feel for both typing and for gaming. Easy to clean too. Had to get used to no number pad or arrow keys but the extra space on my desk is nice. The keys feel great, mechanical feel but with a softer click. Only downside is you can probably get a similar keyboard for a better price.",
          "So far after using it for a few hours in Black Ops 4, I\u2019m really enjoying this keyboard. It\u2019s responsive the way a keyboard should be. I went with the linear switches and I was quite impressed with how quiet they are. My Space bar has noticeable rattle but everything else feels and sounds great. Yes, it\u2019s a plastic keyboard and if you\u2019re use to aluminum bodied keyboards at first glance you might feel a bit turned off especially considering how light it is. Don\u2019t let this deter you from making this purchase. I came from a Durgod Venus, another 60% keyboard. I won\u2019t go into depth on my experience with it but if you can find my review, it\u2019s worth reading. Overall, I\u2019m more than satisfied with my purchase. I was a little put off by some of these reviews on YouTube but at the end of the day, a lot of that doesn\u2019t even matter.Pros\u2022 lightweight (great for portability)\u2022 linear switches are in comparison to Cherry Silent Reds but feel and sound better\u2022 fastest switches on the market\u2022 Synapse offers great customizationCons\u2022 plastic build\u2022 Space bar has noticeable rattle\u2022 no dust coverSeriously, if that\u2019s all I can think of for reasons why you shouldn\u2019t buy this keyboard then that\u2019s telling you something. I\u2019ll come back and update after 3 months for a final verdict but so far it\u2019s getting a recommendation from me.",
          "Was bought for my teenage son who uses for gaming. He is very happy with the keyboard so far. If it holds up to his use it will be a good purchase!",
          "I absolutely love 60 Percent Keyboards, however the one I had before this was a 60 percent I could have done well with just continuing to use that one, but I was really wanting something with some better lighting. and I was eyeing this keyboard up for a WHILE and I couldn't justify spending a 3rd of a paycheck on a keyboard, but I bought it when it went on sale. Either way, I am really happy I bought this keyboard its really nice and high quality and I really enjoy the Switches that came with the board, as well as the Razer Synapse Lighting software, is really nice and you can really bend the lighting to you will, really great software and keyboard if you want some nice lighting effects to tie into your set up.",
          "Way smaller than i expected but the kid loves it.",
          "I just want to put this out there, this keyboard is NOT a scam. Hear me out about this keyboard. Razer is a huge company in the gaming scene of many games (Fortnite for me).  Seeing their name pop up everywhere gives me comfort when I buy their products.Queue 1 week ago, my slow, old, ugly keyboard was really not keeping up with the speed I needed and wanted in game (Fortnite). I needed a new one and Razer came to mind.  Seeing all the pros dominate and put down enemies with this keyboard really pushed my desire for the thing.  BUT I didn\u2019t want to be dumb so like any person, I watched reviews, read reviews, and even checked more commercials.  This is the time I start to doubt this keyboard.After seeing tons of videos about how bad this keyboard was, I really worried if I should fall into Razer\u2019s hands and buy this keyboard. After days of conflict, I decided to buy it. Seeing almost every pro use it made me think if it really was that bad.  I won\u2019t regret this decision.Once this keyboard arrived, I found myself in love. All the things that the people had said were not true at all.  I even put on HyperX Pudding key caps and they still worked.  The Razer Synapse software was easy, convenient, and well-designed. Though the RGB could have been better and brighter, it will still satisfy your hunger. The switches were awesome. They were so fast at 1.0 mm actuation point that I was blown away. The small form factor also benefits players like me (in Fortnite).  The weight did not bother me at all and the keyboard didn\u2019t \u201cslide\u201d at all (though I did put it on my mousepad).  The look is sleek and minimalistic and you can see the letters clearly.  Overall, please buy this keyboard if you are an FPS gamer. It is so worth it and you will not regret it.However there are a few things I must mention: I recommend putting this on your mousepad to stabilize the keyboard and dampen vibrations making it feel \u201cfaster\u201d.  Also, I recommend downloading Chroma Studio for better control of your RGB in your Razer Synapse software. Lastly, I\u2019d recommend staying on the original keycaps that the keyboard comes with because they are so perfectly grippy, comfortable, and sleek.That\u2019s it from me. I really hope you do consider this keyboard because I did and I did not regret it. I hope you all stay safe during these times and cave in to your Gaming desires.  Thanks for listening and have a great day!",
          "its good but the stabilizers are a little loud",
          "Razer does a great job of describing the pros of this keyboard and is true to their advertising. If you\u2019re looking at getting the best response time in gaming, then you should invest in this, especially if you\u2019re limited on desk space, travel often, or are looking for a minimalist look.The optical linear option is extremely good for sound. I thought it might be too loud and not like Razer\u2019s stealth/silent mechanical keys, but they are excellent. If you have a roommate, family member, or coworker next to you, you won\u2019t have to worry about them getting annoyed.",
          "I recently purchased the Razer Huntsman Mini and have been extremely satisfied with my purchase. The compact size of the keyboard is great for saving desk space and making it easier to take on the go. The linear optical switches are fast and smooth, making it perfect for both gaming and programming.I love the customizable RGB lighting and the fact that it can be controlled through the Razer Synapse software. The build quality is solid and it has a sleek, modern design.One potential downside is the lack of dedicated media keys and macro programming, but for my needs, these features are not a deal breaker. Overall, I highly recommend the Razer Huntsman Mini for anyone in need of a compact, high-performance keyboard.",
          "Purchased for our grandson and he LOVES it!",
          "I used this keyboard for years without it not working on me even after I threw it on the floor after raging at a game. Very sturdy board with fast and smooth switches. 60% form factor amazing for gaming and really makes space on your desk for your mouse. Razer synapse allows for a lot of customization of the board. RGB is stunning on this board the chroma stands out and pops off of the board.",
          "Good",
          "I was in the market for an amazing 60% keyboard with great usability and Razor hit that mark. It's extremely durable and lightweight while retaining all the features you would see in a 60% keyboard with even more under the hood thanks to Synapse. This keyboard is beautiful and extremely comfortable to use. The choice of switches was perfect and I'm happy I was able to get a non clicky keyboard, as over the years I've chosen to make my build less loud and flashy and this keyboard hit that mark!",
          "Keys feel and sound nice. Extremely responsive and quiet. A few issues with the Synapse software caused some frustration but was eventually able to \"repair\" the software after redownloading. Good gift for anyone that mostly games and has been using a basic stock keyboard for awhile. Get it while it's on sale and pair it with the Razer leather mini wrist rest for a decent setup upgrade.*I'm using the \"Fire\" RGB effect which is only available in the Synapse Software.** Don't bother with the protection plan, Razer provides a 2-year warranty as long as you register the product on their website and it's easy.",
          "Great keyboard and feel. I have larger hands and it\u2019s hard for me to type fast and accurate in this keyboard due to keys feeling a little bit to cramped.",
          "As someone who spends a lot of time on the keyboard for work and personal projects this keyboard has been really amazing. I have only had it a few days but I am in love with the sound and feel of the keys. The switches seem like they will last a long time without having to do much, if any, maintenance on my part. Key caps have a great texture, F and J are easy to feel out, and the brightness of the north facing LEDs is clear but not too bright. The body feels well build and there is very little flex.The only thing that I can say I really dislike is the FN key and secondary key placement. I very rarely need to use my arrow keys but when I do it's nice to have them on or close to the home row (like vim keys). This does with having them on I (up), J (left), K (down), L (right) keys. They also put the only FN key to the right of the space bar. I have to use my pinky to hold the FN and use my other fingers to attempt to use arrow keys like I would on a full or TKL keyboard. It's not comfortable and they could have easily shortened the space bar to add an FN key on the left side. What I ended up doing is setting it up in the software for the keyboard (Synapse) so that when I hold FN I use ASDF as arrow keys. I would have done WSAD because that feels obvious and natural but they are already set as FN keys and you cannot remap them. Not a breaking point but it would have been nice to have a right side FN key.",
          "Its a GREAT keyboard for a lot of things but of course primarily gaming. its a TRULY AMAZING KEYBOARD if you get the red switches (linear switches) because purple (clicky) is to rattly on the space bar but the reds are a nice quiet fast switch but either way (if you like a clicky sound) still an amazing keyboard would absolutely recommend.",
          "I'm not exaggerating, it literately stopped working in around 5 minutes. I had it plugged into my desktop and the lights turned off after just a few minutes. I thought maybe my computer went to sleep, nope. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in on both ends of the usb cable nothing and lights wouldn't come back on. Tried another usb C to A cable, didn't work. Took it and plugged it into my Razer Blade laptop and nothing. The keyboard feels and sounds great, but considering it didn't last for me beyond 10 minutes I can't call it good which sucks because the typing feels and sounds great! So for now, I've plugged back in my reliable $15 Walmart keyboard.Next day editAfter fiddling with it some more it would seem the usb c port on the keyboard is where the problem is. I can get Windows to detect the keyboard if I wiggle the plugged in cable provided but it rapidly connects and disconnects and the lights on the keyboard flash. It doesn't stay on long enough for Windows to set it up. So I'm not sure if this is a quality or shipping issue, but either way still disappointing. I also tried multiple other usb cables and they didn't help. I actually had better luck with the cable provided, but still not enough to get it to stay on.After Service RMAIncreasing rating after contacting Razer support and working with them to get a RMA replacement. The replaced keyboard works great and I love it! The keyboard is precise, quiet and quick! I would give this replaced keyboard 5 stars, but dropping just one star since the first one I got did fail almost instantly.",
          "Couldn't believe it, COIL WHINE.  Overall great form factor and I love the silent linear switches, really fun to type on, in silence.  And I even measured the EMI  field of this keyboard against Red Dragon, it came in less then 1 mv which is pretty good.  By comparison Red Dragon which is significantly cheaper, produces  up to 10 x EMI field depending on how many LED keys are lit.One of the problems with this keyboard is the coil whine.  I use premium components in my computer with a fan-less Seasonic Prime power supply and Noctua fans running in low RPM mode.  My system is dead silent.  Except for the high pitch coil whine that is coming from this keyboard at full brightness, it's a total buzz kill.  However with brightness tuned down 50% the high pitch sound does go away or is noticeably reduced.Also there is no tilda key on this keyboard, which makes it a serious handicap for Linux users.  I've never realized how much I rely on arrow keys until I used this keyboard. It does put a serious snag into my workflow.  However there is a cumbersome workaround using function keys and JKLI keys instead, the problem is that holding the function key and typing JKLI with one hand is incredibly unintuitive.",
          "Feels awesome, smaller size is great for gaming",
          "Looks great feels amazing. This is my first 60% keyboard and for the price I highly recommend it.",
          "First off, this is a great product overall and is a stark difference from a traditional, non-mechanical, wireless keyboard.  Very happy with the purchase and the product as a whole.  It is very responsive and I have noticed a big improvement while gaming - even typing this review is more enjoyable with the Razer red linear optical switches!That said, I did have a couple of defects with mine and had to request an exchange - I would expect this case was an exception as I have been very happy with my Razer Mamba Wireless mouse and have heard generally favorable things about Razer products.  If you came here wondering if you should get it, I would say to go for it if it checks all the boxes for your needs in a mechanical and/or 60% keyboard.For those curious about my issue/experience, read on...after the first time using the keyboard, I noticed the \"U\" key was lit up white instead of the RGB lighting I customized in Synapse (cycled through a few light settings to check).  I was not able to fully isolate the issue, but mainly noticed it while playing Apex Legends.  I have all in game lighting affects turned off so it doesn't sync with games so I am not sure what the issue was.  After booting/waking up my PC, the keyboard is fine, or when waking the keyboard after it times out (setup for timeout after 5 minutes).  I also noticed it while playing Warzone the next day.  My other issue was a bit more concerning, but less \"severe\": 3 keycaps were partially not shining through with the back lighting - a very blatant QA issue that should not happen with a product at this price point.  The \"e\" on the \"esc\" key, the \"b\" on the \"tab\" key and the \"p\" on the \"caps\" key all had black spots that were blocking light from shining through.  I took off the \"esc\" keycap and saw some black plastic in the corner stuck beneath the white/clear coating (below the thin, black top of the key is a clear/white layer for the shine through on the letters/numbers/symbols whereas the edges are the thicker black plastic).  I have included a picture of the underside of the problem keycaps.  I gently tried to nudge the black plastic off as not to break the keycap, but it wouldn't budge.  The \"tab\" and \"caps\" keys have a square of the clear/white coating completely chipped away.  Not sure how that is resulting in the blocked light unless the clear/white coating diffuses the light, but it does look slightly different than the \"esc\" keycap defect.  I ended up chatting with Razer support and was told I needed to open an exchange with the reseller.  Not the answer I was hoping for, but I guess I wasn't really sure what to expect in the first place (sending me 3 new keycaps seems cost prohibitive and does not seem as effective of a solution - especially if the lighting on the \"U\" key persists).  Already have the exchange confirmed with Amazon and will send the defective one back ASAP.  Overall seemingly minor issues, but disappointing given the price point and overall reputation of this brand.",
          "I have been a fan of razer products for a long time because honestly their hypershift functionality hasn't been able to beat anything in my mind. Having another set of keys within the same hand mapping just by pressing another button on my mouse is so convenient since I mainly play shooting games. The issue I have with this keyboard specifically is that the hypershift button also activates the function keys. Razer synapse also doesn't let you remap this so there's no real way around it. On the Hunstman mini specifically, the \"w\" key is mapped to the \"windows volume up\" function key so when you're trying to move forward in game, you're stuck changing the volume instead which essentially screws you in a pvp match. Can you train yourself to not pressing the hypershift key while moving forward? Sure. But you should also be able to remap a keyboard that's advertised as remappable. I also get that they had to move those keys somewhere since it's a smaller board but why did it have to be the \"wasd\" keys of all things?Other than that issue, the keyboard still feels great. Since it's a smaller profile, it takes up less space on my desk. Keys feel great and responsive. Audible but not too noisy like other keyboards (personal preference). RGB is bright and vibrant. It's everything you'd expect from a razer product. But if the hypershift functionality is a big reason for why you like razer products, and desk real estate isn't as big of an issue for you, I would stick with their bigger keyboards.",
          "Really great small form keyboard. I am pleasantly surprised!Silky smooth typing experience and great responsiveness when gaming. Not much key \"wiggle\" they feel nice and solid and make a good (but soft) sound when typing on them. Nice actuation and they are quiet (Linear optical switches). Well worth the money for this. It's amazing once you realize you don't have to move your arm so far to get to/from your mouse!"

If you're looking for a good gaming keyboard for PUBG. This is the one. Not so much for typing, but you could it's only draw back it is sensitive for typing hence the dual keyboard setup. Highly recommended for PUBG.",
          "I've used this keyboard for a little over 2 and a half weeks now, let's talk about what's good about it first.the optical switches are quite smooth and are quite light, not an annoying light like razer's yellow switches, but like a perfect light. the keycaps are quite a nice feeling, they aren't that gross sweaty feeling that abs give you after a bit, the sound damping does work well, and it's not as loud as it would have been if you didn't have it. the wrist rest is comfy, not great like the Blackwidow elites but it's fine. now let's talk about what I don't like. the wrist rest makes this horrible creaking noise with almost every movement I make with my wrists, the stabs are dry and loud, lighting on some of the keycaps isn't too great, oh and one more thing before I talk about the switches, I really don't see a reason why they have stabs. they could have been mx style optical switches like gaterons, but it's this weird design that's pretty scary to those who are new to mechanical keyboards, do NOT believe what reviewers tell you, these keys wobble like any other keyboard. the stabs do absolutely nothing but make more noise for the keypress, which brings me to the WORST thing about this keyboard, the rattle. every. single. key. rattles like if it's a dry dehydrated spacebar. EVERY KEY DOES THIS. and it's annoying as all hell. even though the sound is obnoxious i still think this keyboard is a nice buy, it is nice to type on.",
          "Plays for hours",
          "Let me start by saying that this keyboard is a MUST for anyone!  It is absolutely the best thing I have put my fingers on in quite a while......LOLFor the last 3 months I have been on the hunt for a keyboard that would meet all my crazy criteria...and I finally found it.First, some background:  I am a software engineer and have been writing code and working at a desk in front a keyboard for the last 27 years, so a keyboard (and mouse) is my tool for the trade.In addition, I am extremely picky. More than just for the purpose of creature comforts, I look for \"utility\" in my tech and for things to be solid, good quality and made in a logical way.For a keyboard, I had this list of criteria:1. Backlit keys2. Quiet keys3. Primary dedicated media buttons that do NOT require a Fn/secondary key to be pressed for access.4. Easy volume controls5. Quiet keys6. Solid build that does not bend down with each key press7. Multi-colors for the backlit keys, if possible8. Quiet keys9. Mechanical-style keys (height and actuation)10. Properly spaced keys11. Quiet keys12. \"Linear\" Enter key (not \"L\" shape.....why...why?)Did I mention Quiet keys???  That actually should have been at the top of the list.I know it is a personal preference, and mine is not the clicky noise...it's just too distracting to me.Well, folks - this is it!  This is the keyboard that answers ALL the criteria above.To date, I have tried over 20 keyboards and none hit the mark. I've tried cheap ones, medium and expensive ones.  Couldn't find it until this.The keys are made of a nice material that provides just that little \"grip\" you need not to slide off of the surface.Actuation is amazing and the bottom of the key press is dampened (noise-side) in such a nice way that you can barely hear it. I really do mean barely!!SO many reviews and manufacturer write-ups talk about quiet keys...but they were not.This keyboard is absolutely that - quite and pleasant (if you can even say that).Keys are spaced out nicely and typing accuracy is very high.I particulary like the fact that I can set RGB values for the backlit color of the keys...that's just excellent.The software that gets installed by Razer is very good as well. Intuitive and gives you super control over every aspect of the keyboard.I've only had this keyboard ONE day, and already love it. If I think about it, I will return in 30 days and add an update.Price - I wasn't too \"comfortable\" with spending that type of cash for a keyboard...but now that it's here and I am typing this review with it...it was worth every penny!  You DO get what you pay for.If you are in the market - spend the extra dollars and get this!  You will NOT be disappointed!!!  :)",
          "It's very quiet which my wife appreciated compared to my mechanical. Ghost key caps upgrade should have come stock instead of additional for the price of this keyboard.It was very quiet initially but now it makes a weird squishy noise on the wsda, l shift, l Ctrl. Etc. That are used consistently while gaming.It's ok. Expected better quality though for the price.",
          "The keyboard performs well, is fairly comfortable as a non-ergonomic keyboard, and is quieter than my BlackWidow TE Chroma v2 TKL I bought back in 2019.In the description pictures of the product the text on the keyboard caps is just as small, neat and beautiful as on my blackwidow, but what I received was this, well, this disappointment. I think for this price the keyboard should have been looking even more beautiful, but alas - some uneven lighting, on the enter key and some other, the letters are HUGE and in some keys like the prtsc - the text is literally ON the edge of the keycap.I really want this keyboard, I like how it sounds and feels, but sadly I can't stand to look at it.I think I will either look into another keyboard similar to this, or get a replacement hoping it'll be a quality keyboard this time...",
          "Honestly I think this is one of the best keyboards I've ever owned. The keystrokes are so smooth and comfortable, with a minor click at the bottom. It's very quiet as well, being BARELY audible with my headset on, with no audio playing of course. Can't even be picked up by my microphone over discord, which sits directly above my keyboard. The material the keys are made of feels great to me as well, and the wrist wrest is just as comfortable. Well worth the purchase.",
          "The sound of the keyboard is on point, very aesthetic and has a very nice color to it. Only very small noticeable problem for gaming is the keys are a little high but very easy to press down.",
          "This keyboard is QUALITY. The switches and keys feel mechanical, not in a click-click way (it's smooth and quiet), but rather in a way that feels solid. There's a certain heft and weight to it--it's not all plastic. The keys pop back up so fast, reliably, and solidly. I love it so much--it makes me want to type even when I have no reason to. I also have a SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL, and imo, this is a much much better keyboard.",
          "There is a lot to like about this keyboard. It is smooth and silent. The build quality feels like a keyboard in the price range. The wrist wrest is comfortable and fatigue is next to nothing. The optical switches are great for gaming and while it is not clicky, adjusting to the actuation point is smooth and zero phantom strokes.  The spacing feels a little closer than the Corsair, but not by much. Media keys are great and the wheel is nice and low profile on the side. Size is comparable to the K70 and fits on my tray without problem.Couple of thing you should know before you buy. 1) There is no USB/media passthrough. It does only take up one usb slot on your computer, but if you utilized it before, you will not with this keyboard. 2) I wish the media wheel did more. It works fine for volume and mute, but setting up anything else takes some work and there is not a lot there that really makes it anymore than that. 3) And this is a big OCD thing. The magnetic wrist wrest does not physically attach to the keyboard. So if you reposition the keyboard, you have to reposition the wrist wrest, and even if you don't, there is not left/right stabilization. 4) Unless you are changing the color of the keycaps, pudding/phantom keycaps will not illuminate around the key. The LED is located at the top of the optical switch.All and all it's an amazing keyboard. At the price point, you are really comparing it to the K100. It does not have the bells and whistles, at least outside the software, but the tying experience is smoother in a smaller footprint.",
          "So I purchased the Blackwidow v3 and Huntsman Elite a few days ago, and realized I liked the Huntsman a lot more. I then realized there was a v2 of the Huntsman, so I was like \"Surely I'd want the v2, it's $100 more expensive so it must be better...\"There are numerous qualities about this keyboard (v2) that I do not like when compared to the Elite (we'll call it v1).The 1st picture is of the v1 (Huntsman Elite) and the 2nd picture is of the v2. It's not quite as obvious in the pictures, but the LEDs on the keys are simply not as good. The text on the keycaps is larger on the keys above the arrows, and just looks really bad when compared to the Elite. The LEDs do not fully light up the words like \"home\" and \"pause\" so 'aus' is significantly brighter than the 'p___e'. It looks worse in person than in my pictures.The mechanical keys themselves do not sound as nice or feel as good to use on the v2. (I purchased clicky optical on both keyboards.)The keycaps on the v2 are textured whereas the v1 is smooth. I don't really mind textured keycaps, but the finish is pretty aggressive if that makes sense... it doesn't feel nice to the touch.The wrist wrest on the v2 is 'attached' with magnets and doesn't light up. It wiggles around a lot more if you're moving the keyboard back and forth. (I eat on this desk so I'm pushing the keyboard away, for example) The Elite uses 2 USBs (1 to power the wrist wrest I assume) which is a downside, but ultimately I'm not using all of my USB ports anyways so it's not an issue for me.I'm very happy with the Huntsman Elite, and pleased that I'm saving $100 after looking at the v2. (though I wish the Elite had the same larger/flatter volume knob, but I'll get over it lol)",
          "Wow this keyboard is unbelievable!The picture is not how the keyboard comes, i put on some custom keycaps.This keyboard, with the red linear switches, is incredible, seriously. I love everything about it, the lighting is awesome with help from chroma, the keys are perfect for gaming and even make the ever so desired thocc sound! Every keystroke feels just as smooth as the last. The actuation distance and distance it takes to register a press is perfectly tuned and i love it. The keys manage to press in smoothly without feeling squishy. I highly recommend this keyboard, especially if you are fine with getting it used, which is what i did. I got this keyboard practically brand new for $100!! Literally the only difference is that it probably wont come in the original box.",
          "I've had this keyboard for a few months and use this primarily for work.  Since working remote I've been using the Logitech Wave Ergo Keyboard (because it was cheap) but started getting tired of mushy and loud keys.  I've never had a mechanical keyboard before nor did I know they existed.  I spent a long time doing my research trying to figure out what I wanted and settled on red switches.  My boyfriend has a Razer BW with green switches but it's so loud that I can hear it from across the room even with a tv on full blast.  Linear reds seemed to be the best for what I needed because I like having a quiet space to work from home.I honestly laughed when reading reviews that said they were the key presses were \"smooth,\" \"buttery,\" and \"satisfying\" but boy people were right!  It's relatively quiet and the sound isn't so annoying like the Logitech Wave.  I've also taken this to my office if I need to be on site in an open space.  I was worried about the sound but no one has said anything to me.  There was a bit of a learning curve because the keys need less force so I would press a key on accident.I think I went overboard as I'm not a PC gamer and don't need things like macros (but might use for work) but I liked having the option to have RGB lighting so my desk doesn't look so drab and like other reviews have said it's not as bright and there are a couple of keys where it's dim.As much as I would like to buy another one to have at my physical office location I can't justify the price point but overall I'm pretty happy with it.Other thoughts:Magnetic writstrest is a plusRazer software could be better",
          "In general, I like the keyboard a lot. The clicky switches sound great and the LEDs are beautiful! I don't personally like the matte-esque finish on the keys (feels gross on my nails), but that's easily rectified by swapping keycaps. The one thing about this keyboard I see being a problem for some is the metal pinging sound from every single key. The sound happens when you press the keys with any kind of force, and the only way to avoid it is to press down gently and slowly--and no one in existence types like that. If you use headphones or often listen to audio through speakers, you probably won't hear it, so I can tolerate it. But it's something to note, especially if you're really picky.",
          "I have owned various Razor keyboards and mice over the years and up until now I have loved every one of them.Size: This is not something that is obvious by this is NOT a normal full size keyboard. This will impact your gaming skill because your fast twitch finger muscles are not going to be used to the change in layout. It also seems counter intuitive to have a keyboard be so small width wise and then remain so long depth wise. If you are looking for a keyboard for a small space think again, because the depth is going to likely pose more of a problem for you than the width saving gains you. 3 Stars.Ergonomic: This keyboard does not really have any ergonomic option other than having a magnetic wrist rest. The rest is ok; however this is far from the most comfortable keyboard I have ever had. 2 Stars.Technology: I have owned and used this keyboard over several months now. It is the first keyboard that I have had to literally unplug and re-plug, multiple times now because the keyboard will stop working (even through a reboot). By stop working there are two different problems. The keys actually stop registering but the lights work, or the lights stop working but the keys work. For a premium product like Razor this is far below what we have come to expect from a quality standpoint. 1 Star",
          "Personally I love the keyboard. There's nothing wrong with it; but there's nothing seriously great about it neither in comparison to other options. The price tag can probably be explained by the shortage, supply chain, lockdown and on and on.After received the keyboard, tho, I finally understood why there's keycap upgrade option because the default keycaps are so HIDEOUS (especially for a keyboard that shines, literally, with great backlits) that those default keycaps definitely do not match up with a, like what, $200 price tag.Again, great keyboard, no complains except the one above. If you do care for looks (especially it's a pricy keyboard MEANT for the backlits), get the keycap upgrades, and then burn the default keycaps in a can, or something.",
          "I like it. I love that I can customize the key actions. I switched my control key to caps lock without needing autohotkey, which works even across remote desktop sessions. Typing is enjoyable. It's not really loud. Great.",
          "I originally got this Razer keyboard (linear optical as a secondary compliment to a Logitech G915 TKL wireless/wired keyboard, since the G915 TKL is thinner.But the more I got used to this Razer keyboard, the less I wanted to use the G915 because of how responsive the Razer keyboard is.According to RTINGS, the input latency (which is the time it takes for a keystroke to be registered) between both G915 and Razer Huntsman v2 keyboards are as follows:G915:Latency Wired 1.3 msLatency Receiver 1.9 msLatency Bluetooth 8.9 msRazer Huntsman v2:Latency Wired 0.5 msLatency Receiver N/ALatency Bluetooth N/AThe 0.5 ms is definitely noticeable, especially when you set the Keyswitch Optimization to \"gaming mode\" within the Razer Synapse software, which removes the \"button debounce\". The alternative mode to gaming mode is called \"Typing mode\" which introduces a debounce delay to prevent extra inputs from being registered (to prevent typos).I use it with 1000hz polling rate. Anything higher like the advertized 8000hz is not really necessary, especially the extra load that the CPU will experience at that level. You may have a few typos as you get used to the feel of the key presses, but once you lock it in, it is going to be very hard to go back to any other keyboard except this.I also use it without the wrist rest just fine while on a Uplift desk. With a wrist-rest, it's fine also, but I don't like the idea of having to constantly reposition the wrist rest whenever I move the keyboard, since it's not attached.Overall, if you want a competitive edge, with PBT keys that last, with a TKL form-factor, with an optional wrist-rest, don't hesitate to buy this. Download and install Razer Synapse so you can configure the keyboard.",
          "Replaced my Razer Blackwidow Elite with this beauty. 100% enjoy the speed, responsiveness, and lower noise from this keyboard than the blackwidow. The only thing better on the blackwidow elite is the palm rest. The one that comes with this keyboard is too soft and and flat. So, I just use my blackwidow palm rest with this keyboard",
          "I enjoy this keyboard very much. I do miss the extra USB ports on my old black widow. The keys are very nice, but the darker colors almost don't show up if there are any lights on in the room.",
          "\u00a0Main thing about this keyboard is the improved acoustics, right?They wear off easily. The most used keys will start sounding entirely different.Very fast response, I had to develop the muscle memory to not lay my thumb on the spacebar because I was accidentally jumping and giving my position away in games.Lighting is pretty good. Not the brightest razer keyboard, and some a couple of keys (left alt, b) aren't evenly lit due to the keycap's design.Still, best spacebar, enter, and backspace keys I've ever touched. By far quieter than other linear keyboard in the same price range. By comparison, the Apex Pro is like banging the desk with a hammer.If you got this on a sale it wouldn't be a waste of money. If you're here for a linear keyboard, this is it. If you're here for lighting, maybe others will have more impressive lighting, but the customizability on Razer's lineup is unmatched. If you're here for QUIET MECHANICAL keyboards, this is probably the best big brand one you can get (even with the uneven response), but do take a look at custom keys.",
          "It's great, it came pretty week packaged, smooth and great to the tactile touch, but I was expecting a little bit more of bright on the RGB, I guess it's related to our own preferences or sth, but overall a great keyboard",
          "This is the nicest keyboard i have ever touched in my life. the key strokes are so soft and precise. i can type silent if i go slow enough. the membrane on the v2 is amazing and the linear optical (red switches) are like straight hot butter to type with. feels amazing. the chroma is super cool too way more customization than i realized. I wish the wrist rest had a stronger magnet in it or at least a catch so that i can't slide side to side on the keyboard... but still 9.9/10 for that.i got it 10% but would totally pay full price. very worth it. I've had a ton of keyboards and this wins.",
          "My Logitech keyboard died a week before Thanksgiving. In an effort to escape Logitech's software (and modern hardware quality control), I decided to give the Razer Huntsman V2 (w/ Razer Red switches) a chance.Sure, it's not a custom mechanical setup with exotic Japanese switches, but it gives a premium enough feel. I love the sound dampening, the smoothness of the keys, and the relatively short actuation distance. It's not silent, per se, but it's the quietest keyboard in my house (including various laptops).I've seen comments online suggesting the keys don't light up bright enough. I'm partial to more subdued keyboard lighting, and I can vouch for the fact that I haven't had to dim the board much. Other brands use lighting that glows substantially around the keys, instead of just through the letters. Some of Razer's marketing images show bright halos around the keys, and some show none at all. In practice, they glow a little at the top of each key, but not very much at all.The only serious downside I encountered was with Razer's software. It's not very intuitive in general. But my specific complaint is that it isn't easy to use external tools to switch game profiles. I really wish these hardware companies would open source their software!Now, for why I returned it in a week. The Huntsman V2 Analog popped up on sale over Black Friday weekend for only a few buck more than I spent. I figured it was a no-brainer upgrade--how wrong I was.The analog version has added lighting around the base of the board (it looks great!) and offers analog functionality on every single key. Plus it has slightly stiffer springs. Unfortunately, it has none of the sound dampening of the regular Huntsman V2, and the keys give a loud, drum-like clack when bottomed out or rebounding.Analog, on a keyboard, is a bit of a gimmick, but one cool thing the analog version offers is adjustable actuation points. This gives you the ability to tune your typing and gaming experience.I agonized over the stiffer springs and loud typing. Ultimately, I returned the regular, quiet Huntsman V2 in favor of keeping the loud, but adjustable, Huntsman V2 Analog. Though I very seriously considered keeping both!!",
          "Best mechanical keyboard I've used.  Almost completely silent, with the linear switches.  Feels amazing for gaming or typing.But do your research.  There are a bunch of different versions.  Get the gen2 switches, they're the latest and are really nice.  And IMO avoid the analog version.  It's more expensive, and the analog feature has a lot of mixed reviews.  I don't know if the switches are identical otherwise, as I've only used the gen2 optical switches.  I'm considering getting a Tartarus Pro that comes with the V2 analog switches though, and I'll update this review with my thoughts on that if I end up buying it.*Update*I did get the Tartarus Pro, as well as another Huntsman V2 TKL for a different PC in my house.  That's how much I liked it.  The Tartarus Pro is very similar.  It's not as quiet, a bit more clicky, but still well within the category of quiet mechanical switches.  I think it has a tad more key travel, but otherwise is very similar to the Huntsman V2.  It's not something everyone would find useful but I'm liking it.  Anyway, if you're debating between the V2 linear switches and the V2 analog, I would lean towards the standard linear switch.  The added functionality you get from the analog seems kinda useless to me.  It's really a no contest kind of decision unless you are very very sure that the analog feature is something you can't live without.",
          "I used to be a Logitech junky but their quality went down the tank. Bought this keyboard and a naga mouse. Durability is great. Keys took getting used to no issues. Love the easier cleaning of dog hair build up between keys. Only beef would be the music knobs in top right don't illimate the buttons just underneath so can't tell which does what in dark.",
          "I originally got the K100 and absolutely hated it. It was by far the loudest and ugliest sounding keyboard I'd ever heard and the keys were way too sensitive. I returned it and got this instead, mainly because I'm already using a Razer mouse and this has sound dampening.It's fantastic! Easy to type on, VERY quiet, and a nice build quality. The wrist rest is amazingly comfortable and attached super easily with magnets to the keyboard.My only complaint about the keyboard, which isn't a big deal but still annoying, is the consistency of the lighting. A few keys are a little brighter than others. The F keys tend to be darker, and the Windows key is super bright for some reason. I think this is because of the font used on the keys allowing varying levels of light through. The K100 had nicer light than this.However, at the end of the day I care far more about comfort, sound, and typing/keys than lighting, so I'm much happier with this than the K100, plus it was cheaper.",
          "Its very comfortable with the leather rest. I bought the clicky keys by accident. They are not dampened at all. I had a Razor back widow elite series but the wrist rest wore really bad on my left had due to Iwatch. That is the only reason i upgraded. It still works and looks like new. I do like this keypad though. Love the entertainment right-hand upper section for music while gaming. Its great! Overall i love it. The wrist rest feels awesome and is square instead of tapered so it really fits well. Im bumbed i didn't get the type with RGB around the outer edges of the wrist rest. I thought i did. Their web page makes you think you're getting everything the video says. But your not, unless you happen to choose those options which they dont have on this amazon page. Also its not near as bright as Blackwidow. So taking a star for that. Otherwise same best gaming gear ever.",
          "Tactile clicky yet very quiet!Compare to razor green switches, it has a shorter travel and requires less force",
          "I don't dislike or hate this keyboard; it's just expensive for what you get.Logitech has better features (better battery for their wireless models, and much better mice), but for whatever reason, always use low-profile key switches.I went with the \"tactile\", non-clicky key switches, and the optical sensor is so sensitive, that resting your hands on the keys will sometimes cause a miskey. So, it took a little getting used to. That said, if you're playing games with it, perhaps the sensitivity is desired.The cable is a decent length, but you're not going to run it across a room (and don't bother with their wireless keyboards), the customization options are mostly decent, but the software is clunky, and they don't allow key re-mapping for certain keys (which is silly).I wanted to disable the Windows Key for gaming, or to re-map, but was unable to. You are about to disable or re-map and create profiles (where the Synapse software is supposed to recognize running apps and switch between keyboard profiles), but I've yet to have that work.The media keys are okay, but it would've been nice to have some Logitech-style macro buttons on the left side for gaming.The lighting array is really hit-or-miss. I don't like pulsing rainbows, and opted to simply backlight the keys with as-close-to-white backlight as possible. Some of the lighting seems uneven and not particularly bright. It's just not as clean as even my decade-old Logitech K800.Would I pay $200 again? Probably not. Maybe for ~$160, it's not such a bad deal. I just wish Logitech would embrace taller key caps.",
          "Do I like it? Yes. Is it perfect? No.The good-It's quiet. I much prefer the muted keys. I don't need my neighbors knowing that I'm typing something- They added the shift keys,  ie !?@#, to the back lighting. The original had those as a normal painted on color, aka you can't see them in the dark like the rest of the keysThe bad- They removed the chroma hand rest. The original had a magnetized hand rest that had the usual chroma effects that they slap on everything. This one just has a regular hand rest that sits in front of the keyboard, doesn't even attach to it. I don't even use them, but it's still points off for removing a nice feature- They moved the cord from the middle to the far left side. Now the cord doesn't fit neatly underneath my razer sound bar, like it was originally designed to do. Now I have to shift my keyboard to the left and the sound bar to the right so it can go around the side, making my entire display off center. Not to mention my pc is on the right, so now the cord can't reach my cable bundle, so it's just dangling a few inches away from it- No macro keys. The original didn't have them either, but it's still annoying. Don't know why they stopped including those on all their keyboards.",
          "Overall the keyboard is pretty awesome.Gaming was a 5/5 because the switches are quiet and creamy, easy to press and responsive (maybe a little TOO responsive)Ergonomic was a 4/5 because my hand like to hover above the lower left hand side of the keyboard and ctrl keycap has a sharp edge and likes to poke at my palm sometimes.Brightness was a 4/5 because it's not as bright as I'd like and there are some shady areas on the keycaps RGB lighting on the top right hand side of the keyboard, I noticed the same shady areas on the blackwidow v2 that I had as well.But after all said and done, it's compact, leaves me enough room on the desk, sounds great, responsive, RGB has endless colors and has some really good patterns (The ambient lighting is my favorite) and other features you get from Razer Synapse lets you make sure that you know that this keyboard is yours.",
          "I like the TKL layout...it gives me more room on my station.Comparing it to my Razer Huntsman Elite:CONS: The LEDs are not near as bright and vivid, but are okay.  I hate the fact that the wrist rest doesn't attach in some way (like magnetic).  The CAPS lock lights up White when pressed.  Would rather have a separate LED.  Why? Because if you happen to want your keys illuminated White...it is confusing.  I can't seem to change this in the settings.  The Scroll Locks does this as well.PROS:  The secondary symbols on the top row are illuminated (like they always should've been).",
          "Box was a little messed up and the tape was off. Looks new, but is a gift for my kid so I am going to wrap it for christmas and hope for the best.",
          "Works Great! Just got this keyboard and it works great.",
          "I love a lot of things about the keyboard, but this is a critical post ONLY about the keycaps. For a $200 keyboard they should not be splotchy and it looks an awful lot like they intentionally limit the brightness of the LEDs so you don't notice how the keycaps have problems with the consistency of the light that comes through them (due to the splotchy plastic underneath).So my guess is instead of addressing the problem, they decided to cover it up. Either there is a manufacturing problem or bad QA. I'm not a fan of overly bright LEDs and the brightness is 'just' good enough for me, however it's hard to imagine that's maximum brightness in this day and age. The volume knob brightness is also brighter then the keys, which my guess is they accidentally didn't limit the brightness of it to match the keys. Once again, $200 keyboard, this shouldn't be treated like a $50 board.Other things that are annoying:Onboard profiles do not remember color settings, still, without Synapse open and running.No dedicated button to change the active profile without using Synapse, yet there is a macro button that works without Synapse.The wrist rest is too high compared to the bottom edge of the keyboard. This means your fingers dip down and in to reach the lowest row. This is due to the height of the wrist rest base plate.",
          "Completely customizable for all keys, wrist rest and such an easy set up. Very pleased..",
          "Feels perfect. I got the silent keys, very happy with them. Great response time, great feel. I did have alot of trouble with the software and the customer service is rough, they get back to you quick, but not very helpful.  I finally got it to work after reinstalling several times, now the illumination features work great.",
          "Got this as a gift for my boyfriend to replace his older Razer keyboard, he loves the buttons on the top right to adjust volume for when he listening to music. Just a really good keyboard in my opinion.",
          "Damn! I did not believe the V2 was going to be a huge difference from the V1 in terms of sound but it sure as heck is! If you are needing a good quiet keyboard and fedup with all the quiet keyboards you purchased sounding loud, try out the Huntsman V2! Definitely its best feature.",
          "\u00a0I honestly did not need another keyboard but since I already have the Razer Enki chair, blackshark v2 pro wireless, and the deathadder v3 pro. I decided to get this keyboard as well. I will say this, the stock key caps on the huntsman v2 tkl make the rgb lights a bit dim. Mine looks bright because I switched the caps with steelseries prismcaps. I could of gotten the phantom caps but I prefer the prismcaps a bit more. Overall this keyboard met my expectations and replaced my steelseries Apex pro tkl wireless.",
          "This is by far the best keyboard I have ever used.",
          "Replaced an old huntsman keyboard that still worked just fine... I made the mistake first time of buying clicky keys and wanted to get quiet keys.  This keyboard has a more pleasing matte texture, has a nice wrist support, and only uses 1x usb unlike the huntsman elite v1 that I had before that used 2 usb's.  This time went with linear/quiet keys, and its much nicer (i use my keyboard for work and play and the clicky isn't great for conference calls/meetings). Would buy again.",
          "I got this specifically for the Gen 2 optical linear switches. They feel great for a stock keyboard switch and they actually make the keyboard pretty quiet compared to other mechanical switches I've used in the past (cherry blue, brown, black). Overall the keyboard is great and exactly what you expect.The only major downside (and this one is a pretty annoying downside) is that there is ZERO RGB effect control from the keyboard itself. It will only do the default color cycle unless you install Razer software on your PC. AFAIK it's the only keyboard that's like this. If you get literally ANY other RGB keyboard like keychron or whatever, it's controlled from the keyboard through the hardware itself instead of through software. This means you probably can't control it on Linux which is really annoying.",
          "I\u2019ve been using my keyboard a couple months now and it\u2019s absolutely amazing for gaming. I love how well the switching actuate and how quiet they are.I will say it\u2019s a little different when trying to actually type in it, but I\u2019ve noticed it being a little harder with all gaming switches that typing is a little bit of a struggle compared to some super clicky blues or something.I\u2019ve been away from Razor for some time, but came back to try this keyboard and their mouse for the 8k polling rates. No regrets with either purchase!While I think their media controls are a little lacking, and the volume wheel is a bit inconvenient compared to how Corsair has their media layout, this isn\u2019t a deal breaker.Last but not least, I\u2019m not a fan that gaming mode doesn\u2019t have dedicated buttons on keyboard even if tiny. I think you can set them in software as hot key combos but I always forget those! I\u2019ll have to work on that.For now though, these will be my go to for gaming until something better comes along and reduces even more input lag!",
          "Got it for my boyfriend and he loves it! The lights are amazing.",
          "I had this keyboard for all of 12 hours so I can only give so much feedback. While it definitely had a premium feel to it and a pleasant (and very quiet for a mechanical keyboard!) typing experience, it just wasn't for me.I use a KVM to switch between my home PC and my work laptop. When I saw from the product description that it had on-board memory I thought that meant it would be fine making the transition between the two.What Razer needs to make crystal clear in their advertising is that its on-board memory is for macros ONLY. It does NOT carry through lighting profiles, and the keyboard apparently has no capability to store a default lighting look. The moment that it loses connection with the Synapse software it defaults back to the moving rainbow color scheme. This was distracting for while I was trying to work so back in the box it went!My understanding is this is pretty much the case across the board with all Razer keyboards, so if you're looking for something that can easily move between 2 computers.. they aren't the brand for you."

          "I'm writing to clarify the contents of the box and adapters. The \"Kraken\" headset comes with a fixed 3.5mm TRRS 4 pole plug and an adapter to split the mic and speaker. So, if you have a computer that only has USB and no 3.5mm, you will need to buy an adapter (3.5mm to USB).I have been using this for a language program on my computer only (no gaming console).",

It took my sister calling me asking if we were okay because a trained crashed so close to us. I didn\u2019t hear even the slightest noise from that.

          "Works as it should with the Xbox. Sound is clear. Well worth the money.",
          "This headset is a great replacement for my turtle beach 600 max gen 2, which was a great headset too I broke it by accident so this one is just I needed and the sound is also good for me since the xbox has low volume rate when gaming at a higher volume.",
          "Kraken as a brand is known for making quality products that are functional, comfortable, and durable. The noise cancelling earpieces do a good job blocking out sound, and keeping your ears warm.The product comes as two separate parts: The audio controller (USB to 3.5) and the headset itself, which has a 3.5mm jack that plugs in at a 90 degree angle. I'll talk about the headset first.The headset uses quality fabric from top to bottom, a synthetic leather on top of the headband, with a more cushioned, lattice pattern fabric on bottom. The padding is very breathable and comfortable, so you don't need to worry about the headset slipping off when using them, barring the most excessive headbanging.The foam they use is a very soft, flexible kind of foam, so you don't need to worry about having the earpieces bite into any eyewear you are wearing. The extendable microphone has a soft arm, which means you can bend it to get the perfect angle for any face.Additionally, the audio quality is great for general use, meaning you'll get a good quality mic whether you're using it on console, PC or even mobile. When not in use, the microphone can be pushed back into the headset frame, making it very much out of your way when you're trying to enjoy some music.The headset has a barebones, inline volume dial and mute toggle. Both have held up after extensive (+1 year) usage in tandem with the audio controller. The wire used is a not very thick, but dense enough braid, so you won't have to worry about wire crimping or getting tangled in a travel bag or other container.Before we get started talking about the audio controller I'm going to be talking about the hardware, not the software currently, as while Razer is amazing a producing a great product, the software is notorious for several issues. The audio controller is a very small profile box at the end of a braided cable with a USB plugin. The box has buttons to raise and lower volume in general, a mute button that glows red when muted, and for the two audio channels the drivers for the device (without the software) create; game and chat.The two channels have two small actuators that return to a neutral position after adjusting volume for the respective channel. Finally, the audio controller has a button to enable THX spatial audio.The headset is 5.1 compatible for anyone wondering, and that should be good enough to satisfy most everyone.The major downsides are typically Razer's software. Most of my issues with razer have been drivers following a patch, typically requiring you to go into settings for all apps using audio settings, or have certain features not work for all setups.Frequently the default THX audio settings don't work, and audio doesn't separate into the two channels properly. All audio funnels into the chat channel for me personally, but there have been anecdotes of people having no issues getting it working.Overall, great hardware, just don't expect the full functionality the software claims. Treat it as a fancy UI and a way to keep your drivers updated, and you'll be happy.",
          "Not bad headphones for my xbox. especially for $50+. They are on the Bass side and have no adjustemnt. But as I noted for $50 not bad.",
          "The hardware in the Krakens is excellent, imo.  My husband loves these phones (and I do, too!)  My previous phones, a pair of Sony MDR-7506's, were so good we thought nothing could beat them, even though the Sony phones' drivers are 40 mms in size and these Razer Kraken drivers are 50mm--much depends on the amplification hardware in the ear pads and motherboard hardware as to which will drive the better sound--eg., 50 mm drivers are not automatically better than 40mm drivers, regardless of the hardware environments.  A lot also depends on the preferences of the individuals asked to state their opinions, of course.  Some people like bass so overwhelming it actually distorts whereas other people like it only enough to hear it plainly with no distortion, and others like it turned down or off, inexplicably, etc.  (But you can't argue with individual opinions, right?...Opinions are like armpits--we all have at least two of them, eh? So, I advise listening to all sides and colors of opinions, especially about computer hardware!  There's always something new to learn even we don't agree with the overall opinions other people have or their conclusions. Opinions should always be debated--never, ever censored, we firmly believe!)Bear in mind, both sets of phones were tested via my husband's x570 Aorus Master motherboard's RealTek'HD Audio 3.5mm analog Hi-Definition front-panel jack--the best earphone connection jack in the system, btw.  (Give me wired over wireless any day--I hate batteries and frequency interference, not to mention security concerns that do not exist with wired connections, etc.)  The x570 Master also supports, in hardware, a 3-position headphone amp,  and a hardware DAC, a SABRE 9118 DAC--the combination has to be heard to be properly appreciated, imo.Connector cabling.  The Kraken offers a superior wiring connection--Kraken uses an extremely thin and ultra-flexible braided connector cable, whereas the Sony offers a thick, plastic-covered connection cable in which most of the length is coiled, just like analog amp cables circa the 1960's were made.  Indeed, the Sony cabling doesn't look like something made for a 3.5mm plug!  It looks exactly like something made for a full size plug!  It's opinion, sure, as everything always is in the end, but we much prefer the Kraken's cabling over that used in the Sony cans used as the baseline comparison for this review.  The Kraken cabling is ultralight, ultrathin, cloth braided, and so ultra-flexible that there simply isn't any obstinate stiffness in the cable that can be perceived.  We both like it very much because of that--it is the nearest thing to not having a cable at all,  but without any of the negatives of wireless.  Sony's cabling is--well--SoA, circa 1969...;)  Reminds my husband of plugging in his ancient but revered Gibson SG-Specials or Fender Strats & Telecasters into nice big onstage amps (which he still does, only the amps are a fair bit smaller, thankfully...;) )Razer Kraken has an inline volume and microphone control switch.  The Sony has neither--well, it doesn't have a microphone at all, so of course no Mic on/off switch.  The Kraken has a nice, radial volume control for the cans, and a straight on-off switch for the Mic.  Neither of us is a Mic user, so I'll leave that portion of the review to others better qualified to write about it in another review.  Suffice it to say the Mic works as advertised and the on/off inline switch works fine.Now for the optional DSP software.  Here's the situation as we think it stands regarding the extra-cost  surround software available for the Kraken, the THX Spatial Audio software for the Kraken.  We don't recommend anyone buying the Headphones without buying the offered THX Spatial Audio software!  It's offered at 50% off when you buy the Kraken Phones, by Razer.  So it's $10!  It's the best $10 you are going to spend for a long time.  We believe that these phones should not be offered sans the THX Spatial Audio--it's kind of baffling that they are offered without the custom THX software, frankly.  However, there are people who love distorted bass and volumes so loud that King Kong's eardrums would burst!...;) So maybe that's why Razer doesn't integrate this into this Kraken package.  Still, it would be unusual to find earphone wearers who would prefer their games sounding like an avalanche of boulders tumbling down the side of Everest. I think, anyway...;)To sum it up--I love this software.  Husband loves it.  He says it's much better than what he thought it might be.  Razer includes a 7.1 surround-sound software solution free of charge with the Kraken, and it's just \"OK\"--just kind of average--seems to induce a fair bit of bass distortion in speech in some of our games--one guy's speech is nigh unintelligible with the Razer 7.1 surround sound package for the Krakens. But run the THX Spatial Audio, instead,  and the difference is real and immediately noticeable.  THX really justifies its commercial claims--the software brings out the best in the Kraken hardware!Comfort.  It's a very important category with cans--as all of us know.  If you can't game for hours because your phones are causing you pain or discomfort after a certain wearing time--that's unacceptable.  These Kraken phones have \"Oval Cooling Gel Cushions\" in the pads and I'm just going to say that they are very comfortable indeed.  My husband says that this set is the most comfortable set of cans he's ever worn. Both of us think the Sony set tends to \"pinch\" a bit in a long wear.  The Sony pads are by no means uncomfortable, absolutely not. But both of us--my husband's typically swelled head and my petite but usually swifter smaller head both find the Krakens more comfortable in all wear scenarios--which I find a bit unusual.  My husband says that what surprises him about the Krakens in addition to the gel-filled ear pads is how comfortable they feel--even for a large head like his they feel like they've got more room to give--not something the Sony's ever did.  The Sony's were adequate, just not as comfortable.Durability. This is a big one for us, but especially for my husband.  He's gone through many Plasticine sets of cans promising great durability.  Hah.  We have lost count of the very strong-looking plastic-frame headsets that after very little use, comparatively, use that was anything but harsh or abusive,  simply fell apart, cracking through or breaking apart, and it happened over and over again.  Hence, the hunt for metal headbands and construction in our headphones.  Both the Sony and the Razer Kraken use metal in their construction, and what a difference!  Neither set has come close to cracking or breaking apart!  The Sony's have been up for years without a single problem in that regard! Years, literally.  We do not expect to see any less durability from our Razer Kraken--namely, the one reviewed in this article!Really, any aluminum-headband construction should suffice for a long, long time.  Our advice is to avoid plastic like the plague--especially the plastic headbands that appear to hold massive weight and hold up under enormous wear and tear--especially those particular Plasticine headbands....;)  They just aren't going to be there one day when you really need them.Price:  Believe it or not, the Sony cans are actually priced higher than the Kraken headset reviewed here. You can usually buy the Kraken Gaming Headset reviewed here plus the Razer THX Spatial Audio Software for less--that's right--less than what the MDR-7506 is currently selling for in places such as AMAZON! Where you are right now.Summary:  The Sony cans, the MDR-7506's used as a baseline comparison for the Razer Kraken Gaming Headset review here, deliver really nice sound and were our number 1 choice in gaming headphones.  Operative word being \"were\"....!  These Razer Kraken headphones are better, in our very humble, sincere opinions!",

          "My son loves these. I have purchased a dozen different gaming headphones for my rough and tumble child and these replace his previous lime green set that lasted the longest at 7 months.

          "I'm writing this review after using this headset almost daily for work and gaming for a little under two years now. I bought these for gaming, streaming, and work. Let me start off by saying they look adorable and seem to be sturdy, but the quality is definitely lacking and I generally wouldn't recommend them to anyone who is trying to use them as a full headset, maybe as just headphones, but definitely not if they need to use the mic.-------------Quick Summary-------------------------------------PROS: Cute, extension cord is handy (sometimes), comfortable enough to wear all day, sound quality is decent, separate volume knob on the headphones is convenient sometimesCONS: Mic quality is god awful, the mute button broke pretty quickly and I almost couldn't get it to unmute, headset is too loose and heavy to do any kind of physical activity or even lean forward without them falling off, extension cord is split between input and output so it can't be used as both input and output through one headphone jack i.e. for my laptop--------------------------------------------------------------------I was really attracted to these because they are cute, and there weren't too many options for pink headphones, and I really wanted to look cute for Twitch streaming and Zoom/Discord calls. Let me start by saying I have beat the crap out of these and they still work, but a lot of the features I liked broke or stopped working well after a few months and then I stopped caring about being gentle with them.Most notably, the mute button/volume dial, it is so poorly constructed, you can feel the plastic moving around. The mute button itself often didn't mute or would get stuck muted, or half muted where it would make a humming or interference noise for people in my voice calls. It finally stopped working entirely after a few months and almost got stuck in the muted position. It was never reliable which lead to some embarrassing situations where I thought I was muted and I was NOT. There are also ridges on the volume adjustment that often get caught on clothing and it turns itself down or all the way up and I have to double check it. Ideally it would have been better if Razer put these buttons on the headset itself instead. It was nice to have volume control separate but it was more annoying than beneficial most of the time. It doesn't really have any amount of noise cancelling or anything, it feels similar to wearing earmuffs for the winter, I can still hear everything it's just a little muffled.The mic on this headset is absolutely awful and I would NOT recommend anyone rely on it for quality voice input. I don't know if it's just built badly or if mine is slowly getting worse over time but I have a lot of complaints about the mic. First off, the mic picks up sound coming from your earphones, I feel like that should be a basic requirement for a headset to not do that.... I have to have the volume very quiet in order to avoid the mic picking up what I am listening to. This is worse while the mic is pushed in to the headset, and only a little better when you pull the mic out to be near your mouth, but it still happens so it kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset. There has been more than one occasion where my music was picked up in a meeting by my mic, so again very embarrassing situations sometimes. There is zero consistency on mic pickup volume, I have used this for Zoom, Discord, BlueJeans, Facebook Video, Twitch, OBS, and regular phone calls, and all of them have wildly differing volumes of pickup. I use Zoom and Discord the most. On Zoom the mic seems to be supersonic and can pick up sounds across the room, when I'm on Discord on the same computer I have my input boosted and have the mic literally touching my mouth and my friends can barely hear me most of the time, it is so frustrating. Annoyingly this changes frequently, a few weeks ago I was too loud on Discord despite not changing any settings and then this week I am too soft despite being boosted all the way up. If I use the extension cord it changes the whole situation again to where I am having to adjust my settings and test my mic constantly. The extension cord itself is nice but I almost never use it as it is split into input and output only, so I can't use these as a headset on things with a singular audio jack like my laptop and phone which is 90% of my usage.Physically the headset feels sturdy, and I have dropped it more times than I care to admit, but overall the headset is heavy because the metal ear cups and headband, making it slip and slide off if I lean down to pick something up. If I shake my head with any amount of force the headset slips right off, so I can't wear it for anything but sitting at my desk, I have to switch to my old Sony bluetooth headphones if I want to work out, which I don't think I was looking for these to be an all in one solution for me, but it's still disappointing to take a phone call and have to constantly adjust these on my head if I do any amount of movement. It's comfortable to wear all day for sure, and I wear glasses so that's an achievement.The sound quality is decent, I can't really complain about that.Overall I would say these weren't worth the purchase. Granted the price point is pretty low for a corded headset but it is a constant headache to adjust the mic settings on every application. I would not purchase these again if I was in the market for a decently priced headset. They are cute and trendy, but really only work well as headphones if you sit still all day.",

          "I'll start off by saying this is in fact my 1st pair of gaming headphones that I've purchased myself other than that, this is my 2nd pair of gaming headphones the 1st being a pair of budget friendly MSI Gaming headphones.Now that I've got that out of the way these are a great pair of headphones whether that be for (gaming, voice chat, or ordinary Music listening. The audio is nice and balanced, you can hear highs which are very pronounced considering the frequency range of these headphones which is as stated 15hz - 28khz the mids are pronounced as well as the low end but don't expect a bunch of bass unless you're using a external amp or DAC, (it really depends on your gear Phone, PC and gear you're using to power this headphones)as far as the 7.1 Surround sound that's advertised, I cannot comment on that feature since I don't use it, the cool gel infused ear cups do actually work and keeps your ears cool without too much sweatOther than that, a great pair of gaming headphones for the price while being budget friendly and great audio quality and perfect for any beginner gamer.Also lastly I want to talk about that Frequency range which is that 15hz - 28Khz we spoke about earlier, you can her that low end but it depends on the type of music you're listening to that focus on bass such as Dubstep/Trap/Rap etc. and if you want to Enjoy these headphones with their 50mm drivers I'd suggest using a good quality AMP/DAC to really push these as well as to use a Type C to Female 3.5mm aux cable which you'll get much better performance out of these pair of cans.I hope anyone reading this I was able to help you in considering your purchase or any confusion you may have had.",

          "=== Update January 23, 2021 ===After months of struggling with Razer's unacceptably bad customer support, I finally got a replacement for my headset. Everything I love about these headphones still stands (comfortable, padded metal headband, good sound), and now, with the replacement, the mute button doesn't generate a loud staticky noise for people on the other end. I feel confident that I can use my headphones for work.Good customer support is key to repeat customers and word of mouth. I normally have excellent experiences with customer support because I'm polite and treat the support people like the human beings they are. I can't explain why Razer's support is so terrible. I find myself wondering if it's designed to make people give up on getting service.Bottom line: read the reviews. Find a company with better customer support.=== Update January 12, 2021  ===TL;DR The headset's mute button has a known flaw that sends a staticky noise to anyone on the other end. Getting my headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.Here's what's been happening: Razer has opened three warranty support cases, telling me I have 30 days to return my headset. In the first two cases, after many emails from me to them about problems with FedEx rejecting the tracking labels, they closed the cases before the 30-day time period had expired. In the most recent case, they closed it after only 11 days.Each time they closed my case, I called Razer again. The tech support persons acknowledged that the cases had been closed too soon, but said there was nothing to do but open a new case, with all the time-consuming emails and proofs of purchase that a new case entails.Latest incident/case: On January 1, 2021, Razer opened a third warranty support case, and then closed it on January 12. In this case, they claimed they emailed me another return label, but that I hadn't used it within the 14 days allotted for the label, so they were closing the case. (Math doesn't seem to be their strong suit.) But although I checked all possible email accounts and folders, including the spam folders, I didn't see the label. I emailed Razer three times asking for them to re-send the label, and they didn't.I'm mind-boggled. I normally have excellent experiences with tech support and customer support, even with companies that are notorious for bad tech/customer support.I called Razer again today to see if I can get this straightened out. At least this time they aren't opening a new case, and they sent me a label, so there's that. Here's hoping I get a replacement without the mute button flaw. If I do, I'll give the headset more stars, but I can't in all good conscience give their customer support anything but zero stars.=== 12/31/2020 update ===So the replacement process for the second case proceeded exactly as the first one did. Many emails back and forth with Razer, me asking for help with my FedEx tracking label, the responses ignoring my requests. (The FedEx website kept telling me the tracking number was invalid. I didn't want to take the package to a drop-off box if the tracking number was invalid.)Once again, the tech support person handling my case closed the case early, claiming it was because 14 days had passed on the RMA. It's true that more than 14 days had passed, but as before, in multiple emails, they said I had 30 days.I called Razer today and spoke with a support person. He said my case should not have been closed (because, obvs, it's not January 3 yet). He cheerfully opened yet another case for me. We'll see how well this goes.By the way, if you're having the same trouble, I finally figured out the FedEx problem--you have to call FedEx and speak with a person. You can't use their automated phone scheduling and you can't use their website. I don't know why Razer didn't tell me this the many times I asked them about it.Although the headset is good quality overall, the mute button problem makes it unacceptable for professional work. The headset has been sitting in a box to be returned to Razer since October, and meanwhile I've been making do with my decrepit backup headset.=== Original review November 2020===I use my headset every day for work, and I've been buying inexpensive Logitechs, which are good but wear out in a year. So this year I treated myself to a more expensive headset.I love the look of this headset, and I love how comfortable the earpieces are. The sound is good and the noise-cancelling is excellent.However, from the very outset, people on the other end of a call complained of an irritating staticky noise every time I used the mute button. I looked it up and found many reviews in which this same problem was mentioned. Of course, this is unacceptable in a professional environment. The last thing you want to do is to generate an irritating noise while discussing important, tricky issues with your boss or co-workers.Bottom line: getting the headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.Here are the details of my interactions with Razer.On October 7, 2020, I started the RMA process with Razer. After almost a month of emails back and forth in which they asked for a lot of testing on my end, they agreed to replace the headset. They issued an RMA and a FedEx shipping label on November 9. They told me the RMA would stay open for 30 days from the day it was opened. Take note of that; it's important.Unfortunately, the email with the label went into my spam folder. Since I was receiving all their other emails, I had no reason to expect it to go to spam. I emailed Razer asking the status and they weren't helpful. It took me over a week to find the label email. I emailed them again saying I'd finally found it, and asking for help on the return, since they included only the instruction that I must return everything that had come in the box.After many email exchanges with no adequate answers from Razer, I contacted FedEx to arrange a pickup. FedEx said the tracking number was invalid. I emailed Razer several times telling them that. Razor kept responding by saying it was either my error or a problem with FedEx. They advised me to contact FedEx for help. I finally emailed them on November 24 asking them point-blank if the tracking number had expired, and if so, could they send a new one. I got this response on November 28.\"Upon further checking your case, your prepaid shipping label with the tracking number, XXXX was created last 11/09/2020 and is still not used until now. However, please be advised that both your RMA XXXX and shipping label are already expired since it's already beyond 14 days from the date it was created. Our RMA is only valid for 14 days from the date it was provided. Please be informed that I will now close the case and RMA. This case is now considered closed. Since the RMA and shipping label are already expired, please contact our Technical Support team for a new case, new RMA and new shipping label to be provided to you. Don't worry, they will be able to assist you to schedule a pickup using a new shipping label.\"At this point I feel like I was getting the run around and experiencing delaying tactics, especially the support person said my RMA had expired, but they had earlier said my RMA would be open for 30 days, and that it was the _label_ that would expire in 14 days. November 28 is NOT 30 days from November 9.I was tempted to give up, and it feels like that's exactly what they want me to do, but instead I persevered and contacted Razer on 12/3 to restart the RMA process.I hope I will get a replacement product that doesn't have the staticky sound when using the mute button. I'll keep you posted.",
          "I usually like the Razer Kraken Ultimate, USB but it was not available in white. (Computer build is all white.) I wish Razer and other companies would give us more white options. Very hard to find.But over all, very good headset, big thumbs up.I gave a 4 star on sound quality, just because of the fact that for some reason USB sounds much better than standard 35mm jack this headset uses.",
          "Cool color nice sound. Use it for music stuff and it makes my Jimmie\u2019s russle",
          "There is just nothing bad to say about this headphones, except that its too good, like actually too good, the noise cancellation is so good that i cant hear myself when i'm speaking, and the sound quality is just exceptional.",
          "Es muy bueno el producto me encanta su calidad",
          "Wanted a wired gaming headset that would fit PS5 and the Switch, while not costing an arm and leg. The Razer Kraken fit the bill. Mic and sound is on par for the price. It's also comfortable for long time wear, perfect for late night gaming and not disturbing the family.",
          "My ears stick out a little, not quite Alfalfa but close, and these are comfortable.  The don't push my ears back which gets rather uncomfortable during a podcast recording session.  Highly recommend if you want a good hand affordable headset.",
          "Classic set of gaming headphones.Pros: By far the most comfortable set I've ever had and I think that is because of the seriously massive earpads, they are very roomy and definitely dont make your ears feel cramped at all. The cooling gel is also far better than 99% of stock earpads on other headphones even 3x the price of these.Cons: Not the best in terms of sound quality. I mostly play FPS games, and these headphones are on the bassier/muddy end of the sound spectrum, so not ideal for picking out footsteps and the like. They sound pretty good when it comes to music and movies, and other games where the finer details arent super important. The wire and microphone are permanently attached, which can be a killer for some people, but the microphone retracts into the earcup so they can be stealthy enough if you're not trying to scream \"GAMER\" while wearing them.",
          "Comfortable, Adorable and work well.",
          "My son is really hard on his headsets. We bought this Razer headset because of the brand and price. I wasn\u2019t sure how well it was going to hold up because he is always dropping it or taking it to school. However, it is held up perfectly. We haven\u2019t had any issues. I will be buying this headset again\u2026if he doesn\u2019t eventually break it",
          "Brought the headset for my son for Christmas and he was very pleased",
          "Can't go wrong with these",
          "Could be better, but okay.",
          "My 17-year-old son bought these to play Apex online.  He said, \"Mom, I got a better headset (read: more expensive) do you want these?\"  I was working with a broken pair of turtle beach headsets I bought in a desperate attempt to keep my job after my Logitech's died.  My Turtle Beach headset bit the dust in a year of daily use.  My Logitech died after two years. These are almost a year old and show almost no wear, so I'm gonna state this pretty confidently...they are better than Turtle Beach.  I'm a 43-year-old that sits at a desk and answers phones for a living...headsets should last a minimum of two years for someone like me.  I think these will last at least that long.",
          "8.5/10",
          "Pretty good sound quality for the price point. My biggest issue with these is sound leaking out of the headphones; if my audio is playing too loud or my mic is slightly upwards or angled differently, my friends in voice chat can hear my audio (super weird). Other than that, they work just fine for my casual everyday use. Matches perfectly with other Razer products in the Quartz color :-)",
          "These have got to be the best ever! Noise cancellation is \ud83d\udcaf . Best sound quality ever!",
          "I highly recommend buying this product if you want a headset with not only good sound qualities but a great mic as well. I've had this product for a little over a year now and it still works like a charm. The mic is very flexible and does not snap off/make weird \"popping noises,\" and you can easily retract the mic back into your headset if you don't need to use it. There's also your own personal headset settings on the upper cord portion of your headset that allows you to increase and decrease the volume or to mute your mic. Razer also gives you more options if you have a gaming PC/Windows computer (sadly not for Mac users), if you wish to have better sound quality for your headset. You simply head over to the website the paper inside the box provides and enter the code on the front side of of the card to unlock those settings for your headset! Again, highly recommend getting one of these (in any color) if you're in need of one thats good quality and very durable.",
          "The sound quality is decent, but I love the color and how it fits.",
          "I just needed a gaming headset asap so I purchased this. I love the sound, it\u2019s very loud. I love that the wire is very long. I play on my gaming laptop so it\u2019s very long and annoying but I am in the process of building a pc so the long wire will be useful when I have a proper set up. I don\u2019t use the mic, not a talker in video games so I can\u2019t say anything about that as I don\u2019t use it. It\u2019s also super cute!"

          "My biggest concerns when buying headphones for gaming was Ear/Head comfort and maneuverability/adjustment of the headphones' ear pieces.I wear glasses all the time, and I've had a pair of JVC headphones before that always squeezed my head too tight and made my ears and temples hurt because the headphones were pressing my glasses too hard against my head. Conversely, I've also had Sony headphones in the past. Sony headphones are great for casually listening to music and watching videos and stuff, and they're very portable and easy to fold up and turn the ear-pieces in all different directions. Sony ones are also very comfortable as a result. The problem with Sony headphones - the coating around the foam of the ear pieces eventually wears off, gets full of earwax, and peels away over time, and the headphones lose their elasticity and become so loose around your head that they don't cancel noise anymore.I was looking for something comfortable and highly adjustable as a person who wears glasses all the time and didn't want cheap ear pieces that would lose their quality over time.After looking at several reviews online for different sets of Gamer headphones, I found the Blackshark V2 X Razer Headphones. These also come with movie theater sound that is very easy to set up on your computer as an additional audio output beside your computer's ordinary stereo speaker audio, as well as stickers for your laptop or the headphones themselves. These headphones may look strange and bulky at first glance, but they actually look very cool when worn, and are amazingly comfortable to wear. I've had these for several months now. The ear pieces have not worn out at all, and they rest around your ear, not against the ear itself, so no earwax will get on them, and nothing will be pressing against your ears. Unlike most headphones that have the volume controls on the cord, these headphones have a volume wheel you can twist/turn on the left ear-piece, as well as a mute button. This is far more convenient for gamers who can quickly reach up to change the volume instead of fumbling with a cord. The headphones look tight but are surprisingly gentle. They don't squeeze very hard because the ear pieces are large enough and soft enough to evenly distribute the pressure around your head so that it doesn't hurt. I've worn them for long hours wearing glasses the entire time, and they've never caused me a shred of discomfort. They're almost plush and soft by design, both the ear cushions and the arched frame of the head piece. The metal wires connecting the ear pieces to the head frame are extendable for height adjustment, but the headphones don't fold up very compactly for travel. Don't try to fit them in a backpack or purse. The microphone head is made of soft foam that can be removed if you desire it, but the microphone itself cannot be detached from the headset. The microphone is very malleable and can be easily bent into any position desired (not just up or down). The cord is bright green and divided into two parts. One half of the cord has a single audio plug connected to the headset. The other half of the cord is an extension that the first half can plug into that allows your computer to hook up to both the microphone and the headset via two audio plugs. This pair of headphones was worth it!",
          "I would highly recommend the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset to anyone looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and reliable gaming headset. The sound quality, microphone performance, and overall design make it an excellent choice for both casual and competitive gamers alike.  It is true, these headphones are pretty awesome!!",

          "Easily among the most durable set of headsets that I've bought. Got it December 31, 2020 and it's lasted me thus far (2023). The cable tip gets looser with age, but it doesn't slide off the adapter. Its features (volume control and mute button) make it perfect for console too, but I primarily use it on my computer.The one big complaint that I have is that it picks up internal audio when I'm in a Discord call. I don't know what exactly causes it, but sometimes when I'm watching YouTube with a decently low volume other people will hear it as if it were a soundboard. This also sometimes happens even when the button mute headset function is engaged.If you're on Push-To-Talk, this really shouldn't be a big problem (but still, it's very annoying for others). Other than that, it's a very durable headset that can be used for both PC and console (tested with PS4 controller).",
          "Sort of wish I just paid the extra 30 bucks and got the more pro version. The cable on this is lame. The rest is great. Not sure how I feel about the emulated 7.1 but it seems to work.",
          "Maybe my old headphones were just that worn out, but I am highly impressed by the sound quality of this set. Outside noise is muffled, but not really canceled.My only real issue is the microphone. I don't use it, so I should have splurged for a model that lets me either retract/remove it because as it stands now it's in the way.Edit: I used the cord tie to hook the mic up out of the way (see pic). So it's not really in the way anymore.",
          "The headphones themselves are okay, however there is a problem when you plug in the mic. There\u2019s no mic audio at all, and the pc\u2019s sound glitches horribly.",
          "By no means am I a person who is well versed with understanding different audio capabilities, high and low frequency sounds, and how this headset compares to the vast and competitive line of other gaming headsets. With that, take this review for what you will.I purchased the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 PS4 Headset and the Razer Blackshark V2 X that's compatible with the PS4. I wanted to pin them against each other as these seemed like two budget friendly options that many Youtuber's talk about. My ultimate choice was to keep the Blackshark V2 X because it is by far the most comfortable headset I have ever worn. It is really lightweight, has a very comfortable headband and ear pieces and has no pressure points. I also wear glasses once in awhile and I can say that the headset was beyond comfortable after hours of play while wearing glasses. It felt like thy weren't even there at all. To say that they are very comfortable is a complete understatement, just try them yourself.The sound quality to me was great as well and while playing games, it felt like a thoroughly immersive experience. Not to mention the noise cancellation worked as advertised and it did make it difficult to hear anything around me while playing. With the exceptional bass the headset packs and the ability to hear the world around you, I really felt like I was in the game I was playing. For example, while shooting guns in games, the bass and the controller vibration make it feel like I'm really there in game. I was really blown away by that feeling. Very immersive and the sound quality was clear, consistent, and is something that I truly look forward to when I play now. While the build is a little different than what I'm used to, I really do think the pilot headset look is dope. No issues with the mic either.I mentioned earlier that I chose these against the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 and some may want to know why I did. I found the TB's to be bulkier and heavier than what I already had and were also not nearly as comfortable. In my humble opinion, it doesn't matter how great a headset sounds, if the headset is uncomfortable, they're coming off. They had a lot of pressure points and with my glasses, they did tend to bother my ears (even though I have small sized ears). I also wear earrings and the design of the ear pads on the TB's irritated my ears and made them hot and a bit sore tbh. They sound great, pack plenty of bass and boy do they get loud, but to me, it wasn't worth the extra 50 bucks you'd spend if you did choose the TB's over the Blacksharks. I also tried to do a little test of the directional sound compared to the blacksharks and I didn't come across any difference in the quality of the directional audio and ability to hear other players nearby or in the direction shots were fired, etc.Honestly, you won't be disappointed going with the Blackshark VS X. A quality product at a price you truly can't beat! See for yourself why so many people like this headset!",
          "I recently purchased the Razer BlackShark V2 X gaming headset and I'm extremely happy with my purchase. The headset is very comfortable to wear and has great sound quality. The microphone is also very clear and picks up my voice well. I also appreciate the sleek design and the fact that it's compatible with multiple gaming platforms. Overall, I highly recommend the Razer BlackShark V2 X gaming headset for anyone looking for a high-quality gaming headset.",
          "Everything about the unboxing and us feels great, the headset is of high quality for sure. The tuning of the headset out of the box misses the mark with excessive bass especially at around 140 - 160hz which makes them sound to muffled. In the photo i attached I'm showing my EQ curve to get the mid and high frequencies balanced while reducing the some of low and mid bass.  at 150hz i set it to -5db where my entire mid section from 1k to 4k hover between 6 - 10db boost (That's 10 to 15db of adjustment to balance the mid and high frequencies for both games and music.  I admit my ears are bit older and you may find your adjustments less aggressive but at least you know what you're getting.The headset is comfortable and cancel a good amount of noise from your surrounding.  I normally prefer to hear my surrounding bleeding through the headset but there are just right.  Headphones come with Splitter for PC with dark cable and green connectors which in all a very nice presentation. Barely any plastic in the box which is nice to see.I'm not sure I will keep them, the EQ curve to make them shine is a bit aggressive for my taste.  It's possible that I got used to the Roccat headsets I previously owned being nicely tuned out of the box with very little adjustments needed.",
          "I got these for a 12 year old gamer boy. He's torn through a few other pairs, so I don't expect these to last more than a year, but they do seem durable enough to last.For a youth with a not full grown head, these are comfortable and go \"over ear\" which he prefers because \"on ear\" (Like Beats by Dre) hurt his ears.I can tell from talking with him in game that the microphone is very good compared to his earlier headsets.So far so good.",
          "These earphones seriously cancel out things you can hear, including your own voice. If you are a podcaster, honestly this mike is superior to a Blue Yeti. I love my Yeti, but for a LOT of use, this headset is better.",

          "These headphones are good for gamers who want to graduate from something cheaper.Recommend.",
          "I wish I loved these things. They\u2019re nearly perfect aside from the biggest selling point, sound quality. More on this later.I love the aviator-like build and the functionality of going wired makes them super lightweight. The ear cups are spacious and the foam is thick and soft, much more so than my $230 Astro A30\u2019s. If you find your ears cramped in smaller models, HyperX Cloud stinger core, Astro A10-30, these will be a comfortable option. Ease of use gets 5 stars for plug and play usability and from what I\u2019ve seen, universal compatibility between systems.For $50 these are incredibly comfortable and will accomplish everything you wish from a modestly priced, well built wired headset.Immersion is where these fall short. 3D surround is adequate for good peripherals but the bass and lows are nonexistent. I\u2019m by no means an audiophile, but these just lacked the feedback I desire from a headset. I must also say I\u2019m a bit biased as I picked up a pair of A30\u2019s for half price today and the bass and immersion is next level, to be expected for over 4x the price. If you don\u2019t need immersion and just want a super comfortable headset with great compatibility these most likely won\u2019t disappoint!",
          "Big 50mm drivers, accurate sound, excellent soundstage and superior microphone quality. I can't really recommend these enough.Specifically designed and targeted as an ESports headset, it's decent for music and all other audio tasks.However, if you're hunting for positional audio over any thing else, these are the ones to try.Yes, they're wired and that's a bummer, but the wireless version of this set sadly lacks these amazing earcups and therefore has a poor soundstage and passes through a bunch of ambient sounds.Lastly, the mic is fantastic. I actually use this instead of my XLR Condenser setup because the performance is negligible (unless you drop serious cash on a pro streamer setup). I'm not overstating the greatness here.All of these features put together make this an insane deal for a sub-$50 headset. You will not be disappointed, I literally bought one as a backup so if/when they stop producing this I'll have an extra. Yeah, I know...",

          "I bought the first pair as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. He loved them so I decided to buy a second pair for my sister in pink. First of all the pink is gorgeous! I am planning on buying a third pair, pink as well, for myself. They are super comfortable on the ears. The sound quality is perfect! The microphone is awesome! Picks up everything. I mean everything. So ladies if your man is playing and you start talking in the background be sure it\u2019s not about something you don\u2019t want his friend group knowing. The headset comes with cord extenders which was awesome. We haven\u2019t had to use them but it\u2019s nice to have them. We also got a nice velvet travel bag for the headsets. Haven\u2019t had a chance to use it but it\u2019s nice to have it for whenever we do choose to travel. I was happy with the first purchase but I\u2019m over the moon with the second purchase! I can honestly recommend these headsets to anyone wanting a good pair of gaming headset for their loved ones! They are certified noise canceling, trust me I tried it. I have to scream at the top of lungs to get his attention. They are one of the best headset I\u2019ve tried so far and they are priced fair. You gets a good quality headset for a fair price.",
          "Tan buenos, tienen una cancelaci\u00f3n de  ruido muy buena y la Calidad de los materiales y sonidos estan muy buenos.",
          "Good headset, the price fluctuates, its a $60 headset i got mine for $40 but I would easily pay $60, pretty solid build.  The metal bars holding it looked a little sketchy but its pretty sturdy this wouldn't break like nothing, plus it can extend a pretty good amount to fit your ears. I love the mute button it feels natural to press its in a convenient spot. Same with the volume knob on the side, the volume knob also has slight resistance at the 50% volume mark and almost \"locks it into place\" as you go over it making it easy to tell which volume you're at. Good sound quality i can hear things clearly, I have good directional sound, lows, mids and highs are all fine and clear, very good balanced sound. Its lightweight and comfortable to wear long term it basically disappears on your head. And it does a pretty good job at canceling out sound. The box came a little ripped on the top and one of the corners was slightly indented but that's no big deal at all, everything inside the box was well secured and in perfect shape. This may be an irrelevant detail but it also comes with strong rubber things to hold neatly store the cord when not in use, you can take it off or keep it on your cord. The cord for the headset itself also seems very strong. The mic is pretty good, I haven't heard the sound quality but my friends say it sounds better then my previous, it does a very good job getting rid of background noise and I can keep it a good distance away from my face and still be able to be heard clearly.",
          "For what it costs, I had relatively low expectations of this headset.  I came from a Corsair Virtuoso SE wireless headset that had a great mic and very good sound, but the connection with my PS4 was never very solid and I would notice relatively frequent dropouts in audio.  Friends with PS4s swore by using the 3.5mm jack on the controller and I decided to use this to test.Build QualityWhen you pick up the headset the first thing you notice is just how light it is.  It feels somewhat solid, but also it's clear that this is not a headset that prioritized premium materials.  It's also extremely comfortable because of how light it is.  Although I've never had issues with heavier headsets and neck pain, if that is a consideration the light materials should be great for long term sessions.The pads are faux leather on the interior ring and exterior ring.  The part that rests against your head feels like something a little more breathable.  I don't think I will have any issues wearing these for long sessions.  The clamping force is a good moderate level where they won't fall off accidentally, but I don't feel like I am in a death grip.Mic QualityI made some calls using the mic and, I believe this to be a great compliment to the quality of the mic, no one thought I was on a headset.  \"It's like you were actually talking through your phone.\"  Although they have a gamer vibe, I could definitely see using these on conference calls (as long as the video was off.)  Basically, the mic is great.Audio QualityHere's where I was expecting things to fall apart, but they really didn't.  I decided to make a completely unfair comparison between these and my pair of Sennheiser HD600s run off of an AudioQuest DragonFly Black DAC/AMP.  There was clearly no contest between the two headphones in terms of vocals or detail retrieval, but the Razer wasn't a bad headphone by any means.  It had a clear and present bass, without being muddy.  I do feel like the Corsair Virtuoso had a more full sound, but the spotty connection ruined it.Gaming tends to be, I think, more forgiving than listening to music ... so I ran through a couple of games as a test.  I tried a game that I feel focuses on background music (Unravel), which sounded great.  I also tried something with more exploding (Borderlands 3) and the headset felt equally competent.Flaws (But Not Deal Breakers)The volume knob goes the opposite of the way my mind treats every other volume knob in my life.  Clockwise turns the sound down?!  WHY?!I would have loved an LED to remind me that I'm muted.  My first attempted call failed because the mute was engaged.ConclusionThe Razer Blackshark V2 X might have a terrible name, but it's an amazing product at the price point.  I don't play as many games online as I used to and I listen to a lot more music.  For me, it makes sense to have a great pair of headphones for music and solo play as well as a cheap headset for online play with friends and conference calls.  This works for me.",
          "I had been using a Razer Nari Wireless headset whos left speaker has been starting to go and the battery dying have been thwarting my all-day use of it.  I got these wired BlackSharks Like-New for a great price and they sound better than the Naris!  The included 7.1 surround sound app is a MUST.  The bass sounds great, mids clear, and the highs are good.  The cable is shorter (3 feet?) which is perfect for my usage case, I unplug/replug the 3.5mm connector into my Desktop/Laptop/Xbox controller so I can use it for everything.  It came with a 3.5mm splitter/extender to split the ports into Mic/Speaker for old school PC connectors.Amazon did a great job making the package feel like New, everything was wrapped nicely and if you told me it was New id believe you.",
          "I play a lot of Call of Duty and this headset is perfect for it. You can hear footsteps way better and the sound quality is better than any headset I\u2019ve had. Also the clarity of the microphone is great. I cannot believe how good this headset is for the price. I recently bought a headset here on Amazon that had 100K+ reviews at 4.5 stars, it was $70. I was very disappointed with that headset and I had to return it. After that I bought this headset, it was on deal. Only cost me $45 and this headset is 100 times better than the one I paid $70 for. I\u2019ve been using it for a week so far I love it. This headset is definitely built for competitive gaming and I think it will last me a long time",
          "Me agrad\u00f3 mucho la comodidad que tienen y su sonido es excepcional.",
          "The build quality is pretty great for being so affordable; the headrest and the earcups are fake leather, but the earcups have an extra layer of fabric where you face would be so it's not uncomfortable. That being said, the fabric is similar to a cheap car seat cover so if you constantly are removing one side, it can be uncomfortable for that fabric to be continuously rubbing against your face. The microphone is a good upgrade if you have any headset under $30, and it's got a pop filter too, the only gripe I have with it is it isn't detachable and the microphone wire loosens over time and becomes less rigid, though still useable. It's got an onboard microphone mute and volume dial that will click when set to higher volumes so you don't deafen yourself accidentally. The audio quality is pretty great as well, it's no hi-fi, but I always found myself being able to accurately locate enemies in Apex while my friends scrambled around. It's a great headset for casual players and lower rank competitive players, if you're more hardcore you might want something better, but for I'd say 80% of players this will be amazing. If you're considering buying a cheap no-name headset, I highly encourage you to spend the extra 10-20 Dollars more to get this one.",
          "I bought this as a gift for one of my brothers so that he could play games with me and the quality sounds great. No echoes and no screeching.",
          "El producto lleg\u00f3 en buenas condiciones, es un producto muy bueno por el precio en el que se oferta, lo \u00fanico malo que le veo es que pueden llegar hacer un poco calurosos, esto tambi\u00e9n depende de c\u00f3mo sea el clima en tu residencia",
          "It was quite difficult to setup.",
          "As a gamer, these headphones are alright. Pretty loud for gaming.As a daily music listener, meh....When I'm listening to spotify on my PC the music is less audible, muffled and much more bass to it. Sounds like my music was released in the 1900s. I have to put the volume way up to hear the singers voices and instrumentals better, pretty bothersome for me.Don't recommend for casual music listeners, would recommend for gamers but there are better options tbh.Guess I'll have to keep these until they die off for my next change of headphones. HyperX Stinger had better audio than this. For a budget headset its OKAY, but I'll have to return to Stinger if I can't find another option.Havent tested noise cancellation as I have my own standing mic.Color was nice I guess!",
          "Was hoping for a headset that wouldn't hurt my ears (they're sensitive) but no dice. They squeeze too tight. It hurts and I stop enjoying the game because of itI'm not the normal customer though so if you don't have this problem with other headphones you've tried then you should be good",
          "Estaba preocupado por comprar un splitter porque en la publicaci\u00f3n no lo dice, pero viene incluido. Adem\u00e1s viene pueden descargar un software para escuchar mejor en los juegos.",
          "I would give this product 4.75 stars if I could the only issues is that the ear cups are tight however I am hopeful that this will loosen up with time I love the volume control knob as it gives me more precise control as opposed to a recessed dial like many other products they are very lightweight and can hardly be felt while wearing",
          "Ped\u00ed en color rosa ya que era el que ten\u00eda fecha de entrega m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida, me hubiese gustado en menta o blanco... pero el rosa no est\u00e1 mal, es un rosa suave agradable a la vista. Los audifonos est\u00e1n extremadamente c\u00f3modos, suavitos, yo tengo piercings en las orejas y regularmente me duelen cuando estoy mucho tiempo con audifonos de este estilo, pero con este modelo puedo durar el dia entero y no me lastiman ni nada, adem\u00e1s reducen mucho el ruido.. los am\u00e9.!!Generalmente compro headsets con conexi\u00f3n USB porque alguna vez tuve mala experiencia con los que son 3.5mm, adem\u00e1s mi laptop tiene entradas separadas para audio y micr\u00f3fono, en las especificaciones no dice y en ning\u00fan comentario encontr\u00e9, ten\u00eda miedo de que me viniera con un solo conector 3.5mm para audio y sonido, en tal caso me hubiese tocado comprar un adaptador que los separe, pero traen ambas opciones, adjunto la foto, tiene un solo conector 3.5mm y a la vez tiene los 2, uno pra el micr\u00f3fono y otro para el audio.Razer ofrece una tecnolog\u00eda para una mejor experiencia con sus audifonos, dentro de la caja viene una tarjeta con un QR, leyendolo lleva a una p\u00e1gina para descargar el aplicativo correspondiente al modelo comprado, si ya tienes una cuenta en razer, debes registrar tu compra para que te llegue un codigo de activacion al correo y ese se debe poner en la aplicacion para poder disfrutar de la misma.",
          "everything on these headphones are 10/10 the microphone sounds like a standalone usb mic and the headphones deliver extreme bass and could be very loud if you like it like that, amazing headphone would definitely recommend",
          "This headset was purchased to replace a Hyper X Cloud Alpha S in which the mic stopped working after ~2 years.  In comparison to the aforementioned product, the Razer offering is less than half the cost while sounding better (both mic and headphones).  Comfort is a touch below the Cloud's, but not by much.  Fit is firm & secure.  Feels well made. The controls are simple and well implemented.Sound signature - bass is excessive but very clean, vocals are a touch recessed, highs have excellent resolution without being fatiguing.  Female vocals are really the only weak point, and they aren't terrible just lacking a bit of warmth.For ~$40, it is an exceptional value; probably better than most of the competition regardless of price.",
          "It would be very hard to come up with a better gaming headset than this at this price point.",
          "La verdad es que por el precio me parece un producto de excelente calidad en l\u00edneas generales, lo he usado por varias horas jugando y la verdad es que son muy c\u00f3modos, quiz\u00e1s la \u00fanica pega que le encuentro es que para escuchar musica instrumental deja mucho que desear, en cambio si eres fan del hip-hop ser\u00eda una compra redonda.",
          "2.)COMFORT AND BUILD QUALITY: They are very lightweight and super easy to wear for longgg periods of time. The overall quality and feel of the headset is sturdy thick plastic, not cheap creeking plastic, with metal or aluminum adjustment sliders. The ear cushions and very soft leathery material and stays nice and firm, with the material quality being superb, so after months of use you won\u2019t have flat, hard earpads. The actual size of the ear cups and awesome not to small to here the crush the tops of your ears they go completely around them for nice comfortable seal on the sides of your head with plenty of room for your ears.  This the kind of headset that you will forget you have on. They got the perfect clamping force to stay put and not feel like it\u2019s crushing you, the memory foam keeps them comfortable and in place. The headband is nice and cushioned with leathery material. When it comes to adjusting it on your head it has a dirtent type of adjustment functionality. You can get precise adjustment perfect for you head. It\u2019s not one singular piece to move it slides and 2 diffrent parts on left and right side to get the PERFECT position you like, with ear cups being able to swivel to help even more to seal around your ears and countour of your head.",
          "I'm not an enormous fan of these headphones.To get my largest gripe out of the way, these do not sound good. I would highly recommend a pair of \"music\" headphones, like Takstar Pro 82s, and an external microphone instead of a gaming headset if at all possible. If you can't or don't want to have to afford that admittedly large purchase, these do the job. You will be able to hear your game, and others will be able to hear your voice. I'm sure these would be more than fine for 95% of people, but there are certainly better things out there and I would struggle to recommend these at their normal $50 MSRP. Imaging, or positional audio, is acceptable, and there is a whole load of bass, but if you care about sound quality - you're a PC user looking for a pair of new all-purpose headphones, for example - I would recommend you look elsewhere, and maybe spend a little more on your audio setup.So why the four stars if these suck?I bought two of these on sale as a gift for kids who don't care about their gear. It's a miracle they haven't been stepped on and broken in half by now, but the headsets are both still kicking. That alone is probably commendable, and for a ~$25 sale price (which does seem to be fairly common) these aren't bad at all. They're light on the head, and, overall, comfortable, with large, fabric earpads. The subtle Razer branding and black cups do look nicer than most gaming headsets, and the microphone is certainly serviceable. I have had far worse as a kid on Xbox Live.In short, if you're looking for a pair of headphones to service your daily COD match or two or give to a kid, these are a decent buy. If you or the intended user will rely on these for extended periods - for Teams calls, for music-listening, for movie-watching - I highly recommend doing some research into the plethora of \"audiophile\" options available and getting something better. You'll thank yourself later.",
          "The noise cancelling works great! Only thing I don't like is that you have to turn the knob at least 1/4 turn just to get some sound out of them so they don't really get too loud, but with the noise cancelling it does the job.",
          "Overall headphones are great, though I do have to say when I play with others it can be a little difficult for them to hear me. Other then a lower voice through voice chat they are pretty good and got here fast :)",
          "Great price for a set of headphones I can use when I play Fortnite with my friends without breaking the bank. And for the price, they work pretty decent. Sound canceling, no issues with sound quality. I'm happy with it and even bought one for my dad at Christmas for him to use on the few online games he plays.",
          "El sonido para escuchar es muy bueno y el del micr\u00f3fono es pasable, al principio sonaba re feo pero mi t\u00e9cnico configuro mi pc y ya el audio mejoro bastante de como venia",
          "So far the headset is amazing. No echo like the corsair hs50\u2019s i have. The audio is really clear and crisp. I\u2019m just upset that i paid for the product with one day shipping and my package got manhandled basically. How does this happen to a box that is wrapped is my question? And then i send in the video on my cameras that he just dropped the package. Not knowing whats inside. Like yes the headphones are that expensive and i could get in contact with the amazon support team. But like what if it was an ipad or something more expensive that wasn\u2019t in stock? I don\u2019t know. I just would like for my stuff not to be received as damaged or being dropped at the door like it\u2019s nothing. Other than that, amazing headphones.",
          "Packaging:The headset comes in a beautiful box. The box is very sturdy and provides sufficient cushioning for the headset.The box also comes with a carrying case that feels premium and nice.The item:The headset is designed beautifully and is made with great quality material and comes with both, single and double AUX jacks to ensure the headset and mic are compatible with all systems. For example, my PC tower requires the mic port to be separate from the audio port, while other towers will only require one input jack for both, mic and audio. Either way, both types of connections are provided with this headsetUses:I have been using this mostly for gaming while chatting with the squad. The physical mute button and the physical volume knob are very convenient and my teammates can hear me well.The item comes with free software that enables a 7.1 audio surrounding, which can be very helpful in multiplayer games because the application will help you locate enemies around you based on their footsteps with precision. However, the application may be a little annoying when trying to switch back from headset to regular speakers. That is because your windows system will recognize the new software as the input device, and the app will then let you choose which device you want to play audio through. This is needed to process the 7.1 surrounding audio. So, if you need to switch from the headset back to the speakers, it will also have to be done through the application. You can still choose the audio device directly from your Windows settings, but it will not be 7.1 if not done through the app.Overall, I am really glad I purchased this headset for gaming. I did not need a wireless headset because this was going to be strictly for gaming and it doesn't have to be wireless because I am not moving around. The quality is amazing, designed beautifully, and very convenient.Perfect 5/5",
          "Amazing sound quality that bring next level immersion if you\u2019re used to TV speakers. If I wear them for too long they hurt my head.",
          "\u00a0Sorry for long review but it\u2019s detailed and honest and will absolutely help with your decision.This headset is designed for GAMING and they do just that and more, I GURANTEE you will be beyond happy with this product. ((Id like to say I\u2019ve owned and used these almost everyday for 5 and half months)) If you\u2019ve never owned a Razer product I promise they won\u2019t disappoint you, you should see what your missing out on. Plus 2 year warranty and awesome customer support. I LOVE this headset and I\u2019ve owned turtle beaches, Astro a-10\u2019s, and I\u2019ve tried arctic steelseries 5. Blackshark V2x is simply a better product and you should buy them.1.) SOUND QUALITY: The 50mm triforce drivers should make this headset more and $50-60. With frequency range of 12hz - 28hz you get the most dynamic sound range which is crisp, clean, and defined, plus the triforce technology that no other headset has..Most headsets in the price range are usually 40mm drivers and 20hz-20hz with neodymium magnets which is basic and nothing new. The bass hits HARD and crisp with mids and treble being very clear and loud.  not a muddy/staticky  sound of all three combined. They\u2019ve got a super wide range of volume,you can just keep turning and turning the volume nob until they are so loud but still crystal clear audio.\u00a0",
          "3.) NOISE CANCELLATION: Razer did a very good job with noise cancellation because of the memory foam ear cups that get a good seal on side of your head as I said above. My mom hates it because she can\u2019t yell at me from living room when I have them on. They make for awesome immersive experience, only being able to hear the sweet sounds of gaming,with no background outside noise. The memory foam ear pads really help keep outside noise out. I\u2019m assuming if they were some fabric material sound would seep through.",
          "4.)MICROPHONE QUALITY: I\u2019ve gotten multiple compliments about the clarity of the mic, always asking what mic I have and their surprised by the answer. It\u2019s pretty damn impressive for this headset in this price range, the mic is just as good as some \u201cstreamer mics\u201d. I Never have problems with echoes or like static background noise. It\u2019s literally dead quiet until you speak and it only picks up your voice. We all know if you have a ceiling fan on it can be heard when you talk. This mic doesn\u2019t pick up that sound literally just your voice and you don\u2019t need to have the mic super close to your mouth, can have it decently away and you\u2019ll still sound loud and clear on the other end. Like I said it\u2019s pretty damn impressive for the price of this headset.",
          "I got this in a pinch when I was at home and wanted a headset for traveling but the one I brought had a broken microphone.I got this one for around $30 and I love it. At the moment, I purely use it for my PS5 since it plugs directly into the controller.The headset has great mic quality, sounds great, and is very comfortable to wear. It had adequate clamping force without being too much and the material is soft. It comes with a splitter if you need that.The cable is plenty long for a PS5 controller but might be a bit short depending on where your pc is.",
          "Only problem I've had is that the mic has to be close to mouth to be heard or at least that what my friend has confirmed on discord.",
          "bought these back in 2021 and they are good but you get what you pay for like the mic for example its decent but i had to not only have it on 100% loudness in windows but boost it by 10db just for people to hear me also the cable is not only short but even after 2 years still wants to stay bent the way it was when i first got it lastly the volume slider on the headset broke instead of muting the sound when all the way down it will be down but still auditable but for $50 its still does well enough for me even after 2 years.",
          "Here's the real breakdown. I watched all the product review videos on YouTube and I wanted a pair of affordable headphones with decent sound quality and mic quality. Overall, good sound, good surround, comfortable. Mic needs work.Fit: Oval memory foam ear pads are super comfortable and there is plenty of room so my ears aren't pressed down or uncomfortable. I also wear glasses and that has been pretty comfortable and the glasses aren't digging into my head.Sound Quality: You're not going to get professional-grade audio quality given the price point, but they do come with free Razor 7.1 surround sound software and it works pretty well for gaming. Footsteps are clear and easy to distinguish.Mic: This is the issue with the headset. It is not removable so it is a bit of an eyesore but I was planning on only using this headset to game anyways. But out of the box, the mic is atrocious. Absolutely terrible, Discord and in-game voice chat cannot pick anything up. What you need to do is go to your mic settings and turn your Microphone Boost up to around +20 dB in order for it to sound better. Also, many people report that the issue is the provided audio jack splitter, so if your mic problems persists, purchasing a better one may solve your issue. The mic arm flexibility is okay, but it doesn't tend to stay in the same place after positioning it and may drift back to its original position. I've also read reviews that say it weakens over time and won't be able to hold its position anymore.",
          "I've been using this pair of headphones for 1.5 years now, and they've served me well. As someone with big ears, I struggled to find something comfortable after my Logitech G430s broke (the 3rd pair, don't get those). After trying many, I had to give up on finding high-value headphones where my ears wouldn't make contact with the drivers. Since these are so well made and soft around the ears, I wasn't bothered by the contact and it was easy to get comfortable. The band that sits on the head is also quite soft. The sound quality is good, the mic is fine, and these are all around great.For those concerned about the thin attachments that hold the headphones together, they haven't broken on me and seemingly aren't flimsy at all.My only issue with these (and it is minor) is that at a certain point along the volume dial, the volume might become much lower for one side following some static during the adjustment. This hasn't caused any real issues because anything higher and lower is fine and volume can be further adjusted on the computer to compensate so that your desired volume can be reached regardless. Still definitely recommend it, and this issue hasn't been brought up by any reviewers so it's likely just my pair."

          "The headphones sound great, however, I'm by no means an audiophile. I got them on sale for about 75$ and would absolutely recommend them at that price!Pros:-Great sound! Competes with and honestly sounds better than the Arctis 7 (2019) headset-SUPER COMFORTABLE! These are so light there would be times I'd forget I was wearing them and try to walk off from my computer-My ears don't get very hot wearing these for long periods of gaming-Wearing these with glasses is still super comfortable, even for long periods of time-Again, the comfort on these is great! My Arctis 7 will cause a slight discomfort on top of my head and these felt great the whole timeCons:-The amount of software that gets thrown at you during the initial install is pretty crazy. A lot of it is useless unless you want to control multiple Razer products, but I don't have any besides the headset-Mic quality is pretty poor. It keeps cutting in and out if I talk too fast and sounds muffled-The headset keeps trying to switch between different playback devices (Speakers and THX Spatial Audio Speakers) which means I have to manually change it back to the proper one for sound to work-The EQ that came with the Razer Synapse program doesn't seem to do much. Also, enabling THX Spatial Audio causes the headset to sound like garbage. Apparently this is a known issue to Razer but it just hasn't been fixed from what I readOverall if you're willing to deal with a short USB cable and some potential issues getting the headset to work properly it's worth the money. Just invest into an external mic because this one isn't great.",
          "lo que esperaba",
          "Was really surprised how comfortable these are if people are wondering yes you can use them for PC and yes you can use them for Xbox. I personally use them on my Xbox series X and PC back to back all the time. Worth the purchases thank me later\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb PS these are not noise canceling",
          "This headset is pretty good for gaming and I love how it comes with a USB soundcard for pc. It sounds good and has decent noise cancelation. But if not used to slight noise cancelation. Hearing yourself talk is like sticking your head in a pillow. But overall my only huge complaint is the wire gets tangled pretty easily and adjusting the size of the headset can be a little annoying at times because of the 2 sliders on each side. But overall. Would recommend.",
          "Sounds great, comfortable, so far I really like the headset.",
          "They perform well in what they do and they perform well. The only thing I don't like about them is that the software that you can download requires a activation key. These don't come with the activation key.",
          "Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He's loving it so far.",
          "I'm a big fan of Razer gaming products. I use the Razer Death Adder V2 mouse and love it. So when I needed a good gaming headset with a high quality microphone (for recording gaming videos), the Razer Blackshark V2 + USB Sound Card looked good and it was in a reasonable price range. So, I ordered it from Amazon (about 4 or so months ago). I have use it for 4 months now and here are my thoughts about it:1. The headset itself is very comfortable, it fits snug on my head and the microphone is detachable; so, if you want to remove it and use just the headset, you can.2. The headset comes with Razer Synapse, that you download from their website. Synapse has various settings for the headset, including an equalizer and THX Spatial Surround Sound if you choose to use that. For the headset (hearing) this feature is great.3. The microphone is my biggest complaint. Simply put, it sucks! My voice sounds like I'm in a tin can inside a large tunnel and the white noise is ridiculously loud. I spent days troubleshooting this issue and never found a good solution. For me, this is the biggest pitfall about this headset.It is important that the microphone be high quality, since I record and post gaming videos of my gameplay and commentary/voice as I play. This head fails to do that for me. If I were using this as merely a headset and did not need to mic for recording, only using it to talk to other gamers via Discord, it would be fine. But, as I've mentioned, I record myself as I'm gaming.Because the microphone is so critical for me, personally I give this headset 3 stars. However, since I have a specific need that many other gamers may not have, I've bumped the review rating to 4 stars. As far as using this headset only for gaming and talking on Discord, it's great, I recommend it. If you want to record your voice and your game while you play - this is NOT the headset for you.",
          "They're nice. They feel light on the head and cover my (smaller) ears comfortably. They have a good feel and when paired with the software on PC, they sound great! The ear cups insulate really well and there's very little bleed out into the room. I happen to really like the volume knob on the side of the headset - no searching for buttons or hitting the wrong one on accident.However... and this may just be a \"me\" problem, but when they're plugged into my phone or tablet with the 3.5mm connection they're not the loudest. They're pretty quiet for this price range. In fact, I just checked them on PC and phone playing the same Youtube video on both. The PC topped them out at 90 dB, while the phone was just 60 dB. To verify just how much effect the phone was having, I tried the headset these are replacing and the other set I have. Those were 70 and 75 dB on the phone and high 80's on PC. This tells me the software is giving these a significant boost - which is fine if all you will ever use them for is gaming. Unfortunately for me, these are also meant to replace the headphones I wear at night watching movies - which is over a 3.5mm jack.To be fair, these are marketed as gaming headphones - though I'm not sure how they sound on a console - my kids only left me the PS3.I'm giving 4 stars for the comfort and the great sound on PC. If they weren't as good as they are there, they'd go back. They just don't sound quite good enough or get quite loud enough (for me) to use as an everyday headset for my phone.For those who are unfamiliar with what a 10 dB difference sounds like, 60 is a loud electric toothbrush and 70 is freeway traffic. Also, listening to prolonged sounds above 70 dB is bad for your ears, kids!",
          "No regrets buying this product! The spatial audio is great. I can hear footsteps and bullet shots accurately around me or far away. They're loud and bassy so you definitely know where things are with these. I also use them for my Playstation VR2 and same thing, just REALLY helps you submerge yourself into the game your passing time with. Definitely  recommend them to anyone really. Top notch for the price! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "I've had these for about 12 hrs now and there is definitely some big issues.. now  I must say the sound quality is great on pc like really GOOD....but on ps5 there is definitely a big issue the main issue is the loudness/volume is insanely low on max volume on the ps5 like 1/4 of the volume on pc and the only work around for that is getting a separate amp for your ps5 which is kind of a bummer man but to be far I do believe this is a playstation issue mainly and not a razer issue 2nd when putting the mic in the headphones it legit felt like something was going to break I honestly thought something did which made me look at the connector under a micro lens to make sure and it's like this every time you put the mic back in which has me scared that eventually it will break at some point 3rd when chatting on discord or playstation I get a loud sort of crackling on the other end when someone is talking legit almost always which again a big bummer man also another BIG issue ive notice is when i connect them sometimes to my pc or ps5 only one ear cup is working so I unplug the audio card dongle you plug the headphones into and re seat it and it fixes it definitely not a good sign...but for pros these headphones are legitimately insanely comfortable easily sink hrs in wearing these with out any fatigue or soreness (already tested 6hrs today) also sound quality on this is way above the price of these but would I recommend these.......... probably not mainly due to the mic issue from crackling in voice chat and the one ear cup only working issue  also sounding like the mic is  going to snap in half when you connect it to the headphones now maybe after more use it will get better with wear but I doubt it if it does I'll definitely update this review",
          "I bought  this for a friend  since  I have one to love these headphones. I had mine  for 2 years  and still  going  Strong I have no issue",
          "This is the king of headsets. Do not be fooled by the 100$ price point of this headset.As a competitive gamer, I need every edge I can get over my opponent. This headset does not disappoint. I have tried multiple headsets over $200 and they could not compete in the same league as this headset. I will list all the things I love most down below in order of importance:1.) sound quality - best bang for the buck here. Punchy bass, extremely accurate directional audio (this is the first headset used where I have been able to kill enemies with my eyes closed). This headset gets very loud, no need to worry about missing any enemy footfalls. For music, this headset sounds better than my beats. You can hear every layer of sound and will be fully immersed in music2.) Mic clarity - I have never been more impressed by a headset\u2019s mic. I come in crystal clear over any and all chats. Clear enough to stream with or record YouTube videos, I don\u2019t know how they did it but Razr killed it with this mic.3.) Price - This should be factor number one as far as I\u2019m concerned. I still cannot get over the fact I paid $100 for this engineering marvel. I have tried multiple headsets over the $200 price point and this one is the king. Everything you could ever want in a headset and more.4.) Comfort - this is by far the most comfortable headset I\u2019ve ever worn, it weighs almost nothing and sits like a cloud on my head. I can wear this for eight hours or more comfortably with glasses. This is officially the first time I\u2019ve ever been able to say this about any headset. Flawless design here.After going through multiple more expensive headsets, I finally settled on the Razr Blackshark V2.Other products I tried:Steelseries Arctic 9x - DO NOT BUY THIS ATROCITYHyperX Cloud Revolver S - Fell apart within a yearBoth of these $200+ headsets have far inferior audio quality.I have used expensive Astros and Tritons as well. They can produce similar audio quality, albeit being twice the price and twice as heavy and thus uncomfortable.As an IT guy who handles calls, I use this headset for work as well and couldn\u2019t be happier. Hardcore gamer, audiophile, or phone support - stop shopping around, this is the headset for you.",
          "Really great pair of headphones. I\u2019ve only ever used turtle beaches and a cheap $25 Chinese pair from Amazon, my latest pair of turtle beaches was unreliable with sound and would cut out often when I was playing certain Games, and having the charge the headphones even though they were wired was absurd. After about a year they snapped after being dropped, even thought I took great care of them and never abused them. So I decided I had had enough and wanted to switch to a different company or a more reliable set of headphones without breaking the bank. I\u2019ve had these for about a month and I love them. Phenomenal productPros:Don\u2019t need to charge.Wire is fabric coated and is bendable and doesn\u2019t kink or twist the way rubber ones do. I have no fear of it breaking.Reliable, good sounds. Lots of depth in high and low ranges, and I can hear foot steps intuitively, really helping me up my game.Phenomenal noise cancelling. My fire alarm could go off and I\u2019d barely hear it, and it allows you to be super immersed.Controls are super intuitive, and the volume onow is well made and easy to use. Very tactile feeling to it as well, you can tell how loud you\u2019re making it by feel alone.Cons:Very very rare, but the audio has cut out a few times, but often it was only when my controller had low batteries, and it was very minor and quick, didn\u2019t effect me much.The Jack seems slightly too small, and I\u2019ve had it like out once or twiceI don\u2019t like the plug in mic system. I really wish it was a foldaway or pivoting instead, but some people might think this is a pro. It does make it super easy to replace the microphone with a higher quality one, but I really personally just don\u2019t like having a boom mic in front of my face unless I wanna detach it",
          "The noise cancellation is crazy good! you don\u2019t hear anything literally, the bass is very good on these and the sound is very clear, I would 100% recommend this to anyone!!",
          "This one is just perfect for my regular game life.Couple hours. My ears so comfy. Sound play is great.  Quality of voice talk.  great.",
          "I really looked forward for those headphones. My old ones got warned out and i needed new ones on a limited budget and those had such good reviews.i will start with the good - VERY comfortable. i can wear them for hours, with glasses on, and feel completely fine.The sound is ok with the dongle, but the sorround just feels off and echoy.. the stereo is good for the price.I ended up using SteelSeries dongle that i have for about 7 years now which is still holding up to this day and making every mid headgear to a top headgear.I would still recommend those ones, it is almost perfect for the price, hence 4 stars rather than 5",
          "Don't get me wrong, this is a very solid headset and I'm pleased with my purchase. But I have a HyperX Cloud for my PS4 that cost me about 20 dollars less just 2 and a half years ago and the sound quality on that is about the same if not a little better.Being able to use this headset on my PC and PS4 interchangeably is huge for me though, especially since my gaming laptop's 3.5mm headphone jack doesn't support microphones, so having the USB sound card I can use instead is the only reason I'm able to play games online with friends and not have to use Discord on my phone with my cheap, busted bluetooth ear buds I bought at Walgreens for 30 bucks.I've only tinkered with the USB Sound Card options in the app you can use but it seems really good, just limited by the actual quality of the headset. Surround sound accuracy sounds excellent though, and overall audio quality is still a hair above \"good\" I'd say.The microphone however sounds really nice for what it is. I sound really clear with very little, if any, sound being picked up in the background. Also build quality of the headset is simple but very solid, and it's incredibly light and comfortable. Hours of use with absolutely no discomfort. 10/10 there.Overall I don't regret the purchase at all, but just know you are getting what you pay for and if you're looking for top of the line audio hidden in a headset 50-100 dollars cheaper than its competitors, you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for a versatile and relatively cheap headset option for PC and consoles, this is an easy get.",
          "I use headphones every day, for gaming, music, and work calls.  I've been a long term fan of Razer, and when my old Kraken headphones wore out, I upgraded to these after plenty of research.  Needless to say, I've been quite pleased with the performance.  Where my old Krakens had an obscenely long cord, this set has a nice length that doesn't get in the way or get tangled easily, and comes with a cord keeper.  Having a removable mic is also nice when I have no need for one (just don't lose it), and I've never had issues with voice clarity or volume.  Ear cups are spacious and comfortable, and made of fabric, not pleather like the Kraken set, and the headband over the top is likewise comfortable.  I also find it quite nice that the soundcard is inline with the cord, and plugs directly into a USB 3.0 (compatible with older USB ports too).My only complaint would be that the side volume knob on the left ear cup sticks out a bit too much.  I've never had a problem with it getting caught or anything, but I think it looks a little goofy with how unnecessarily tall it is.  It could easily be shorter and still easy to manipulate.  Also, the mic mute button on the back of the left ear is a little small (sometimes I press it and forget to unmute, but that's user error).",
          "I went with this headset after my Turtle Beach decided to break. At first I was a little disappointed as the people I was playing with said I sounded like I was in a tunnel and far away, however after jumping into the software side of things and making some adjustments this headset is amazing. Quite the upgrade from my more expensive Turtle Beach headset. Sound quality is great and infinitely adjustable to your preferences. Would highly reccomend.",
          "I got these for working remotely, the goal was to give myself a more portable option that an XLR condenser mic with a separate USB audio interface and a scissor arm. Something I could tote around with a laptop. The Razer Blackshark V2 delivers. The audio quality on the mic is acceptable with the caveat that I spent hours in the Razer Synapse program tweaking the settings and trying to find some combination of options that I could live with. Now, I think I still sound VERY tinny compared to my more professional dekstop audio setup, but for the price, mobility, and comfort I have found these are capable of producing acceptable microphone audio quality. The biggest problem I ran into is that the mic on the Blackshark V2 doesn't pick up lower tones as clearly as higher ones, and apparently my voice is on the low side.At least I had the option to tweak the settings because before getting the Blackshark V2 I had tried the Razer Kraken V3, and there is no fixing the audio that headset produces. Those were my second Razer product ever and my first Razer headset, I was shocked they put their name on something that shoddy. If Razer hadn't been having a sale that made their products an attractive price at the time I'd never have given their headsets the time of day ever again.The comfort on these is fairly good, nothing extraordinary to me but I usually take meetings and listen to music through audiophile quality headphones and I often put custom earpads on them, so my standards are very high. These certainly exceed what I would normally expect from comfort in a set of headphones at this pricepoint, but I find them to be less comfortable than your average Sennheiser headphones. The cups are a bit more shallow with the default cups and rest closer to my ear than I would like. Replacement pads are at the top of my shopping list for these, though I do like the breathable jersey material on the outside of them.The audio quality is acceptable. I honestly haven't even considered using these to listen to music or play games, and in meetings I have much lower expectations for the audio quality others bring to the table than I do for myself. But at no point has the audio quality jumped out to me as being bad. I ran a quick 3 track audio test just now and they're very bright sounding, which is to say these seem better tuned to produce higher frequencies than lower ones. They don't spark joy in my inner audiophile, but they're not bad either. This is acceptable audio. A sound that I think most people will find agreeable unless they're especially bass hungry. For those of you who are Dankpods fans I can offer an excellent frame of reference, you can barely hear the bongo player going off in Earth, Wind, & Fire's \"September\" with these.One notable feature that I've not encountered before (because I have gone out of my way to avoid using headsets) but really appreciated is the sidetone. I don't like closed back headphones and stick to open backs unless I'm listening to music in a public place. And I REALLY hate talking with closed backs headphones because I can't hear myself and I feel like I'm yelling. The sidetone option these offer takes in and plays ambient noise back to me so that I can hear myself and the world around me in real time. It may seem like a silly thing to want but for those of you who feel the same as myself I can promise this is a LOVELY feature to have.",
          "I have always enjoyed Razer products, and these headphones are damn good as always. Great sound and can wear these for hours comfortably. I use an external mic on a boom arm mostly but the detachable microphone is decent.",
          "They sound pretty good.. Not the best but they are not terrible expensive either so for the price they are pretty good\u2026",
          "Very fast delivery. Good quality product",
          "First off, ignore the dude that was like \"omg these things suck because I didn't follow the directions!\" My husband recently started streaming, and there's been issues with audio quality, a lot! So it was time to get some new headphones.  We needed ones for the PC and my first step is to look by price, highest to lowest, because we all know you get what you pay for!!! But these headphones are there to prove that wrong!!!!!!! Immediately installed the graphics card that comes with it, and registered. I was happy to see how much software comes with it.  Not just audio software, but an additional one for gaming that helps to boost your games! Then it was time to test it!!!!Whatever you do, go on youtube and look up something like \"The Tucker Experience, 3D audio.  And prepare to be amazed. Now, it's an awesome audio to listen too, but it tell you \"no headphones, use earbuds!\" I think this product wasn't available when that video launched because these headphones took you to a whole new level of 3D audio!!! There's a part where a knock is at the door, and myself, my husband, and my two kids all looked up when we heard it because it's THAT realist.I'm shocked, and amazed at not just the quality, but the price.  One of my biggest issues has always been the fact that I wear glasses, if you don't this part isn't needed for you.  I get headaches super bad with any headphones I've ever used, while wearing my glasses. It's like baby Jesus is punishing me for going blind, and they just squeeze the braincells straight out of my head! But not with the Razer Black shark v2! I didn't even realize I was wearing my glasses, because the design is so on point! So blind folks, we finally have a pair of headphones!!!!The quality is just out right amazing, the spatial sound is freaky and awesome for gaming. COD has just gone to a whole new level!!!! Like before with another set of headphones, priced well over these, I know someone was right or left, boo boo with these you know exactly where that punk is at!!!! Game on!! I'm so excited about these that very soon, I will get my own pair, and totally wearing them when my husband is at work.This is an amazing product!!!!!",
          "Got this on sale for half price and couldn't be happier. Feels very high quality and works great. I would pay full price.",
          "I'm a long time gamer who enjoys many different types of games, but until recently never owned or used a gaming headset.  The Razer BlackShark V2 is a great headset that checks off nearly all of the boxes.First off, this headset is incredibly comfortable and most times you forget you're even wearing it.  The cushioning on the earpieces is very soft and comfortable.  The Razer BlackShark V2 also has really good noise cancelling quality as well.  Most importantly, this headset has really great sound quality.  You can really hear the difference between the lows, mids, and highs.  It makes the gaming experience very immersive.  I've revisited games I've already played through just to hear the difference this headset makes, and honestly it has made a big difference.  I'm currently re-playing Alien Isolation and it has made an already intense game even more intense and terrifying, being able to hear all the little details and being able to hear sounds in your left or right ear, depending on where they're coming from.  I also really like the fact that Razer used a very flexible fabric cord, so I don't have to worry about the wires shorting out over time.  The headset also comes with a nice carrying case.My only complaint is that you have to essentially turn up the volume all the way in order to reach a good volume level sometimes.  On some games this can be taken care of simply by adjusting the in-game sound settings, but others will still sound slightly lower than preferred even with the settings all the way up.  However, overall this is a great gaming headset that provides a quality experience, especially for the price.  For anyone looking for a quality gaming headset without spending a lot of money, I would definitely tell them to consider the Razer BlackShark V2.",
          "I love the THX Spatial Sound option for both music and gaming, feels very immersive! And most importantly, the noise cancellation system is on point!!! Razer never ceases to amaze me \ud83d\udc9a",
          "I bought these as a gift for my bf who streams on twitch. The wired headset has a detachable USB sound card. The sound card improves the audio a LOT compared to just the audio jack. This headset also has earmuffs that are a more breathable mesh material, which last much longer than pleather (especially if you sweat). Super easy setup if you follow the instructions. Overall worth the money for someone who is going to use them every day for gaming.",
          "I had purchased a Kraken set because the Amazon listing claimed it worked for PS4. It didn't, so I called Razer to ask them about it, and they clarified that it's PC only and the listing was misinformed. So I asked them if they had any other wired headsets like the Kraken that have THX surround and a USB connection but work for PS4, and they told me they didn't. Bummed, I started looking around Amazon more and found this. It has all the same features as the Kraken, plus it works for PS4, so Razer either lied to me or the person who told me that simply didn't know what he was talking about.This headset suits all my needs, and my only complaint is that I prefer to use the USB connection on a headset over the 3.5mm jack, but the USB cable here is too short for me to use it. If they added another two feet of cable length that would be great, but since it's too short for my purposes, I have to use the 3.5mm jack. I also notice occasional momentary drops in the audio, but I can't tell if that's the headset or the game causing it, so I put four stars for sound quality since it might be the headset but it might not be. Noise cancellation isn't total, but I prefer to be able to hear a little beyond my headset anyway in case something happens or someone needs me.",
          "No complaint on quality of sound from game or music. However, the mic is way to quiet, and picks up too much background noise. Voice quality also bad. Slightly better when not routed through the sound card, but still not great. Even routing through sound manager did not end with a good result. Do not purchase if you are looking for something for streaming and are expecting to sound good to others. Returned as there was no reason to keep it, if I couldn't use the sound card and have the good mic sound quality advertised. Check online reviews, including Youtube and reddit. The mic issue is well known. Wish I had researched more in depth before ordering. If you are looking for a budget headset with great sound quality for music and don't care about the mic, then this is for you.",
          "I needed to restart my pc to get the surround sound to work, it sounds a bit weaker than the razor kraken headphones but it seems mostly fine to be used as music headphones.also detachable mic unlike the lesser costing on, I like that.",
          "I've had these and used them 3 to 7 days a week for at least 2, and up to 12 hours at a time for about a year and a half. For the price, they're very comfortable, sound great, and the mic works well when tuned via Razer's software for my quiet and scratchy voice. Not a bad deal for $90, they will continue to be used until I find something better, or they break.",
          "Okay! So I did my research on mid budget headphones for gaming. The ones I looked at ranged from $50-150. I looked at gaming brands like Razer, Logitech, HyperX and studio level brands like Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, and AudioTechnica.As far as sound quality, high/lows, surround sound, and spatial audio the studio brands win every time but for a higher price point and usually minus an integrated mic. If you're big into streaming/music I'd recommend the studio level headsets with a stand alone mic. You can buy a mod mic for most studio brands but I didn't want the extra purchase on top of a more expensive headset.So I continued my research with gaming brands.I own a pair of HyperX Cloud II's and love them for at home gaming but are simplistic in build. I wanted another pair for travel that still met the quality of studio level headphones. Logitech and HyperX have great mid budget headphones but lacked the spatial audio in the cheaper models I wanted for games like Hunt: Showdown which is extremely audio heavy and requires 7.1 surround sound. I turned to Razer as my final option which I honestly avoided due to their popularity and increasing price. I'd definitely call Razer the Apple of the gaming community since you're paying for the name, reliability, and consistency of their products. I have to co-workers that recommended the BlackShark V2 headset. I verified with my own eyes the WIRED headset has a 3.5 mm jack for the new Xbox controllers. I loved the detachable mic for travel, a mutable button on the left ear, and and volume control knob for quick adjustments.The comfortability is amazing and on par with my Cloud II's which I can wear all day.The mic is sturdy and clear.The Spatial Audio is night and day compared to a $20 headset off Amazon.They are easy to adjust and durable for travel needs.***IMPORTANT NOTE***There is a difference between the BlackShark V2 and thr BlackShark V2 THX.I got the sound card THX model to which I found out from Razer customer service that the Razer THX Synapse application IS NOT FREE....This application allows you to tweak your audio levels for your personal needs.It's a one time fee of $20.But if you claim ignorance to Razer customer service like I did because I really didn't know they will give you a one time 50% off code.The regular BlackShark V2 7.1 comes with the free software.The difference between the two??Apparently, the THX software is their version of \"premium audio software\"...Anyway! I love this headset and highly recommend it for your travel gaming needs.I bought a used \"very good\" condition one for $30 and have had zero issues.Hope this review helped someone!***8/30/22 Update***Unfortunately, after using this headset for 2 months the spatial audio just isn't where I need it to be. The 7.1 surround sound doesn't do anything for in game audio detection even with Razers Premium audio THX program.Picked up some a Phillips and AudioTechnica headsets.",
          "im not a headphone guy when i use pc buttt, this one feels comfy, sounds really good, not only for gamers music is also good, bass, mids lows highs. if you like this design go for it  sound is really cool \ud83d\ude0e",
          "This is one of the most comfortable headsets I've worn. Voices are very clear, but music is lt as full as other headsets I've used, and certainly doesn't approach \"good\" headphones. But for voice chat, it's great.",
          "This headset is alright overall. However, it is acting up sometimes - sound would disappear or gets muffled in one side of headset. This has been like that since I got it! Still gave it 4 stars, because it seems like I just got unlucky with this thing\u2026",
          "This is a great headset. One thing I like the most is the cloth ear pads.Fits perfectly and the sound is great both for hearing and talking into the microphone.  Use this for gaming for many hours and no problem so far. Had them for about 2 months now and friend recommended them to me after he has had them over a year.",
          "Great noise cancellation",
          "Because the audio was really low when the knob was all the way. Finally after adjusting the Xbox Series X I was able to fix it. I had the audio headset set to 50 percent. With that said. Wow. It has just the right amount of bass sound along with clear treble and the volume can be loud. I have to adjust the volume to about 40% not too loud not too soft. All in all. I am happy with my purchase. I bought used but like new and saved on $$ :)",
          "Have a wire with no notches as the sizing adjustment is not the best way to get things done in my opinion. The size is constantly changing while I play and fiddle with them. Besides that they've been perfect.",
          "I'm a fan of the volume nob being on the side of the headset, for starters. I wasn't ready to spend big money on headphones just yet and I was worried I had been too cheap with these as I waited for their arrival, but I've found these to be a worthy compromise. The sound is an improvement from previous headphones for music, and they seem good for games so far. I don't find myself removing them from heat or discomfort and they don't seem to emit too loud a frequency for the sound cancellation as other headphones I've owned in the past have done which tended to force me to have to remove them just to soak in some quiet from time to time, not these though. I've had these for a few months and can't seem to find anything I hate about them.",
          "Los aud\u00edfonos son buenos para jugar, el sonido envolvente super, qued\u00e9 un poco decepcionada con la cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido y con el software que lo actualizan cada rato pero que no funciona bien la verdad, a veces no me escuchan, tambi\u00e9n los utilizo para llamar, funcionan una hora y luego debo cambiarlos o usarlos sin el software.",
          "I visited a large number of aggregate reviewer websites to find which headphones I should buy. I aggregated the aggregated results and found that these headphones absolutely meet expectations at the price point. As I do not have experience with professional professional grade headset devices, I can't speak to their quality in comparison to devices that cost several hundred more dollars. However, for what I paid, I enjoy them immensely, as does my gaming community, who couldn't actually figure out who I was when I tried these on because they were used to my previous headset, which was so poor of quality I sounded like an entirely different human being. Excellent clarity for both microphone and audio output. I do wish they had a mode to hear ambient sounds so I could occasionally hear my wife complaining about my lifestyle, but then again...not really.",
          "Have had this product for a year and 2 weeks, getting it set up was a little weird, using the razer adaptor to usb my mic quality was horrendous and echo like no matter the tuning. Ended up swapping it for my extension used for my old HyperX setup. Surround sound is great for footstep audio and situational awareness, and audio quality is great for the price. However, unfortunately the connection to the aux piece that plugs into the extension has worn out. If you jiggle the wires the audio cuts out even though a good connection is made. Since it\u2019s just over a year old, I cannot get it replaced as Razer has a 1 year warranty for corded sets. 4 stars for the time used.",
          "I bought this because they were for sale for a reasonable price but I have astros and the sound quality is way better and louder. But once again for the price still a good deal",
          "Passive noise cancellation was surprisingly good. Sound is great. I prefer wired devices. Nice one Razer. Outperforms headsets above its class.",
          "Have had a constant variable low frequency buzzing noise from the left ear piece not long after I purchased this headset. Typically, during loud FPS games, I don't notice it but when listening to music or more quiet activities, it is noticeable. It is usually tied with bass. Many other users report the same issue with this set and no troubleshooting methods work. It does sound great, with good bass and the spatial audio helps with FPS games and better awareness. However, when this is used through a 3.5mm jack to a sound card, there are compatibility issues. I've had to constantly play with the settings with certain games to get the sound right and for the spatial audio to work. It is somewhat glitchy. I have since submitted a warranty support request to Razer, i am now a month into it and still have not received my advance replacement. Customer service is poor at best. They will tell you their RMA team sent you an email but you'll never get it. They finally sent me the RMA email but it wasn't for the advance replacement option I selected so they don't even listen to you. Have fun with a back and forth email with their warranty team and maybe they will eventually get you a replacement, or send yours back saying its fine. Very frustrating and I will move to Logitech for headsets from now on.",
          "I listen to audios everyday for 8 hours. They work really good and cancel out the noise around me so that I can hear clearly. The microphone for meetings works really well. One of the better ones I have ever tried"

If it's not to your taste, you can adjust it pretty easily in the app (I increased the bass just a bit and they are perfect now). They are pretty light and the clamping force is not uncomfortable. The range on the wireless connection is just amazing, they are connected to my pc on the second floor and I can go downstairs and go to the backyard and it still doesn't cut off. That's at least 30 ft with MANY walls in between.Couple potentially negative things that I noticed: They don't offer much noise cancellation but I don't really need it so it's not a problem for me. The mic is pretty bad, I have a standalone mic so I don't use the one on the headset but if you are planning to use the mic on this when you are playing games, it will be a torture for your friends.The biggest issues for me was that there isn't much space in the earcups, so my ears are constantly touching the side of the pads or the fabric that's covering the driver. At first it was irritating my ears a lot to the point that I considered returning them but after a couple days of use I either got used to it or the fabric started to get soften and stopped irritating my skin. Couple be a different experience for someone else.",
          "",
          "So my son has been using another brand about 50 bucks more then these he thought he would give these a try because he wanted a nice headset without a boom mic since he has a full size microphone he uses.So we immediately noticed the noise cancelation is quite poor. The other thing he noticed was that the sound it more tinny and not very strong.When I set it up I thought it would have been nice if they included a USB-C to USB-A adapter and not a cable for the transceiver. When you plug it in it wants to install 100's of megabytes of software.One thing that was a big problem for us though is that we could not get Fortnight to work with this headset. I set it up as default output for windows sound configuration and in Fortnight settings we set the headset up for output device. But for some reason voice chat from users on fortnight would come out the main speakers on the computer and not the head set. We could hear the sound of fortnight in the headset and other games worked fine in the headset. Not sure what was going on.",
          "The mic is bad",
          "Was really great (5 stars) up until they stopped turning on after 3 or 4 months of gaming use at my desk. They still work with the headphone jack so I guess I will keep them. Maybe its just an issue with my set but who knows.",
          "Headset cracked on the side and is no unusable after 6 months. I'm a streamer, and I take care of my equipment so this isn't from any impact or misuse. It is just defect/low quality.I really enjoyed the convenience of being able to connect to my phone and PC, then switch between the two with a press of a button however this functionality got pretty inconsistent 2-3 months later and only worked at times if the dongle was removed and placed back into the PC which is another negative.Now I get to wait 6-8 weeks to see if they'll honor the MFG warranty... yay.",
          "I got this headset to use for gaming on my PC. I primarily got this because it is wireless and I was looking to de-clutter my desk. The sound quality from these are good and they were easy to setup to both the 2.4 ghz wireless and the bluetooth. I like the fact that I can quickly swap sound between my computer and my phone. The battery life on these is great and they are very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that according to people I game online with, the mic is not very good. They have all made complaints that I am hard to hear. This is a big issue since one of the primary reasons I got this is to communicate while playing games. It does come with a jack to plug in a microphone so I will probably be trying that. It would be nice if Razr had microphones you could buy for this headset separately instead of having to buy from a 3rd party. Overall I would recommend this if you are primarily looking for a headset to listen to your games or music and want the ability to take the occasional call, but if you want these to use primarily for online gaming and chatting they are not the best option.",
          "I wanted headphones that would be good as a combo video call + music + gaming headset and these do all 3 perfectly. It checks all the boxes. Amazing sound quality (especially the soundstage- very immersive wide ambiance when playing games). So comfy compared to other headphones. Occasional connection issues because it can simultaneously connect to 2 devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (but that\u2019s also a cool feature). Overall for the price (I got them on sale for 65) these are better than just about anything. I got a 2nd pair in pink for my wife and she loves them too :)",
          "These were by far the worse headphones I've ever had and I've been a Razer fan for quite some years now. Couldn't have made a worse product imo. From the start there was nothing but connectivity issues. Headphones couldn't connect to the hub. Bluetooth was terrible. I can't even tell you how many timese I called costumer service only for them to tell me \"there's nothing we can do. Is your problem sovled?\" Nope! Problem(s) never got solved and I ended up with a better alternative away from the razer brand. This brand is overrated and full of themselves for thinking they could produce such a spotty product and gain from it. Never again will I use Razer headphones.",
          "These are by far the best Razer headsets I have ever used. The quality of the materials feel really premium. They remind me of my higher ens Sony noise canceling headphones. Keep in mind with the ones I got here, the standard Barracuda not the pro, there is no built in active noise canceling. However the large cushions on these provide a good amount of sound isolation in my opinion.Battery life has lasted me an entire day and the charging is surprisingly quick. The Razer Synapse provides a ton of customization and I could spend days just tweaking the EQ on these.One other reason I choose these over the Pro version is that the Pro does not have the 3.5mm headphone jack and sometimes that is something I just need especially when I have forgotten to charge them.Just a really solid mid to high level headset.",
          "I will try to contact customer review here and see if they can replace the headset. I would hope this is an issue with my unit. Sound is great. Bluetooth/wireless connection & distance is awesome, mic is bad (and sometimes it bugs you need to turn off and on again to get at least decent mic back), and my unit started breaking in 1 month of use, it has cracks on the left side. The mic quality I can handle, but if in 40 days of use it already has cracks I doubt it'll reach 6 months of use. It's my first Razer, only had Corsair's before, they all lasted for 2-3 years each.",
          "Pathetic Quality Control. Arrived and was super exciting, great headset until the dongle died within a week of owning it. Useless. Do not purchase.",
          "Very comfortable! I have issues with pressure points on my head, and this doesn't bother me as badly as most over ear headphones I've tried.Features that are great, comes with a dongle for the computer, but can attach with bluetooth as well, and interchangeably. So, it transfers seamlessly.Another thing that is great, is if you set them down, they power off, so they don't waste battery. However, our skull candy evo crusher headphones are still superior. Those stay on when not in use and the battery lasts FOREVER.The microphone on these are superior, though for cancelling out background noise when I'm using them for voice over edits on my vlogs.",
          "Unlike many people who buy these, i did not buy them for gaming; I wanted a good pair of headphones with a mic (no boom) that I could wear all day when I'm in the office.I primarily used these with the Razer USB-C dongle connected to my work PC. I installed the software and found that while music sounded pretty good after going through the setup, the moment I got on a Teams call, everything sounded far away and I had to turn the volume way up to hear anything. This lead me to disable the Spatial audio, which lessened the audio quality a bit when listening to music, but made my teams calls so much better. It also made is so that I didn't have to adjust the volume up/down when switching from music to MS Teams.The battery life has been amazing, after using them for a full day to either stream music or be on conference calls, I think the lowest I've seen the battery get is 60%, and that was a 10-hour workday!They charge via USB-C and turn off as soon as you plug in the USB-C cable to charge them, which I liked because I didn't have to think about turning them off at the end of the day, just charging them to be ready for the next time I'm in the office.For the price, these are better than a lot of office-grade headsets if you primarily make/receive calls on Teams and want to listen to music when not on calls. I've asked people on calls how I sound and all of them said that I sounded pretty clear and had no issues hearing/understanding me.",
          "The sound is pretty natural; I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it flat, though flat might be the closest term since the default EQ is set flat, or maybe \u201cnot overly HiFi sounding,\u201d would be a better description. The audio from this headset sounds good straight from the box and doesn\u2019t sound overly EQ\u2019d, not super bassy and not tinny; plainly put, I\u2019d say the audio quality is above average for gaming headsets.You can adjust the mode and EQ settings in the Razer Synapse app on a PC, as well as mic settings and sensitivity. There are preset EQ settings available in the app and you can even set a custom setting. I\u2019m personally not overly concerned with EQ because I use a third-party EQ on my PC that allows me to use settings for any headset or speakers I use, but it\u2019s a good feature for those who don\u2019t have a third-party EQ, especially since Microsoft removed the EQ from the recent versions Windows. You can also see the current battery level in the Synapse app, so you never need to guess how much battery you still have left. I also love that volume is controlled using a volume wheel, instead of buttons and that the mic mute is a button that is either depressed or out, allowing you to check it by touch. Having built-in mics is nice because you don\u2019t have a boom mic to snag on other things or get in the way of your beverage and your mouth. It might be a bit of an adjustment, and you may need to mess with the mic settings in the Synapse app to get things set up in a way that works for you and your environment, but that level of customizability is a good thing, so take a little time to get it dialed in, and you shouldn\u2019t need to mess with it again. The sound from the built-in mics was clear, but could probably benefit from a little gain.You can use this headset while it\u2019s plugged in, HOWEVER, it suffers the same shortcoming that I noticed with less expensive wireless headsets, and that is only charging over USB-C. You still need to have either a Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, or secondary wire using the 3.5mm cable for a connection. For those of us who prefer that 2.4 GHz link, that means still using a second USB port for simultaneous charging and use. I ask, why? Why no audio connection over USB-C while charging? It\u2019s not a HUGE deal, but come on; It seems like that shouldn\u2019t be a difficult or expensive adjustment. If you have the spare ports, or you have a USB hub, it\u2019s really not a big deal, but I find it to be mildly inconvenient and annoying when theoretically, USB-C should be THE perfect connection.The 40-hour battery life is massive compared to many other wireless headsets. I only charge this headset about every 2 weeks or so, with usage being a few (maybe 3 - 5) hours each night. Your own experience may vary depending on your own usage. And finally, the ear cups and headband are fairly comfy and very breathable, only starting to feel it after many hours of it being on my head and ears without taking the headset off.The Razor Barracuda has features that dealt issues I found with other headsets, such noisy mics, or no way of knowing if your mic is muted or not without having to remove the headset. The plethora of USB-C, USB-A, and 3.5mm cables allows you to tailor your wire connections for use and charging. The USB-C 2.4 GHz dongle makes it easy to set up low latency wireless connection with your device, and the Bluetooth connection provides a way to use your headset for basic wireless use, though I\u2019m not a huge fan of Bluetooth for gaming or watching videos, even with low latency. That\u2019s one of those \u201cI\u2019ll tolerate it\" while I\u2019m traveling type things for me.If you have $150 to drop on a headset, this is very much a worthy contender. Is it worth it to splurge and spend about $100 more for the Pro, or to save about $50 and go for the X, instead of the standard Barracuda? That\u2019s really up to you. I personally feel aiming for the middle on this one gives you the best bang for the buck.",
          "My old hyper X headset was wearing out  from constant use. So I decided it was time to buy another headset but this time I wanted to try one with blue tooth ability as well. After a lot of searching I settled on the Razer Barracuda X. After getting it setup in window 11 they seemed to work fine though Sometimes I would get some breakup with the Mic. But after about 2 weeks all of a sudden it just stopped working. you could power it on but after 5-10 seconds it would auto shut off. I've tried about reinstalling drivers and updating software but to no avail. I'm now back to using my old hyper X headset.",
          "The Razer Barracuda headset is definitely an upgrade compared to my Turtle Beach headset I have now. It came nicely packaged and ready to use. It came with the wireless headset and includes a type C dongle, USB C charging cable, 3.5mm cord, and type A to type C adapter. The quality of the headset is nice,  it's comfortable on my head and my ears. I'm able to wear it for a long period of time without discomfort.  It looks sleek and simple, and it's easy to use. I love that I can use this headset at home or I can take it on the go with me. I've been able to use it for my PC, Ps4, and mobile phone just fine. The sound quality is great, it's loud, clear, and even has some bass to it. I'm able to hear every little thing clearly when I'm playing Call of Duty and Apex, which has definitely improved my game. The mic is built in,  unlike my other headset, and I prefer it that way. The mic works amazingly, my voice is clear without an echo or static sound. I have to say I'm impressed with this Razer headset. I'm so happy I got it and would definitely recommend it. This is exactly the wireless headset I was wanting. Goodbye Turtle Beaches and Hello Razer!!!",
          "Super easy to switch from Bluetooth to 2.4ghz with just a double tap you can use it at the same time with your ps5 and iPhone , confortable, really good sound , and long battery",
          "Build quality is better than i've expected. Sound is rich. During the game sessions i can hear all the spectre.",
          "I had really high hopes for this item since I own multiple razer products. This is my second time getting a defective item from razer extremely disappointing.",
          "Battery lasts a long time not bad at all for the price the only annoying thing is sometimes bluetooth disconnects but everything has that issue honestly.",
          "For the price, no way anyone can beat it! you can connect multiple devices at once, which has activity comes on.  Plenty good sound quality, build quality is above expectations, skip sony, buy this!",
          "My Corsair HS70 Pros broke, and I thought I give these a try. I watch reviews which the mic sounded ok, so I gave em a chance. I thought the sound quality was pretty good. If using on a PC, you get full control of the headset via Synapse but no amount of adjustments made the mic sound good to teammates on discord. I was described as being in a trashcan down the hall with no warmth or depth and tinny.Clamping force on my melon felt good and the headset is nice and light. I prefer the cloth like earpads over the leatherette ones which is why I went with the mid-grade set. Cables are premium and build quality felt good overall. Unfortunately, the mic issue was enough to return these.",
          "I bought this specifically for mobile gaming and so far its been great. I do have a larger head and it fits comfortable enough to play extended lengths. The ear cushions go around the ear and do not sit on your ear. I do prefer astro a40s style of adjustment though.The headset feels somewhat cheap considering it's mostly if not completely plastic so be careful stretching/flexing it.",
          "I like the form factor of these, and they are comfortable to wear, far more so than my Turtle Beach pair. They are bulky but soft and I can wear them for hours without feeling discomfort.Sound quality is great, but I do not blast mine. As far as the noise cancellation, they are not the best I've ever used, but for a gaming headset, they do a pretty good job. I love the dual microphones, they are pretty effective, and I don't have anyone complaining they can hear background noise, even when there's a lot going on in the background. You can use in wired mode too to ensure nothing ever disconnects. The USB-C dongle is pretty reliable but the more dongles, the bigger the hub you'll end up needing.Battery life does pretty well with these as well, again, far superior to the Turtle Beach set I was using before I got these.I think my biggest gripe is that at this price point I would have liked to have a carrying case included.",
          "broke in a month !!",
          "The headset is amazing! I love the audio output and the lack of a cord helps a lot so I don't have to keep taking it off to walk around my house. The size is a bit smaller for the ears and it might just be me but they hurt to wear for more than a few hours on end. For gaming, they are alright, the only issue i have is just that the mic is far worse than the hyperx quadcast standup mic I already had, so unless you already have a clear mic, I would still recommend this headset. The battery lasts a long time and the ways you can charge it and plug it in are very useful. Overall if you got the penny to spare, go for it, worth the price.",
          "headphones are great for gaming, they're comfortable last long and deliver good sound quality, But they need assistance when it comes to the microphone. The mic is mid and i would suggest getting a stand alone mic to go with the headset.",
          "After months of using this headset for playing online with friends, I'm pleased with the sound quality. Not only for playing but for watching videos is also good. The mic is good, and my friends can hear me loud and clear when playing multiplayer games. I like to hear music while working and is excellent too. The headset is comfortable, I play for hours, and they don't bother. I prefer to use them with AUX, and until today, it's excellent.",
          "This was a gift for my son. He says the sound comes with really good quality.",
          "Estos aud\u00edfonos son muy buenos para su uso regular en una computadora ya sea para jugar videojuegos o una videoconferencia\u2026 sin embargo tiene funciones faltantes por su precio, no tienen cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido activa, los bajos son malos; por el precio uno esperar\u00eda m\u00e1s de ellos.Son bastantes c\u00f3modos, y est\u00e1n hechos de buenos materiales. Los recomiendo a personas que los usar\u00e1n mucho para jugar videojuegos \ud83c\udfae y desean mantener los mismo audi\u00f3fonos para salir y seguir us\u00e1ndolos con el m\u00f3vil.",
          "This headset has stood up to the best headsets I have used so far! It is important to note you do need to take the time to learn how to adjust the eq setting in the razer software to get the most out of this headset. With the proper settings it does a phenomenal job at whatever you throw at it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a quality wireless headset and doesn't mind learning how to adjust their eq! If you are looking for a plug and play experience then this may not be the one for you.",
          "I'm a PC Gamer and use these headphones almost exclusively for that function. To get that out of the way, these are awesome for their price bracket, easily defeating my former (and now in storage) headphones.Things I love:-Mic is built into the ear cups, yet everyone on Discord hears me crystal clear. Fantastic design there, as the moving mics tend to be a point of failure.-50mm drivers deliver great sound for gaming.-Wireless functionality is near perfect; no major issues pairing or disconnecting device. Very long battery life.Things for improvement:-The \"out of the box\" sound of the speaker drivers left something to be desired. You're best bet is to dive into Synapse with the EQ presets and THX enabled to get the most out of the headset.-Same goes for the mic: took a little tuning to hit perfection.-Initially the earcups felt small, after a day or two of usage they fit like a charm.Overall, I would recommend this pair of headsets above other brands in the pricerange. There are dual mounts from the headset to the ear cuffs, isolating a potential issue that another brand consistently has as  a point of failure. The sound delivers once tuned. THX is a nice touch, and it's great to see they didn't skimp on a license as other brands have done. It's been a long time since I've gone with a Razer product but needless to say I am impressed, and hope to see more of the same from the rest of their product lines (mouse in particular, that Viper V2 Pro is looking pretty excellent).",
          "I purchased this headset to round out my PC gaming Razor Keyboard and mouse. This headset arrived in a really nice box and that\u2019s where it stopped. I initially was using a BT connection with my PC but the volume was really low. So I tried to get the 7.1 software from razor which apparently these cans are not eligible for a product key. So I then tried updating the drivers, no change. I the decided to use the USB-dongle thinking maybe a Wi-Fi connect would improve sound. It told me the cand needed a firmware update. After firmware update, there was NO SOUND AT ALL. I spent a tremendous time dealing with these got frustrated and asked for a refund. These were the mid tier $120 wireless headphones I expected SO MUCH more. Not to mention there isn\u2019t a hint of RGB which is kinda the Synapse thing. I have to recommend you avoid these headphones.",
          "It randomly stopped connecting to the dongle. Went through many settings just to triple check. Connects with Bluetooth to the pc.. read other tickets on their website and it\u2019s not the first time. 159 bucks down the drain.. Since I don\u2019t have the receipt\u2026 the 5 months it lasted it was comfy sounded good and friends said the mic sounds good.",
          "Defective!",
          "Gave to my son for his 15th birthday, he\u2019s VERY happy with these headphones.",
          "I bought this headset and the sound quality was terrible, the earpads were uncomfortable. I ended up reordering an old Razer set I was replacing (Razer Kraken) because I  know the sound quality is good, the earpads are comfortable, and they're reliable.",
          "I ordered these headphones as a possible replacement for my aging AirPods, and so far, they're coming out on top...I've always been a fan of earbuds over headphones, for their comfort and portability. However, these headphones have started to make me a believer! They're great at my desk, at work, at the gym, pretty much anywhere I use my AirPods is a good spot to use these headphones.Battery life so far is awesome, I've been using them for about two hours a day at the gym for two weeks and they've still got 50% battery left (that's using them at 3-4 clicks of sound on an iPhone 8 Plus), where my AirPods would've been dead by day three or four.These block out a fair bit of noise, which I really like. That's good for calming the gym noise, clicks and clacks from keyboards/mice, and other background noise that combats your music for which one is louder. They're not noise-cancelling by any means, but they block out a lot more than most earbuds will.Sound quality is great, too. I used to own a pair of $250 Sennheiser headphones, and these are just as good as that pair. They don't have the most bass I've ever heard, but that's not a deal breaker for me. The overall sound quality is great!The quick-use functions are fine, and the sound control wheel is indexed instead of free-rolling, which I like. Turn the wheel a click and your music gets one click louder.The only negative comment I have on these is the size: they're a tad bulky. They're normal-sized for most headphones (especially those marketed to gamers) so I can't complain too much, but I do think they could be slimmed down just a little bit.Overall, these are great headphones! I'll definitely keep them around despite them being much larger than my AirPods, because they're just so good.",
          "Not worth the price, the internal mic is the worst I have ever heard. go with the x or Steel Series.",
          "Overall a good headset, but there are definitely some better headsets for the price, like the Nari or Kraken series headsets which have more features for games. Good if you want to use them for your phone and computer though.",
          "The headset is comfortable and light but the microphone quality is not that good. Had tried several platforms and settings and couldn't get clear audio on discord, teams and skype.",
          "I have another headset from Logitech and have been disappointed with it since I got it.I got this as a lighter headset as the Logitech one is quite big, heavy, and bulky.The audio quality is good, the battery life is excellent, and the headset is pretty light compared to others, including wired headsets I've had.People on the other end of the call could hear me very clearly without any background noise. The quality was as good as the far more expensive Logitech headset mic.The price is also fair and decent for what you get.Overall I would happily recommend this product to others, and have done so for several friends already.",
          "This headset is basically just a barracuda X with the addition of Bluetooth connectivity and the microphone is now using dual, integrated microphones (instead of the hyperclear cardioid mic that is on the boom arm). The two microphones are using beamforming and noise-canceling technology, although, the headset itself does NOT come with active noise cancellation (only the Barracuda Pro offers that technology). The driver size has also increased from 40 millimeters in diameter, to 50 millimeters. It\u2019s hard for me to personally notice the difference, but these do sounder larger, if not better (at least when gaming). Music sounds the same with both to me, and I\u2019ve never really felt like Razer headsets sound all that amazing when it comes to non-gaming audio like music.In terms of look, feel, and comfort- this largely feels the same as the cheaper Barracuda X, it does not feel more premium or expensive (at least to me). This product is designed to be a kind of two-in-one device that bridges the gap between gaming headset and over-ear Bluetooth headphones. The Bluetooth also makes it a more useful headset, in general. Or, at least it would have, if Razer would let you use both at the same time, but for some dumb reason, they think that we don\u2019t need that feature. I honestly have to limit my rating to 3 stars because of this one limitation. This does integrate with Synapse on PC and the mobile Razer Audio app on your smartphone/tablet. You can adjust EQ and make the headset sound better, as well as adjust the noise canceling microphones.I think this could be an ok option to use as headphones and a gaming headset, considering the price hasn\u2019t gone up by too much. It does seem a little compromised as the microphones are now worse and it still doesn\u2019t sound that good when consuming audio content (apart from gaming).I think I would prefer something like the stealth 700 gen 2 headset with better build quality and the ability to use Bluetooth and 2.4GHz concurrently.",
          "PROS-Excellent Music Audio Quality (Great Clarity, Balanced Sound Profile)-No Perceivable Delay (Sounds just like wearing a wired headset)-Lightweight and Comfortable (Soft Ear Cushions and Head Padding, Over-Ear)-Pairs well with Glasses-Great Battery Life (Rated 40-hour Battery Life)-Suitable for FPS gaming (My favorite pair is still the Corsair HS65 in terms of audio cue accuracy but this headset works great)-Great Aesthetics (Stealth, Compact, Simple yet Elegant; Does not look gamery)-Multi-platform (2.4GHz, Bluetooth, and 3.5mm)CONS-Price-Average Mic Quality-L-Shaped USB-C receiver may block other ports-Wireless connectivity (2.4Ghz) dropouts when too far away from the receiver/computerWow! This is the first Razer headset that I'm proud to use and recommend. I did not expect to hear such great sound quality from this at all. I had the Razer BlackShark V2 X and Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma V2 and gave both to my brother since they were disappointing in music and gaming. As a reference, my 2 favorite gaming headsets are the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 and the Corsair HS65.The Razer Barracuda sounds wonderful in music! I'm actually impressed with what I'm hearing. The clarity is great for a wireless headset! The overall sound profile is balanced. The highs are crispy and realistic, the mids (vocals) are forward and lively, and the bass presence is good without overpowering the mids or highs. The bass is controlled and extends well. The tuning is really pleasant to listen to which makes me forget that I'm listening to a 'wireless' and 'gaming' headset.The headset is lightweight and very comfortable. I wear glasses and I did not experience any issues or discomfort while using the headset. I really like the stealth look of the headset. It is simple, compact, and does not scream gamer headset. I have no issues wearing this headset at public places at all.For the downsides, the microphone is just average. My voice does not sound full but it's passable for gaming. Not really bad for a wireless mic. I also experienced connectivity dropouts when going far away from the computer/receiver. This wont be an issue for most though. The L-shaped receiver is oddly designed and may block other ports in your computer. Lastly, I think the price is a bit high but is justified by its overall quality.I'm happy to recommend the Razer Barracuda wireless gaming headset to everyone. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you find the information useful.",
          "It was not a con, I was just surprised.  Prior to these I would only get cheap plug and play headphones.  When you buy expensive headphones they need to be setup and configured.  Two close friends volunteered recommendations, the Razer \"Barracuda\"  won out because it had a discount.  I am very happy with the purchase.  The cushy ear covers are the best.",
          "What expect from my favorited tech brand but where is the rgb.",
          "While it feels comfortable it is highly unreliable, both in battery life and in function.",
          "I bought this because the picture that I saw on the listing had a mic. When I got to the page I didn't see a mic included in the detailed pics but I figured that you could still hook up a mic since there is literally a mute mic button on the headset. Don't be fooled. This headset has virtually no use for gaming unless you want to plug another stand alone mic directly into your computer."

          "These are very average headphones, and i dont think they are worth over $100, maybe like 50-70 at the most.The \"Haptic Feedback\" on the headset, which is the main selling point of this headset, is pretty hit or miss with a lot of games. for most if not all shooter games, the Haptic Feedback is very solid, sometimes it reacts for no reason, but its great for the most part on FPS. but on practically anything else, they are pretty meh, with it ruining the experience for some games. I've also found that the software needed to use the headset to its \"Full Potential\", doesn't always switch your presets/profiles you've made for say games, discord, etc. So sometimes when talking in discord, while not being in a game, the haptics will react to the voice of the people in the call, which is very annoying, and not supposed to happen, since my preset for everything other than fps games, has the haptics off. So the haptics shouldn't be on whatsoever. The Haptics will also react to the voice of people in a discord call while you're in a game as well, which isn't entirely its fault, but its still a bit annoying. I feel like the headset should've used the razor program to communicate with the game itself, instead of just your PCs sound in general.The weight of the headset is pretty hefty, not horrible, but not great by any means. After about an hour or so of use, it beings to irritate the top of my head, causing some discomfort, but I guess that's to be expected with what these headsets are made to do, which is the haptics.The comfort is very poor for longer sessions in my opinion. the headset like I stated before, is heavy, and after about an hour of use starts to get uncomfortable on the top of my head. The self adjusting strap at the top just makes no sense to me for this headset, I think that if the headset is gana be on the heaver side, then it should've used some foam or anything else instead to make it more comfortable while wearing. Having just a simple strap makes it easier to feel the weight on your head, which definitely isn't good for this headset.The mic quality (Especially in discord) is pretty bad, with it jumping around being to quiet and to loud, which makes no sense to me, it does the same things in game chat of say Call Of Duty, the headset mic just doesn't know what its doing. its also very random if the mic is gana pick you up 100% of the time (sometimes even picking up you breathing), or if its just gana barley pick you up unless you shout. You could probably make it sound a little better with some tools, but not to much.Now the most important part, the sound, which is very average. It doesn't sound bad, but it also doesn't sound great. For games that have a lot more \"boom\" like shooter games, the headset sounds pretty good, but for say like music, they're very meh, they're not horrible, but they definitely not good. When listening to music, most music just doesn't sound right, like as if they are missing depth, it just sounds very mushy. You can slightly improve it with the \"music\" option in the razor software, but it barley changes anything. I would also highly advice NOT to use the haptic feedback when listening to music, because 90% of the time, it completely ruins the experience, vibrating at random points for seemingly no reason, and the sound of the vibrations toning out the actual music.Overall, these headphones where very dissapointing, and are not in anyway worth more than $70. if you are in the market to buy a headset, and youre willing to spend over $100 for one, I would highly recommend the Logitech G733 OR the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro, both sound better, weight a lot less, and are only about $20 more than the Nari Ultimates. So Please, just get one of those, instead of these, they will treat you way better than these would.",
          "Updated Review:So... it's been about 6 months since I bought this and now it doesn't power on. Won't charge, won't power. No led indicator. A TINY bit of online research into the problem shows that this is not an uncommon problem. All it takes is taking it apart (voiding warranty), unplug the battery for a half hour, then plugging it back in. Please don't support a company that sells a product they know has a common flaw.Original Review:This headset has NO adjustment for fitting on your head and it's made for people with VERY large heads. I have a relatively large head and still have problems. Bending over to pick something up either needs adjustment to place the top over the back of the head or holding on to it to stop it from falling off. I attach it to my phone when mowing the lawn and it is near constantly trying to fall off.Audio quality is nice most of the time. Seems I randomly get ticks and pops when there's sounds with higher frequency audio. Reminds me of record player dust. Turning it up louder seems to remove the problem, but it still pops up randomly.Mic quality, like every headset I have tried is abysmal. Only picks up higher frequencies. Sounds like you are talking over a phone. In fact, I'd say the microphone in my phone is way better quality, which is disappointing for something in this price range. I'll stick with a dedicated mic for most of my gaming sessions and online calls. It is nice to have the range of an RF wireless system like this with a mice though. Bluetooth is a smidgen to laggy still for gaming and the RF system this has on it has no noticeable lag.The haptics are really REALLY odd at first, but after getting used to them, I find they can be super helpful for letting you feel bass without having to crank up the volume.The volume knobs sit at a bad spot. If you pull them down around your neck to talk with someone or something, then the knobs sit on your shoulder and they are either going to turn all the way up or all the way down. You have to figure out if it's the chat/gaming knob or the volume knob. OH! AND THE VOLUME KNOB CONTROLS THE VOLUME OF THE ON/OFF BEEPS! So if you accidentally turn the volume down, you can't tell if they turned themselves off or if the battery died, and have to fidget with it for a few minutes. Only a slight annoyance, but still.The synapse software is solidly meh, as it's been any time I've been forced to use the software. The software breaks every time I plug the headphones in to charge. Like, it doesn't crash and relaunch, just shows it's connecting to the headphones.... forever. Only way to fix it is a pc restart or going into task manager and forcing it to close.It's battery life without the haptics is REALLY good. Lasts me the entire 8 hour work day and time after work as well. WITH haptics on, it is probably cut in less than half. Whether or not you are actually listening to stuff or it's just sitting idle, the haptics drain the battery.Overall, I do think they are a pretty good headset, but they need a steep discount from when I bought them for it to be worth the cost.",
          "These sound impeccable, precision surround sound as well has the haptic feedback make them incredibly immersive fore gaming. The 2 channel set up is great for separating discord and games.The microphone isn\u2019t great my friend says it sounded a little off compared to my Blue yeti but that\u2019s a high standard to hold it too. My main problem with it was how quiet the side tone was no matter how high u turned it up. And unfortunately I can\u2019t hear my blue yeti sidetone because if u plug in the aux the wireless is turned off",
          "It's a great purchase not only for the quality that RAZER gives you, the gaming experience improves a lot with Hypersense, the sound quality is overwhelming if you play in PC or laptop it's even better because you can download RAZER SYNAPSE (Software) to take advantage of the full quality and functionality of the Nari's. It helps a lot the fact that have two physical volume controls one for the mic and the other one for the master volume.",
          "Short version: \u201clady gamer somewhat disappointed\u201dLong version: Functional for the most part, with some issues especially if you are a female gamer. Purchased this wireless headset for online DDO gaming with my Mac at the recommendation of a friend as the \u201ctop of the line\u201d for online gaming audio. Issues I\u2019ve had in the past couple of months include headset sizing, sound quality related to logon and weight. Firstly, be warned: this headset is made for someone with a minimum length eartip to eartip of about 12\u201d\u2014mine is 11\u201d so they do not fit me by at least an inch. I am not a tiny person with a small head by the way. I\u2019m 5.10\u201d and wear a standard hat size for my frame. I know other people with this issue and wish Razer considered adding at least an inch downsizing to its current minimum length. I doubt they test marketed to women or youths. It\u2019s also rather heavy, so be prepared to overcome that. I also find every logon I have impossible static that is only resolved by a logout of the game and restart of my computer. I have no idea if this is a Mac compatibility problem or if I have a bad headset but it\u2019s still essentially new so that seems unlikely. This is the only fix so far for this recurrent (every single time I play) issue. The sound is excellent, almost too much, and this brings me to another issue which is that if the sound is cranked up, other players can hear the echo. Two people in my gaming group have this headset besides me so we all know it\u2019s a problem. So, points for great sound but It really is way too loud at its highest setting (literally vibrates) and doesn\u2019t cancel out it\u2019s own volume apparently. Another design issue is that the dials do not have refined settings. You go from ear blowing, to loud, to almost inaudible. There\u2019s very little in between which is surprising to me for a brand that states it is so audio-oriented. I\u2019ve had no issues with the mic but wish the mic light was brighter, that you could set the light color for the mic and sides (why else have a light there guys?) and was simply less bulky, clunky and just plain huge. Had I product tested this headset I would have returned it for even some of the issues described, especially the sizing and connectivity problems.. As it is, I may end up giving it to a guy friend with a huge head and try to find something more compatible with my Mac.Final word:Do yourself a favor and measure your head before you invest in this expensive  headset.",
          "I've fought with this thing for almost 4 weeks and am finally returning.  Be warned, there seem to be a fair amount of people with the same problem I've had.  Synapse stops seeing the headset constantly and starts beeping.  Even on full charge or charging when plugged in, the Synapse app (pulled up on a second monitor in my case) just stops seeing the headset.  The headset beeps, but still maintains audio...it does this 3-5 times per hour on average. It also, distorts consistently no matter how I adjust EQ or balance my sound output in Windows with it.  Sometimes it will have a real fit and do it constantly every few seconds for 5-10 minutes at a time.  There is no such thing as 30 minutes of smooth gaming with it.I've opened a ticket with Razer.  Exchanged a couple of emails with the canned responses, but at the price point, I didn't want to take my chances, so it's in the mail back to Amazon tomorrow.Beyond that --SOUND QUALITY - Meh.  For a $190 headset it's not great.  The lows are muddy, the THX spatial works really well, but degrades the sound quality.  The Bass, with or without bass boost active does boom, but it's not crisp.  Also, quite a muddy/muted boom-COMFORT/FUNCTION - Excellent.  The may seem bulky, but they are light weight.  I have a big head and awful times with headsets, but these are great in that respect.  Nice mute button indicator in the mic that you can see.  Mic is retractable.  Onboard volume while DOES not control windows volume though, so you MUST use the headset wheel.-BATTERY LIFE - If this is important at all to you, don't buy this headset.  8 hours TOPS and that's with RGB lighting disabled, but using the Haptics-HAPTICS/FORCE FEEDBACK - For Gaming, Incredible in most games.  Much more immersive and natural than I thought it would be.  It's the one feature that really had me agonizing over returning these.  However, it is kind of tiring for long gaming sessions and after 3 weeks the novelty has worn off and I can take it or leave it.  I still really like it, but the initial feeling of \"I can never go back\" wore off quick.  It's still a bit of novelty.  Outside of gaming (music, movies, etc) the haptics are unnecessary at best, annoying or completely unnerving at worst.  Non-gaming application is not recommended from me on this.-PRICE/VALUE - NOT taking my technical issues into account, poor.  The sound quality is a huge disappointment for the price.  The spatial audio does what's advertised, but makes the sound quality even worse.Overall, if anyone asked me to recommend these, I would definitely say stay away.  It could be an exciting product, but it just falls short...along with the technical issue, just not worth the risk or the chance that you'll have a good experience with it based on the phenomenal number of people in the Razer support forums with the same tech issues I have had with no help, no response at all from Razer",
          "I spent a lot of time reading the review's on this Item and for a casual gamer that only uses the PC for mostly work. These headphones are amazing. Battery live is great, I have used them for a week now and I have had no issues. As with anything mid grade and above you will have to adjust settings for your mic in each app you use as the software you get for this doe's NOT change for every app. I have not used for Discord yet but Skype and Steam chat needed a bit of tweaking but not much.I do wish the range was a bit further but anything is better than wired at this point for me personally.  The sound is nice and clear even the surround sound works wonders for the price. if you are going to be using these to get away from a wired head set I say grab them.  A lot of the reviews I read and ignored were of people IMO acting like food critics they just had to find something wrong.  I got exactly what I paid for a nice comfortable head set that fits my head which is not small.  The cushions are super comfortable and have not made me sweat like my last pair.  I have played Path of Exile, Battle field 1, Diablo 3 and Over Watch.  they work great in them all. I have not used the .3 mm cable to connect to my Xbox one yet but that will change this weekend.  If anything bad I will update my review if not then its fair to assume they did their job.Last just to touch point on the volume, If  you don't have hearing problems they are plenty loud enough. Like I said you get what you pay for. With the volume up not even at full I can't hear a thing my wife tells me which is awesome :) I hope she don't read this lol.",
          "This is just my objective opinion, yours may be different. For disclosure, I am female and I use these to play games on my PlayStation 4.Haptic feedback is a big win for me. It's primarily why I was interested in this headset. It was a tad bit overwhelming at first, but I honestly can't imagine playing games with another headset even if the quality is way better. They work great with the PS4 Dualshock for an immersive experience. I honestly even like listening to certain music on them too because of the HF. So haptic feedback is a big PRO.Everything else I'm a little disappointed with. The sound quality could be better in a more affordable headset. Really, everything but the haptic feedback could be found in a much cheaper headset. I attempted to change the settings with the razor app but it was a little confusing to me what I was changing because I couldn't hear a difference on the app itself. So I just use the default settings. The biggest CON for me is the headphones are way too bulky for my head. They are lightweight but unless I position them on the top of my ears just right, if I move too fast they'll fall off. I almost sent them back over this until I finally found one position that they fit okay with. I also HATE the placement of all the extra options on the back of the headset. I'm sure it's fine once you get used to it, but it drives me crazy trying to feel for the mute button in time if I'm playing online. I'd also rather the mic LED come on when the mic is on rather than lighting up when it's muted.So basically all of the other features listed other than haptic feedback kinda felt like a fail but only because of the ridiculous price. If these were a $50-70 headset then I might recommend them. But if you're willing to pay the listed price for these, know that you're doing it for the Haptic Feedback. And even then, I'm not sure if it's worth it spending that much for it. I don't regret my purchase, but if you decide you don't like them, you can always return them. I hope this helps anyone trying to decide.",
          "I'm writing this review for PC. I've had the headphones for 7 months now. I bought these specifically for the wireless feature. Okay,, so these are my issues.Battery - While the battery seems like it lasts  a decent amount of time, for a developer that can spend 12+ hours in front of my pc in one day, this will not last all day, but I honestly didnt' expect it to. The problem is that it does a really terrible job of letting you know where the batter level is. When you get a beep you have very little time to plug them in and unfortunately the power coming from the USB port on my PC must not be power enough to compensate for the drain so it will eventually die anyway. This happened to me sever times during a skype call. My solution to this was to get a longer USB cord that is plugged to the wall instead. So that problem was solved with this workaround.Disconnection Issues - The bane of my existence now,, and the main reason why i'm actually starting to hate and really regret this purchase is that the wireless dongle is a piece of trash. I get random beeps , sometimes several in a row, because the dongle is loosing connection. The audio doesn't cut off,  the beeps are loud, but I know there is a disconnection issues because the app shows that it can't connect to the headphones. I've searched online and this seems to be a common issues with other Nari users. I have tried the firmware update but the software didn't work.Software - Unfortunately you need the software installed to be able to control the haptic feedback because while its very fun for a novelty, its a bit strong by default and unfortunately can't be controlled on the headphones themselves. I feel like there should have been a separate controller on the headphones.Minor issues - the power button, which you have to get very familiar with the placement with because by default the headphones go to sleep after 15 minutes (can be changes in software), but the power button reguires a long press. It is close to the mute button so I know why they did that, but I think the long press is only really usefull to turn off the headphones and to turn on a single press would be better.and yes, they are comfortable to wear for prolonged periods. They sound great when not beeping. I get compliments on how well the mic sounds. The haptic feedback can be a fun novelty for certain use cases.But the above issues were enough to come to Amazon and leave this comment to vent.. thats how much I'm regretting these. I am now very weary of any Razor products.",
          "I bought this headset to kinda complete my set of razor peripheralsI have the keyboard and mouse and was like why not get the headsetSo I didAnd it\u2019s a really good headset overallIt has great build quality and has some really cool features like the haptics, which make the bass in music or explosions in games seem a lot more realistic. I\u2019m not much of a shooter player but I do play some games with loud bangs and it\u2019s quite interesting, it\u2019s kinda hard to get used to but overtime it becomes second nature.The wireless connectivity goes quite far, I\u2019m in a 700 sqft apartment and it reaches across the entire thing.Sound quality is good, had some issues with getting my music sounding muffled and such but got it fixed with the equalizer which is quite handyBut overall it\u2019s a good headset and I don\u2019t think I could switch back to a non haptic headset",
          "I purchased these headphones a little over a year ago, and felt, with my experiences, I should share a bit.  I confess, this was spurred, in part, by my frustration with the product, but also, by a desire to give future purchasers, my insight after using these Headphones fairly consistently for a year.First, for the good, these headphones are VERY comfortable.  I use them for business and recreationally.  I tend to wear them for a good portion of the day, so much so that sometimes I'll forget I'm wearing them.  The ear pads are high quality, and even with heavy use, I've not seen any wear and tear on them.  The noise canceling is top notch as well, many times, I've had people have to flag me down because I didn't hear them calling my name.  The sound quality is excellent as well, and I find the split voice and game audio channels to be a great feature.  It's nice to be able to strike a balance between a Zoom meeting and the soothing background music keeping you sane.Of course, as promised, there are some flaws.  My first experience with a flaw in these headphones came about 6 months into having them.  I noticed, when adjusting the balance between voice and game, there was a bit of static... Then one side or the other would cut out when adjusting the volume.  I fiddled with the dials and made them usable, not wanting to be without my headphones.  Unfortunately it became unbearable, and I broke down and contacted Razer support.  After a bit of communication with their support, they agreed that this was a flaw with the hardware, and sent me RMA instructions.  They followed up with me, and kept me informed of each step of the RMA process.  (When they received the item, processed the replacement, and shipped it out)  The new headphones arrived in a shiny new box, packaged up like they were brand new.  Maybe they were, maybe they were refurbished, I didn't care, they looked clean, new and most importantly, worked...  For awhile.  Here we are, again, around 6 months later, and the dials are, again, crackling when used, one side or the other cutting out unless you move the dial just right.  This, I'm willing to live with, at this point.  I'll slap some tape over the dials and deal with it, but now, the wireless headphones won't hold a charge.  There's a red battery indicator in the software...  So, now my wireless headphones aren't wireless anymore. I've also been informed by the automated support page that my headphones are outside of the warranty time...  Now, when I purchased these headphones, I passed on the extended warranty... I thought a 2 year warranty would be plenty, but it doesn't feel like a 2 year warranty when the product breaks 6 months in, then the replacement breaks around the same time in the same way, and adds a new defect.As it stands right now, Razer's website does offer you the ability to request an RMA if you feel the denial is in error, so I'm waiting for a human to review my RMA request.  If they make it right, I'll update this review, however, the repeated problems with the volume dial do seem like something a potential buyer should be aware of.Oh, and the inaudible portion of this review exists, you just can't hear it... It's my screams of frustration.**** Update ****Razer support did assure me that the warranty carried over to the new product, so that was good.  There did seem to be a connection issue with the cable causing the charging issue, which they were able to help me resolve.  Unfortunately, the dials are still going bad.  At this point, rather than get yet another replacement, I suspect I'll just be purchasing something new.",
          "Buen sonido",
          "*** UPDATE ***I still really like these headphones for the audio / haptic functionality, but am dismayed about two things. The first is that lately, they have had issues disconnecting. This could be a fault with my computer or with the game I was playing (Borderlands 3), but my friends with whom I play tell me that my voice cuts out occasionally and I will even hear the \"no signal\" beep from time to time, which is frustrating. I cannot 100% attribute this to the headphones.However, I am deducting a star (well, really half a star, I'd still give them a 4.5, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars) for comfort. These start to give me a massive headache where the band sits across the top of my head if I wear them too long. I think that's just me being sensitive, as we have since bought a set for my partner, as well, who has no such problems. Either way, I wish the band were actually adjustable instead of self-adjusting as I think it's causing more pressure than I prefer.*** Original Review ***Long story short:So far, I'm very happy with this product! The lights are cool, the haptic feedback is way too cool, the sound is clear and directional... thumbs up all around. All in all, I DO recommend this product, and I DO feel that the haptic feedback and the chroma lighting (if you're into that!) add significantly to the value to merit upgrading to the Ultimate edition.More detailed review:I purchased this headset as - like many people during quarantine! - I picked up playing a new game: Fallout 76. I've long been a fan of the Fallout franchise, but only for solo play, so I never got into 76 until the advent of the private servers where I could avoid strangers and play only with friends. Online multiplayer gaming is new to me! One of the best things is the chat, for its ability to keep me at least a little bit social while stuck at home. And for that, I needed to invest in a headset (rather than always stealing my partner's work headset while he's off work!). I figured I'd better go big or go home, so after much research, I invested in the Razer Nari Ultimate.So I come at this as someone new to headset gaming, but VERY used to computers and video games. I know the importance of being able to enjoy a game's soundtrack and still hear footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you. I feel I can accurately gauge this headset's function in that regard, and I have to say I'm very pleased. The sound is very directional and transitions smoothly. It sounds better than our 5.1 cinematic surround from our speaker setup in the living room! I find myself wanting to turn my head to better hear the sounds coming from behind me. It is immersive, clear, and high-quality.I haven't played too much with the EQ settings yet, but I have adjusted the mic volume up and lowered the rumble feature a bit, per some of the reviews. The Synapse software was pretty straightforward to navigate and has many useful options. My friends I've played with have said they can hear me loud and clear, and I can hear them just fine. No volume problems whatsoever. Also, although they are not actively noise-cancelling, the headset seals well to the ears and really does block out a LOT of external noise, to the point that I had to set it slightly off my ear to make sure I could hear my dog (who just had surgery, and was sitting RIGHT next to me) in case she started crying.Now, the HyperSense feature: I love it! I guess it's a matter of personal preference whether or not you'll enjoy this feature, but I did find it added to my gameplay. Until and unless VR much improves, tactile feedback is one sensory experience completely lacking from video games; while this is a far cry from real sensations, the directional rumble of a giant enemy's heavy footsteps behind you or the buzz of helicopter blades whirring overhead adds a whole new layer of immersion to the game. I do recommend turning the haptic feedback down slightly, however, at least when playing Fallout games: during stormy weather, the wind provided too much rumble before being turned down, and launching/closing the PipBoy menu was a shocking buzz!I really debated between this and the Corsair wireless RGB headset, which i found much sleeker and more attractive, but ultimately I'm happy with my choice. I much prefer over-the-ear headphones and find these to be quite comfortable. I'm a petite woman, but I have a proportionally quite large head circumference, and these fit just fine. No adjustment needed. The buttons are pretty easy to access, and I like how the mic can be pushed back out of sight. Plus, of course, the Chroma lights are just fun to have.My partner, who is a regular online gamer, is not much of a talker but he is an audiophile, so he has a set of really nice Sennheiser headphones to listen to music and in-game chat while he plays on his computer. He also really likes the RGB/Chroma peripherals for his desk setup. When I got this, he helped me to select it based on his knowledge of the brand and sound quality, and now after trying them, he's actually thinking of switching to this product himself! I would highly recommend them if you're planning to drop a pretty penny on headphones, anyway, and want to have all the features. You cannot find anything like the HyperSense in any other comparable product I viewed, and it is definitely more than a novelty.",
          "Bought one. Sent it back to the factory within two weeks due the headset frying itself. Sound became nonexistent.Got another one. Works well.Good headset but the quality control on these can be hit or miss.",
          "Worked perfectly used so far since December to March 100% amazing only issue the mic doesn't capture 100% of what I say maybe 90% so it could either be the app or the mic but ifits the app perfect headphones",
          "Purchased this headset for my bf who on his off days plays PC games for several hours. This headset only lasts for up to 6 hours of play time. So sadly he has to switch to his old headset to recharge the new headset. (His old headset is partially broken on the head band causing it to not hold in place for too long) Sure it's comfortable, and the sound quality is great with amazing noise canceling technology. Sadly it defeats the purpose of what it was purchased for. (To keep him from needing to use his old headset entirely) I've considered returning this headset and purchasing from the old brand he used (Turtle Beach) since we've both played almost all day with that brands headset without needing to recharge. However, he loves Razer and refuses to return them since they work well other than the battery life.(For the Devs)Maybe next time instead of showing of the specks of \"Cooling gel-infused cushions\" you'll think to show the batteries life duration. Which I feel is more important to most if not all gamers.",
          "This headset literally took my breath away when I first used it, I did not even want to take it off. Its haptic feedback system works amazingly with music, gaming, and videos. When I first got the headset I listened to music on it for 3 hours straight.This headset truly immerses you into the online world, you feel the rush. It's almost cheating to have that extra sensory capability in some games. Not only do you feel the explosions, the heavy impacts and the footsteps around you. You can actually get their positions by the intricately created headset feedback system. Razer has gone above and beyond with this headset and it is very well priced. I have bought headsets ranging in price from $300-$800 and still find this my go to headset for almost everything.Razer has amazing premium packaging for all of its products. There is little chance of it being damaged during shipping due to how secure and padded the headset is in its box. It feels like you bought a work of art as your open it up and see the slick, clean presentation of the headset. All of the product information and wires are well packaged separately in the box. Razer puts emphasis when it comes to ensuring a beautiful product presentation and delivery.For some issues though:1\u2022 The headset seems to need some initial break in. Some games and movies have very intense bass heavy situations (typically where there's a heavy ambient bass tone) that will at first challenge the headsets capabilitys. In which it will start cutting out, but I found that after using it for a couple day's that went away when going through the exact same scenario.2\u2022 Another issue you may come across is the mic, the entire headset literally shakes. Meaning the mic does as well, when I first tested it while talking with some friends they said it was like being next door to a club and hearing the constant bass. Personally I use a separate high quality mic so this wasn't to much of an problem for me but I can definitely see it being an issue for some.Just to list off some other great features:Truly wirelessChroma customizationSuper comfortable paddingPlenty of ear roomEasily wearable for hours(even 16 hours straight, I did have to have it plugged in a few times during this.)Adjustable HapticsGreat quality build and sturdy frameAbsolutely no wireless delayQuick charge (this surprised me)Great customer support (if even needed)Thank you for taking time to read my review and I hope it helps you with any concerns you have have about the headset.",
          "This headset is pretty steep in price for what it offers, if you want a headset that gets the job done with some compromises and the price doesn't bother you, then I'd say go for it. Haptics bring a level of depth other headsets cannot offer (acts as a subwoofer).Pros:+ HapticsI'd say this is the primary reason I'm keeping the headset. The feedback provided by the haptics in combination with THX surround is pretty nice. Hard to go back to a regular headset. You can think of it as a subwoofer on your head.+ SoftwareSome hate it, I think it's fine. I didn't notice the issues mentioned in other reviews, synapse 3 works well.+ SoundLike mentioned above, games that support THX will sound amazing. Noticed with fake forced surround that audio will sound muddy, for the ones that support THX sounds pretty great. 50mm drivers are used, dynamic range is good.+ ControlsVolume slider for master and chat audio is VERY convenient, mic monitoring and a visual indicator of mic status is present.+AestheticsClean muted design (Have classic black, looks like gunmetal). Plastic is painted to match the metal accents. Being able to store the dongle in the headset is pretty nice. This headset is pretty big so keep that in mind when purchasing.Cons:- BatteryIf you're buying this for the haptics, with RGB off you're looking at ~6hrs on a charge. If you don't care about haptics, you can pull ~14hrs. When wearing these, you can probably tell why the battery life is this short. The vibration put out by the motors is pretty intense at times. If you don't care about the haptics PLEASE do not buy this headset. Many cheaper options out there utilizing standard 50mm drivers. - MicWell.... it works. That's all I'll say. Sounds like an Xbox 360 chat headset. Terrible.- Build qualityHandling this headset, I think it'll be prone to breakage. The joints are plastic. At this price point a full metal body would have been nice. Based on other reviews, I'm leaning towards the negative side on this one. Need to be careful with this headset. With it's automatically adjusting strap comes the caveat of it tending to not have a snug fit so shaking your head will knock it off.-",
          "The good stuff:1) Sound Quality. Razer has vastly improved their hardware and sound drivers. I sampled razer headsets available 7 or 8 years ago, and they were terrible. They looked nice, fit nice, but the sound quality was god awful. Not so here. The haptic feedback gimmick is IMO, a bit gimmicky, but nice. It's really a nice feature and does a good job at mimicking the feel of being in a movie theater during the loud action scenes when explosions are going off. I thought the feel would be something I'd want to disable but I rather enjoy it. The THX spatial audio is also a nice touch. I've gone back into Final Fantasy 14 which is one of the supported games, and it is NICE.  But not nice enough to save this headset from being returned.The bad stuff:1) Battery life. There is a reason there isn't an estimated battery life on the box or Amazon product page. It's terrible. After about 3-4 hours this headset starts starts giving off the low battery warnings. Sadly for all the great tweaks that and adjustments you can make in Razer Synapse and THX Spatial Audio software/driver suite, there is no meter telling you an accurate battery life level. There is a small meter equivalent to that of a cell phone reception. It has a fully charged icon, a slightly depleted icon, and a red almost dead icon. This short battery life is likely due to the haptic feedback feature.2) Headband is too short/small. I tried this headset on in store at a Best Buy and it fit snugly, but comfortably. I didn't realize how tight was until a sat down for some gaming sessions. After about 2-3 hours the headset press up against my glasses and head tightly. If I didn't wear glasses it might not be as bad, but this causes my glasses frame to press down into my ear or into my skull. Not a good feeling. I have a second set of glasses as back that are a thinner frame I tried as well. Sadly, this didn't help. The headband is too short / headset is simply too small for my head.3) Razer software initially detected as a Trojan by Windows Defender (Windows 10). After doing some research online, it looks like when an earlier version of Razer Synapse launched (and was subsequently loaded on to all Razer hardward / USB dongles out of the factory) it could override network admin settings to install it's drivers. Ex: If you bring your mouse to work and plug it in, even if your work's IT has locked down your computer and prevents software installation, the software overrides the permissions and installs anyway. The last update I read was the typical corporate responds of \"we are are aware of the issue and are working to address it\". Apparently it was never addressed. :-(",
          "I had been in the market for some headphones for quite some time. I went through so many headphones that I think Best Buy probably hates me now lol. No joke, I went through 3 different headsets until I found these. What caught my interest was the Hypersense technology and let me tell you, they are no lying when they say that it's like having subwoofers on your ears because that is exactly what it feels like when you turn these up. I play a different variety of games so I was able to test how these headphones would work with different types of games and they sound great! My only gripe with these is with the mic. The clarity isn't as good as something like the HyperX Cloud Alpha S. I definitely noticed a difference there but the only multiplayer I usually play is COD and that's just with friends. If you plan to stream with these, I would recommend a stand-alone mic. The quality is not horrible but it's definitely not one of the best. The fact that they will shut off after about 10 minutes of inactivity is a great feature but you do have to manually turn them back on. Not a deal-breaker for me but it does save battery life. One thing I will let you know is that they don't sound as great as they do right now straight out of the box. It took some time to get the adjustments just right. I went to a couple of forums to get ideas and made my own adjustments from there. Again, not a deal-breaker for me but it's definitely something to take into consideration when getting these headphones.Pros:-Great sound quality-Hypersense makes games immersive unlike anything I have heard before-Good battery life, even with the haptic feedback turned on (software updates probably helped with that)-Incredible bass will all types of music (sometimes haptic will need to be adjusted but not a big deal for me)-Saves your audio settings if you want to connect these headphones to a different device with the AUX cableCons:-These headphones are huge! Definitely won't be taking these out of my house-Sound muddy right out of the box-Wireless does not work without USB receiver-Using haptic on any device will use the battery, wireless or not but that's understandable-Can't adjust haptic outside of the Razer softwareAll in all, these are great sounding headphones. If you love lots of bass then these are definitely the headphones for you",
          "Be careful around the plastic where it mates to the ear muffs, if it scratches there it seems quite difficult to clean or polish out.",
          "PROS:\u2022 Metallic foundation made of a very sturdy metal. May possibly be warped at the top with intense use...\u2022 \"Cushiony\" inside materials, I've had this product for a couple months (I believe) and the ear cushions have been used intensely and not like a shoe that needs to be broken in the cushions appear to be firm and strong just minor warping I assume from \"ripping\" the headset off my head in small frustrations in intense games.\u2022 Headset rotates seamlessly, no fear of the headset breaking apart by how much you rotate, or bend it.\u2022 Sound can be turned up to uncomfortable levels perfect for the watching that movie with the needed intensity.\u2022 Surround sound, THX audio clearly un-lacking and perfect for gaming and watching movies in perfect audio it is like a movie experience especially if the movie supports Dolby audio or similar.\u2022 Perfectly functional easy buttons. Microphone easily adjustable and easy to \"hide.\"\u2022 Vibration created from the unique headset is interesting and adds another layer to the headset if that's something that interests you.\u2022 Charge lasts a long time, and even if the battery dies only the haptic feedback is disabled which isn't entirely necessary.CONS:\u2022 Major drawback microphone is crystal clear, a bit too much. My friend while gaming can hear my keyboard clicks, can hear if I sip my drink, can hear a baby crying in the next room. The microphone is incredibly sensitive, and I get commented on it periodically especially if the sound is too irritating. Because of how the headset is, and microphone (on Xbox) if my volume is loud I can hear myself, there can be an echo for everyone in the party and others in the party can hear my audio coming from the speakers that are encased on my head being played from the mic, tv is no different.\u2022 I was a bit taken back by how large the headset once it does look unusual, however I've warmed up to it and it's light.Overall, almost perfect for gaming with my friends the microphone is definitely an annoyance as this headset is almost a complete package and then beyond.",
          "SUUPER awesome hi-fi sound on these headphones, better than a lot of DJ headphones out there actually, but no real way to control the vibration feedback for bass sounds due to the fact that the driver software stops the device's microphone from being able to be used in any game or even Discord.  Ridiculous.  I tried a myriad of ways to get the device to work and finally found a website with the only real workaround-- delete all Razer software and the whole headset works for game comms.  So now I can't control the XD theater impact vibrations of low sounds in games and other gamers here it in chat.  I guess I'm keeping the thing because it sounds like I'm in an XD theater and I wanted a quality wireless headset, but sheesh Razer get your stuff together.",
          "I upgraded to this from the Razer Nari Essential ($100), and caught this on sale for half off ($100).I was surprised by the haptic feedback feature, and soon after turned it off. It adds a layer of realism to games, but is a hindrance when watching movies and tv.The sound quality doesn't seem much better than my Essential, and the wireless distance is a lot shorter too. The battery life is also shorter by a good 3-4 hours. It will automatically turn off after a set time to save battery, but with full usage you'll get about 8 hours out of it.The microphone quality sounds like an early Xbox 360 headset mic at best.TLDR;Sound Quality: 6/10Battery Life: 5/10Microphone Quality: 3/10Haptic Feedback: 6/10Value: 5/10Overall: 6/10",
          "It just randomly stopped working after some time. Would not connect back to my pc and tried witty other computers. Also the mic doesn\u2019t work and only works if you have the synapse running in the background. Tried updating drivers but no luck. Had to return and buy a Logitech headset.",
          "For everything it\u2019s a good headset I love the bass and everything it has the only problem I had was it wouldn\u2019t connect to Bluetooth at all and the Bluetooth usb was messed up and was broken so I can\u2019t even use Bluetooth with it at all I can\u2019t change the settings or anything on it\u2019s just has to be default cause the razer website thing won\u2019t even find the headset unless it\u2019s with Bluetooth to the pc and there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix it so please make sure you check your Bluetooth before buying ask the person who\u2019s selling it or anything but I\u2019m in contact with razer so I\u2019ll see what happens nothing happen but the dongle was broke any one find a replacement?",
          "I have a PS5 and own the PS headphones, they sound great but wanted something with a little more sound. The razer headphones don't disappoint, awesome sound with nice haptic feedback. Battery isn't the greatest but not a deal breaker for me, they sit comfortable around my ears without too much discomfort. I would highly recommend",
          "Well, first off, I want to say I like them quite a lot. The sounds are good, the vibration is immersive, and they feel premium. I just have a few complaints, so let me get into it.1. Audio sometimes gets strange on low battery life. The sounds come through, but you'll just hear this overpowering hum that cuts through everything. It's a good way to let me know I need to charge, but the headset already gives you a notification indicating that in 2 other ways (synapse pop-up, headset light). I don't know, I suppose it's unavoidable, but it weirds me out sometimes when I don't notice it's humming and suddenly do; it comes across very loudly.2. Range is strange. For context: I work from home, and my front door is maybe 10 meters away from my workstation. If I step outside my front door, the sound cuts off unless I'm angling my head juuuuust right. It doesn't hold very long, and no matter what, it cuts off. Sometimes I'm speaking with clients and need to let my dog out to use the bathroom, and I really wish it wouldn't disconnect so I could talk uninterrupted as my dog handles its business. My calls are several hours long, and unfortunately, this leads to the occasional accident because the headset keeps me tethered. I'm not sure if it's necessarily a range problem or if it's unable to penetrate my front door that's quite sturdy. I'll experiment further.3. The mic isn't excellent, but it's fine for phone calls. Now, my computer identifies and Nari Ultimate - Game and a Nari Ultimate - Chat. It's confusing, but I've managed to select correctly. The controls for Chat/Game audio on the left ear-muff are interesting but can be strange, too. I wish that it lowered chat exclusively (Discord, in-game chat), but Youtube audio from videos gets raised or lowered along with the game audio. I get all these sources are probably hard to isolate, so I understand. Overall it's a cool feature as-is.Anyway, the biggest hindrance for me the range issue, so I gotta give the 4 stars.EDIT: I still recommend it highly. I'm able to connect the USB receiver to a USB to USB-C connector, allowing me to use it with my Samsung Z Flip phone, so that might be my solution to the range problem for now.",
          "The headset looks and sounds really good, but the mic isn\u2019t the best and picks up a lot of noise, can find something better in ghat price range",
          "Alright, I'm aware that this headset is kind of controversial, and a little expensive (at least for perhaps Razer's questionable build quality, and compared to some well-known and highly regarded alternatives like from Sennheiser, Astro, etc.)This is the Ultimate version (with haptic feedback) and while it requires some configuration, once I got it set up correctly I found it to be extremely satisfying to use in games! Gunfire and explosions are emphasized by the haptic effects and it makes those games that much more intense! You do likely have to adjust the EQ and most certainly reduce the haptic feedback to around 3/10, otherwise it triggers too intensely and at higher frequencies than appropriate.I did find that while the audio output for music is fine, the haptic feedback was always triggering and it just didn't work like you'd want it to, i.e. only activating in sync with heavy bass output. (For comparison, I have typically been using a first-gen set of Astro A50s which are excellent for both music and gaming.)Positional audio (i.e. with the virtual 7.1 output enabled) seems accurate and the headset seems comfortable over long sessions; most notably there's no discomfort while wearing eyeglasses. This is a rather large & heavy headset, however, so keep that in mind if you either have a small head or don't want to wear something this heavy for long periods of time. Also, I haven't really stressed the battery, but its life varies based on haptic feedback and RGB effects, the latter of which you should just disable because you can't see them while wearing it anyway; in my case it lasts several hours without dying, so should be fine for long gaming sessions if you remember to plug them in to recharge afterwards.Would I recommend this headset? I'd say yes, particularly if you get it on sale like I did, and especially if you just want something different than an ordinary wireless headset (and are willing to spend a little time adjusting the settings to get the haptic effects working just right in the games you frequently play.) I still recommend the Astro A50 as the ultimate in comfort & performance, although battery life can be underwhelming in my experience, at least on my 1st-gen set (and I've already replaced the battery once.)Also of note is that I haven't used the mic on this (or any other headset) as I use a desk-mounted USB one.",
          "I\u2019ve been through 4+ headsets as of now. My go to headset for years was the pulse elite headset from Sony. I loved the bass feature. When that headset broke I bought a second one but I had issues with it out of the box. That\u2019s when my journey for another headset began. So December of last year I got astros\u2019s A50\u2019s 3rd gen. Great headset but it was missing something. It had next to no base for me. I got rid of those & then got the custom one pro+. I was hoping that the base slider would at least mimic the base from the pulse elite but I was disappointed so I returned them. I might buy that headset again because I wasn\u2019t aware they needed to be broken in. I won\u2019t name the others for review length sake. Now then, I\u2019ve had my eyes on the Nari Ultimate for years now & im kicking myself for not buying them sooner. I\u2019ve been disappointed with razors products in the past & being $200 at the time I knew there would be something I didn\u2019t like. Example, I\u2019m currently just gaming on PS4 & some features aren\u2019t available for PS4 like the thx sound option.  When I went to return the custom pro headset I notice the nari ultimate was on sale for $142 so I figured, what could I lose. If I don\u2019t like them I\u2019ll return them & just buy another pulse elite & put a end to my nightmare journey. So I got them a few days ago & let\u2019s just say I HATE THEM lol I hate them because I don\u2019t think I can ever game again without the haptic feedback feature. I\u2019m no audio file but the audio coming from them were almost as good if not the same as the pulse elite but the haptic feedback pushed them way ahead for me. Now I haven\u2019t played any sports or racing games yet so I can\u2019t comment on those types of games but shooters & even story games these truly shine. I herd the audio suffers when it comes to racing games & some sport games though but I haven\u2019t played any yet. If that ends up being the case, then I would give this 4 stars instead of 5. For those types of games I\u2019ll just use my somewhat functional pulse elites.  Let me finish by saying this. If your in the market for a new headset & are a bass freak like me then do yourself a favor & \u201ctry\u201d these. Worst case scenario is not liking them so just return them. At the very least you owe it to yourself to try them out. Just know this.... once you try the subwoofer haptic feedback on your ears THERE IS NO GOING BACK!!!!",
          "This was my first wireless headset, I really liked it and probably would have kept it if I could have figured out how to fix my issues with it. Two major issues that caused me to return it were:1.) It was too big, and kept sliding off my head. There wasn\u2019t a way I was able to make it smaller or tighter2.) I play on PS5, at first the headset echoes tremendously and I couldn\u2019t turn my mic on at all without it sounding like I was holding two mics against each other. I figured it out by moving some settings around through the PS settings. But the aux cable was not fixed, every time I tried using it, the echo/ringing was there and VERY VERY loud no matter how low I moved my mic volume or headset volume.Besides that I did love the way it projected audio.. I just wasn\u2019t able to game with a headset that kept sliding off my head or ringing in my ears if I tried talking.",
          "Edit:  I just cant get over how short the battery life is on these.  You have to charge these every day or it will just suddenly run out.  And even then if your wearing it off an on for an entire day, you likely wont make it to the end.  And the mic pics up sounds from the headphones super easily.  Just not a great headset compared to others.  I still like the haptic feedback though-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have come to the realization that I have bought just about every \"Haptic Feedback\" headphone that has come out.  These being the 3rd ones that i purchase.  The first 2 i purchased ages ago, before i really started getting into sound quality, etc.Im just overall very impressed with these headphones.The sound is deep and warm.  They have a similar sound to the Monoprice Retros, and they have a similar feel to them as well.  The base is nice and strong and the incredibly roomy ear cups gives a nice sound stage so things dont really sound that muffled.  And if you are the type of person who cranks the bass so loud in their car that you can hear the rattle of the license plate, boy are these the headphones for you.  And the actual feel of these headphones is very similar to the MP retros as well.  (If you modded the retros anyways.)  The pads are big and thick, they feel very nice.  I already mentioned how roomy they are on the inside.  And the cooling factor is no joke.  I mean if you constantly wear them you never notice, but you take them off for a minute or 2 and then put them back on and its so much colder than it was a moment ago its a bit unreal.Out of the box the base is already pretty strong.  The software then comes with bass boost settings and not to mention the haptic feedback.  This will make things rumble like no ones business.  I tend to keep the haptic feedback turned down real low though as its a bit unnecessary for videos and music.  But you switch over to a movie or actiony game, you can turn that up and really get a feel for it.  The vibration is something that more grows on you, than great right out of the box.  You will likely need to dial it to whatever you think is best.But speaking of movies, the THX virtual surround sound is actually pretty decent.  Most virtual spacial and surround sound solutions i see are pretty garbage.  Then generally just add a weird sound filter to give the illusion of sound stage.  But for these, there is no weird sound filter.  They dont really mess with the sound at all.  Instead, when this is turned on, a new audio device is added to your computers devices.  This device shows up as a 7.1 speaker system.  Thus, what actually gets inputed into the system is proper 7.1 sound.  All that the virtual software does is ever so slightly adjust each of the 7.1 channels to what it thinks the sound would be position-ally for the headphones.  And it does that pretty well without messing with the sound to much.  Honestly, there is very little different between using the virtual surround sound and not because it really all depends on the source of the audio at that point.  And while its still not a real replacement for a true 7.1 system, it is tuned rather nicely for a pair of headphones.  Couple that with the haptic feedback and you have a sound system that shakes the house without disturbing the neighbors, or even your room mates.Thats not to say the system is not perfect.  The software is pretty.... bad.  For some reason, even though all you should have to select is the THX audio device, you still have to go into the software and tell it which programs will actually use the virtualization.  And i honestly cant really tell why.  The Enhancements are kind of... well i mean they work but ive personally never really liked those type of enhancements.  But along with the bass boost and haptic feedback, it offers sound normalization.  Which is great for those youtubers who cant seem to do sound design properly or like to scream in the mic much louder than the sound of the game.  And it also offers voice clarity, which is really just a mid/trebble boost to try and boost up the sound of voices.  Which is some times welcome because once again some movie makers and game makers, really like to cover up the light talking with annoying music.  (Subtitles for the win.)The equalizer does its job.  I honestly cant think of anything to say about it.  There are no fun features with the equalizer, it just does what its supposed to do.  However, i can be a bit annoying switching profiles but ill get into that.Finally, the Mic.  I actually think the Mic is really really good.  Ive used cheap mics in the past.  Back in the day i really hated some of the headsets id get simply because of the mic.  These days I tend to use the Coolermaster 751 and Sennheiser Gaming headset, which both have amazing mics on them.  I really think the mic is on par with them.  It sounds good.  I like that its easy to hide by pressing it into the ear cup.As for the negatives?I guess it has a little bit of a weight to it.  More so than most bluetooth headphones.  And the added weight doesnt really improve the battery life much.  But, not having to worry about a cable tugging down on one side of the headphones actually almost makes them lighter to me.  And im kind of used to heavy headphones.The bass can be a bit much.  If youa re a sound purist or you like a very flat sound, you may not like these headphones.The battery life is... well its bad.  You get about 8 hours which is good for most of the day but you will have to charge it pretty regularly.The dual volume control, where one knob controls the sound mix of 2 different sound devices is kind of weird.  Its supposed to be so you can turn down the game and turn up your friends when you need to.  But getting it set up to work correctly and then adjusting it on the fly can just be a bit weird.  Its a cool feature and im sure someone will love it.  But feels kind of unnecessary.  (It does mean you dont have to go digging through the menu to make that one friend who has a quiet mic sound louder though, so thats a plus.)Overall, as a person who owns an entire bookshelf covered in a variety of headphones, it should speak volumes that these have become my go to headphones.  I like the portability.  I like the sound.  I like the comfort.  I like not having to switch to a headset with a mic when i want to game with friends.  I think the haptic feedback adds just that little bit more to the sound.  Ive been impressed with the virtual surround sound.  I even like all the little features in the software and knobs.  The only real improvement i can ask for is a better battery, or a wireless charging option with a special headphone stand.  But they really have become my favorite.",
          "I've been using this headset for almost two weeks. I bought this after having owned the Astro a40 + mixamp for quite a while, a year or so? Maybe more. The dolby surround sound on the Astro's sounded fine but was never really a good replacement for having multiple speakers around your room. The surround sound on these Razer Nari Ultimate's isn't great either. Both headsets sounded like I was either underwater, or just hearing some sounds while others were being washed out, after looking around at other reviews, it seems to be just what you get with this type of surround sound and the game and your media you're playing through them will have a big impact on the sound quality as well. I turned off surround sound on my Astro's long ago and never cared to turn it back on because everything sounded so much better than with surround sound off, the same is true for my new Razer headset, but the sound is somehow even better. Small background ambient details sound clearer, environments sound more alive. Maybe it's because the headset does a better job at drowning out the background noise in my real world?The cup fits completely over my ear on my big over sized head. It doesn't SQUEEZE my head like a vice grip. There's no sharp edges or nooks and crannies to catch and pull and tangle my hair on even. The ear cups swivel up, down, left, right to make a secure fit over your ear, and they also feel comfortable when you wear them off your ear or partially over your ear. The padding on the ear cup is very soft, i'm surprised it even makes as good of a seal as it does on my ear but it's pretty good at silencing the rest of the room when I've got them on. I was skeptical about the \"cooling gel\" padding but it's the real deal. Very comfortable. Adjustable mic pulls out and pushes back in. I've not had issues where the mic is too loud or broadcasts the rest of my room. The controls for volume, and adjusting voice/game playback balance are on separate cups and while the headset is a bit bigger than what I'm used to, I don't really notice any issues with the size of the headset.The Hypersense haptic technology is nice, I thought it was just going to give me a headache because I'm pretty prone to headaches if I wear a tight fitting headset that's too loud for too long. The Hypersense isn't something I leave on, but I turn it on if I'm watching a movie. For some video games there's just too many low tones to activate the vibrating haptic bits and pieces and makes it sound like i'm listening to someone's ghetto blaster subwoofer. Turning the setting lower makes it much more subtle and makes it acceptable for my games. Used responsibly, the Hypersense haptics feature is well worth the money in my opinion.The wireless is a godsend, I've been a firm believer that you need dedicated optical or input jacks for each sound channel for a long time. I've since converted. I sit close to my pc but it's nice not having wires rigged to my scalp and tangling in my long hair. Hopefully the battery lasts longer than the one in my cell phone.The Razer Synapse software has lots of options to adjust or just turn off the lighting on the side. I like the lights, but with the lights on I get about 8 hours until the headset just goes dead without warning. When the headset runs out of juice it just shuts off, no warning, just a soft beep tone and silence, like you're in a coffin underwater kind of silence. On the flip side it shuts itself off after 15 minutes of no sound from the pc. So if your computer is idling it'll turn the headset off and save juice.It might be the most expensive headset I've owned. I really like it. $200 bucks at time of purchase, my kid will understand when he's $200(+ interest) short on his college fund.",
          "TL;DR:The \"Haptic Feedback\" feature and great sound marks its price and dominates in utility.I prefer not to wear the Nari Ult. for more than 4~6hrs, since it gets heavy and hot.Battery (5~9hrs w/ Haptic FB & w/out RGB on) is ok, but I hook mine to a wire mostly. (thank you charge & use)Bought in Dec 2019, been using it on and off but avg. 3~6hrs daily when used. (approx. 4 months)It's convenient when functional, but I find myself having to troubleshoot/adjust the headset more than I prefer.(Compared to SteelSeries Arctis Pro (no DAC), VModa Crossfade w/Boom Mic and RUNMUS K3-RGB)History:I am a hobbyist in audio production/engineer, but I mostly game. I have Yamaha HS8s, Tannoy Reveal 501as, & KRK Rokit 5s. Along with a bunch of Sony HDRs, Sennheiser HDs, and many many off brand monitors, headsets, and reference headphones. I DO NOT have the best ears, but I know what I like/looking for.The Initial Review/What I don't like:-The Razer series of programs for its line of product is convoluted in design, but passable in usage.Each program is useful, but should be centralized - like SteelSeries's SteelEngine.-For the headset settings, it's a bit confusing and can cause many user-specific technical issues.(I'm IT but even I spent some time tinkering/troubleshooting)ie. when you're adjusting your mic features: noise cancellation, side-tone...etc verses Discord/other programs' mic settings, plus your OS system mic settings, I know this is normal but oh boy Razer likes me to tinker with it-The Chat/Game Dual Channel is great, allowing you to control the mix (important when you need to lower chat and focus in on game audio in competitive gaming settings) but its crossfader (although w/a good adjustment distance) is located on the left rear ear cup and easily touched when putting on/taking off headset. (causing many muting accidents which I'm guilty of, but the design of the headset is a crime)-Same w/mute or power buttons, either I keep pressing them by mistake when putting on/taking off the headset.-The headset gets heavy, and non-adjustable, but grips your head comfortably. (some wiggle)-The Cooling Ear Pads aren't all that, especially I get sweaty fast and after long hours (more than 3hr)-USB Dongle only w/no BT mode for mobile devices? My goodness, proprietary products WTH.-The mic, although retractable is above mediocre in quality at best. (w/ or w/out EQ config. tinkering)The Dark Meat of My Review:I cannot praise the \"Haptic Feedback\" magnet/motorized feature enough, since at the time of purchase was the only one(reasonably affordable) of its kind. This feature (when correctly adjusted, for me to set to 30) truly enhances your listening/gaming experiences.ie. Space Marines games from WH40k every step is heard and felt, truly adding to immersion.COD:MW/Warzone you know where you enemies are coming from (more on this later)Gun shots in most games, you feel every shot, impact, and result adding meaning/value to your experiences.Did you want a home theatre experience without a real 7.1 system? You too can have it on the Nari Ult.Being a studio engineer wannabe, I prefer most of my EQ to be flat even when for enjoyment.But compared to the acoustic profiles and output of other headsets (SteelSeries Arctis Pro (no DAC), VModa Crossfade, and RUNMUS K3-RGB) I find Nari Ult. being the most accurate headset. Meaning, in COD:MW/Warzone(2019) I can always accurately pinpoint enemy movements based on audio feedback. Again I don't have the best ears, but my in-game performance speaks for itself. I feel(not prove) that the 7.1 surround sound feature is very accurately portrayed through the Nari Ult.You probably noticed there are more Cons than Pros, but for what I paid for (approx. $175) and the usage so far;The Nari Headset overall is convenient when settings are aligned with the stars, but you will first pay the toll with many micro adjustments/learning curve.If you're wondering if there's a Mid to Semi-High End headset under $200 w/haptic feedback, this is it.But if you strictly want better comfort and ease of access & use, just get SteelSeries Arctis Pro without DAC. The sound is 2nd to Nari Ult. but 1st in comfort and overall design, and priced cheaper.Bonus Facts:-The included charge Micro USB cable is nice, but short if you want to charge & use.-Turn off RGB lighting to conserve battery (kinda defeating its purpose)-B/c you're paying more than $100, get a case for it (I got Casematix Gaming Headset Travel Case Bag for $20)-Or a MoKo Headphone Stand for $12 to hold your investment.-Honestly, I bought this specifically for the haptic at that price, and the only thing that did not disappoint.-If you're able combine VR headsets with the Nari Ult. or haptic sound features... you're in for a trip.",
          "For the money, good comfortable great sounding headphones.The bass response is really descent. you get your moneys worth. i have zero complaints. everything is configurable using the razor software. The Haptic feedback is awesome. shakes your head. you can turn the intensity up or down it is software controlled. It activates as the bass hits. These things are stupid comfortable too. The overall build quality is excellent. They provide you with a USB transceiver which is found in a little compartment on the right speaker, a 3.5mm cable for connecting it to your xbox controller and a usb cable for charging and i think usb audio to headphones (dont quote me on that part) the usb cable is also your charging cable. it just uses standard usb micro B so nothing special there which is really good.yeah zero complaints. My old headphones were corsair HyperX. they sound alright but are completely weak compared to the razors. You really do get what you pay for. i've never forked out 2 C notes for a set of headphones before. but i think i'll modify my habit a bit and from now on, i'll pay more for good sounding headphones.I listen to a lot of bass, techno bass, dubstep, rock music old and new pretty much everything but mainly techno stuff. I'd buy another set of these down the road if these ever die. so far the battery is good too. full charge i've been listening to techno and dubstep at 70% volume (I like it loud) with the Haptic feedback at 60% for the last 5 hours. no issues so far. Still going strong, and my ears dont ache at all. the Corsair HyperX always made my ears ache after about an hour. i've also been piddling around in the house listening to music no real problems. occasional dropout in signal but that is to be expected. The transceiver is low field low power so its range isnt very far. going through walls is a huge challenge for any consumer wireless digital signal.....an update about a year or so later....i've been listening to these headphones almost every day now. i still dont have any complaints. the construction is holding on and there's no damage to them yet. i dont abuse my stuff though. nothing is falling apart foam is holding up still.i moved into a different apartment since i bought these. there are about 20 wifi networks around my immediate area. causes dropouts now just simply because those networks are 2.4ghz and so is the usb wireless dongle for the headphones. only and i mean only complaint i have is these headphones COULD be bluetooth 5.0 that would greatly cut the interference. i somedays cant even listen to these things because of the 2.4ghz spectrum being crowded. so in that case i switch to hardwired but the sound quality isnt as good because they are no longer software controlled and they are not quite as loud. i like loud music i like a ton of bass i like to feel bass i dont just listen to it.",
          "the left side in game chat volume control did not work as intended and is seems to function the same as the right side headset volume, it just turns all volume down or up. other than that i am happy with this headset and only have been contemplating whether or not to exchange this for a functioning one but i don't know if i would even use the chat volume if it was working.",
          "They worked great for the 1st week the microphone was horrible no one could understand me talking The app and software is subpar and about a month into having them my right ear started making crackly poppy noises and I don't like to turn up my headset loud. I don't like loud music or sound so it's not because I turned the volume up it just Crackled and then forgot about it and then it was. The haptics were cool to begin with but they drain the battery so bad it's not worth it. The RGB is nice I like that my computer can control it and it matches everything else is going on with my keyboard and my Other lights But to pay that much for us headset that no 1 can hear you so you don't use the mic the correctly noise drives you crazy and game and the surround sound is sub par. I'm kind of bomb because I wanted to like them so muchmuch. They are comfortable Unless you turn your head or look up then they like to try to fall off. If you don't use the haptics the battery last a decent amount of time. I would not buy these again.",
          "update 11/13/20 - 2 star retractedSo after getting a replacement in april they melted while charging about two months later. I got them replaceed yet again and instead of getting the NARI which was sold out and kept... malfunctioning. I got a different headset by Razer. I LOVED MY NARI AND I LIKE MY NEW HEADPHONES. but they do not replace that beautiful booming haptic function.... I miss them but I dont want them to melt or break again.Update 4/6/20 -1 star retractedDongle crapped out after 3 months of use, but Razer customer service is sending me a new one. im removing a star for this happening. could just be a defect. but I stand by the product. its great... when it works.3/20-ish/20 -reviewed after two months- 5 stars givenWhy I bought them:I wanted something wireless to game with and chat with friends. I also don't like people being able to hear my shows and game... noise pollution is bad. I looked at the features, there was sale going on, I had been given a 25 dollar giftcard, and I was like.... yeah those are the ones.I've now had them for about two monthsPros:+ Deep Bass & Amazing Sound QualityIf you like to feel the bass in a song, feel the ground quake when monsters appear in monster hunter or feel the power of a gunshot in doom This will be a plus for you. I love how immersed I get into the movies and tv shows I'm watching while I have these on. I only take them off when I'm laying down or of course when I go out the crib.+ Standalone Volume ControlYou can adjust the volume of the headset via a little wheel on the bottom right side of the headset+ You can Prioritize how loud apps like discord are while gaming or watching videosYou can either turn up the gaming or voice channels via a little wheel on the bottom left side of the headset+ It has a retractable mic with on headset muting capabilities and a visual marker to tell you when you are mutedThe mic can be slid back and tucked away there, there is also a mute button under the mic. When the mic has been muted the end of the mic is red+Battery QualityI might have to charge this bad boy once a day while gaming, watching videos, and chatting with friends and I can still use when it's on the charger+ The Razer Software is good for people with the ecosystemI do not have anything but the headphones and the software for now but if a wireless keyboard and mouse pop up I might need to get it, I currently only use the software to make my headset LED color purple.Meh:-/+ The connection distance is enough to where I can clean the room and jam out or maybe walk to the restroom. But if you live in a house with stairs and go to make yourself a sandwich you will be greeted with disconnection beeps and sound going in and out. I get it, this isn't a con... but I do wish I could make a sandwich and still use them.Cons:- Mic Qualityin a game, my friends have said things like \"you sound far away\" \" your mic is a bit tinny\" \"get a better a mic soon\"after playing back a twitch stream I did to test the headset back to myself... I saw what they were talking about immediately. I love the headset but I need a standalone mic to accompany it at this point. I do not plan to get rid of it.... ever. but the mic is terrible. If you're looking to stream, sing, or podcast.... do not rely on this mic for that. Maybe a game with strangers or a call among friends but that's about it.My Conclusion:I ROCK WITH THESE MAD HEAVY, but the mic quality leaves a lot to be desired. I would buy them again, and I would recommend these to a friend. I am going to look for a standalone mic because I want to stream and have a podcast. If they break or anything I'll be back to let ya'll know how the process with customer service goes. I'll also update if I do in fact get another part of the RAZER ecosystem.",
          "The sound quality is a little muffled until i adjusted the setting in the mixer. love the oversized ear cups. other headphone made my ears sore after a couple of hours. but these i can wear all night. about 6-8 hours.",
          "Edit (december 2021): Broke after 11 months of regular use. Was working great since January, even up until a few hours ago. Then i try to turn it on today, December 31st and it doesn't turn on. Thought maybe it could use a charge, won't charge with the included cable either. Now it's a $200 plastic paperweight. A quick google search revealed many others have the same issue with no support or advice from Razer themselves. One youtuber suggested removing the battery to allow it to rest for a few minutes then re-assemble the product, but i imagine that voids whatever product warranty i might have had so i didn't try that. I'm not sure how any average consumer can be expected to remove a battery that compact anyhow. I'll likely never buy another razer product again.Overview: I've been a longtime logitech brand fan for most PC accessories. After recently purchasing a razer keyboard to replace an old logitech one, i decided to try out the brand for other things. I heard great things about this headset and it does have really good sound and features. My main issue however is the limitations of the synapse software that accompanies all razer products. While it's by no means the worst, there are things that bother me. Some settings don't seem to do much of anything, such as mic sensitivity and alot of the sound \"enhancements\".Sound/noise suppression: These are really good sounding headphones. Probably the best sounding \"gaming\" headset i've ever owned. Especially for being wireless, i'm impressed with the sound quality here. I don't believe there is any active noise cancelling going on so you should still be able to hear your surroundings during gaming sessions. If you want a headset that blocks everything out completely, then i'd recommend looking for something more designed for that, as this is merely \"ok\" for blocking out sound.Microphone: Pretty bad. Though it doesn't too terrible, it's insanely sensitive. Even at low volume, the mic picks up sound coming from the headset earcups. Makes it really annoying while gaming with friends, as they can hear the echo of my game sound.Comfort: The headband is not fully adjustable but does adapt somewhat to your head shape. I have no discomfort while gaming for hours on end but it does feel a bit tight at times. The control buttons are in a decent spot but i would prefer buttons for the volume setting as opposed to a wheel... its far to easy to either crank the volume or put it all the way down while putting on the headset. The game/chat audio balance is a nice feature but again i would prefer buttons to a wheel.Quality: Extremely well built with what appears to be a combination of aluminum and plastic. You shouldn't have to worry too much about damaging the headset through normal use.Companion software (Synapse): As stated above, it's not the worst companion software i've used. But it is definitely limiting. I've had random audio driver crashes, profile switching issues, and issues with a few settings just appearing to not do anything. Alot of the sliders/settings in the mic section don't appear to do anything.Price: High but warranted. At around $300 usd, you get what you pay for with this headset. By no means do i think it's the end-all-be all of gaming headsets, but it is a really great headset.Verdict: 4/5. Despite having great sound quality and cool features (RGB, haptic feedback, etc), i was expecting a more near perfect headset. If razer fixes their software i could see myself moving this score to a 4.5 or higher. The poor microphone holds it back as well as the companion software. Otherwise a great headset.",
          "I love razor brands, I basically own every pc razor accessory out there..however i was kinda disappointed when I finally got my hands on this head set. For starters when you turn it on, you can hear the headset turn on with a weird ringing noise but it does drown out when playing a game...however only when its silent you can clearly hear it...battery is somewhat short IMO(it lasts me like 4 hours), it still uses the old micro USB to charge it VS the better option for a USB type C. I do however love how the bass sounds and the way you FEEL it when playing! yes you can actually FEEL the bass like a SUB woofer on a car. Of course its wireless Bluetooth, and comes with its own USB wireless adapter. overall for the price I paid, I'll still keep it for a year till I get my hands on a better version of this specific model",
          "I bought these headphones almost exclusively for PC gaming, and I gotta say, this made playing Resident Evil 2&3 Remakes extremely difficult. Mr.X stomping around nearly gave me a heart-attack when the headset started vibrating with every pound of his hefty boots! This added a new level of immersion for me in addition to the controller rumble, and I am very pleased with the purchase (I bought mine used, for 120, I feel that to be the only acceptable price for headphones, any higher and I walk away). I bought them because I have had my eye on them for a while, but there are never any store floor models! so I couldn't test it out before buying it, and spending 200 on headphones that have a unique feature like 'haptic feedback' is ridiculous to me. Anyway. I used these to do a work phone call using google voice on my computer as well, and I have to say, don't have the haptics on when you are on calls lol, anyone with a male voice will have a rumble effect going with the haptics, and it is very distracting. Thankfully you can turn off the haptic in Synapse, but I can see there being issues with voice chat as you can't turn the haptics off on the fly. The microphone worked for me, I didn't have any mute problems, but if I do I will update my review. The headphones have a nice gel padding that is cool to the touch on initial placement to your head, which is refreshing in the daytime, but could be a bit of a shock if you are already cold haha, it warms up quickly, but it is noticeable enough to mention. as for the overall feel of the headphones, yes they are plastic, but that makes them lightweight despite their bulk (these are giant headphones, not recommended for outdoor wear lol)TLDR;If you want to experience horror on an all new level in games, get these headphones.If you need to make work calls, these will work, just turn off haptics.If you are afraid of mute lock, use the built in mute feature of the program you are using.THEY DO NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH. I didn't realize that when I got them, which was a bummer, but they have a nice little dongle slot so you don't lose it, and they can be plugged in using a standard headphone jack (included in the box with charger as well)",
          "The sound from these are great, t he haptic feedback really takes it up another notch while gaming Overall super happy with them.The chat/game mixer dial is in a spot that I happen to touch pretty much every time I take them off or put them on. Then you need to adjust it to make sure you have a mix of both. There is no option to disable it, this should really be a software function not a dial on the headphones.I've found the distance you can be from the receiver is super short. I have to plug it into a front case port so they would stop disconnecting and reconnecting constantly in the middle of meetings and gaming.",
          "It's hard finding headset that feel comfortable with glasses. These work. Sound and mic work in discord. Bit heavy, but wireless! Mute and power button are hard to find being as small as they are. Like to have a flip mic mute. I do like the know that moves sound between game and chat. The ear muffs are what got me, not so much pressure on my glasses pressing into the side of my head.",
          "I had a set of Astro A50's that finally went bad (the mic quick working). I had them for over 4 years. After much research I decided to go with these. Not at all disappointed so far! I have to admit I was super intrigued with the haptic feedback feature.  This did not disappoint. After an easy install, plug in the dongle (I have a PS4 pro) in the back and power them up, I jumped right into a game...Apex Legends. The game sounded amazing and I would venture to say just as good as my Astro's. The fit was very comfortable. I really like the receding mic. It will work in the \"in\" position but others had a little hard time hearing me. I probably could turn up my mic sensitivity to fix this. but I don't mind using it out. I mainly like being able to put it in for storage and transport. Don't forget to hit the mute button if you don't want your fellow gamers hearing you beg for more time to finish a round.I really experienced the haptic feedback when I jumped over to COD/CW/Zombies-Outbreak. OMG the ability to \"feel\" the action was a game changer. I had a player go behind my left ear and fire his weapon and I could literally \"feel\" the concussion of the shots!!!! Same over the other ear.  I could tell, not only by sound, where something was happening but also with the feeling of the sound on that particular side!!!! AMAZING!!!I gave 4 stars for sound control because I still have a hard time hearing chat when there is a lot of action going on...i.e. warping in (Zombies) or dropping in (Apex), big fire fight or explosions...this could totally be fixed with some settings I am sure, I just haven't found the sweet spot.Overall: a great set for, what I feel, is a great price for what you get!!!! a must have!!!!",
          "I'm not sure why this headset gets so much hate. I was torn about buying this since I saw so many negative reviews but decided to bite the bullet (maybe people just don't like Razer?)I currently own the Steelseries Arctis 7, the Sennheiser GSP 500, and now this, the Nari Ultimate. This is definitely my favorite headset of the three. In terms of sound quality itself, this holds up extremely well. If you're just going to be gaming, listening to some music, and love bass, this is the headset for you.About the haptics - they are not a gimmick. They make a very big difference and are seriously immersive. I don't think I can ever go back to using a headset without it.I\u2019ve seen some reviews mention that this is heavy. Honestly, I\u2019d have to disagree. This doesn\u2019t feel any heavier than the Steelseries or Sennheiser, and sits pretty comfortably on my head. It\u2019s a little loose, but won\u2019t fall off unless I\u2019m trying to make it fall off.Just keep in mind that the battery life isn't amazing so perhaps this isn't the best for console gaming. I sit right in front of a PC and don't mind plugging this in for a while when it gets low, but it may be an issue for some users.",
          "I use this headset on a Windows computer. A quick summary is I found the headset acceptable to use for gaming and music considering I got them at a considerable discount and used some Amazon credits. If I had paid retail for them, I would have sent them back.Pros:-- I have a larger head and these things are super comfortable, even wearing glasses.-- They don't feel cheap and appear to be built well.-- At higher levels the haptic feedback is distracting, but it's a great feature at lower levels. Surprisingly it's great for games and music, but it's a bit gimicky.-- They are acceptable for music and gaming, but nothing I would call 'ultimate'.-- Setup was super easy.-- They turn on fast and connect to the computer instantly.-- If you are looking for a fool proof, easy to use, headset, this is the one to buy.-- The Synapse software is easy to use.Cons:-- Battery life isn't that great. I got about 5+ hours after turning off the lighting effects.-- If you drain the batteries, they are unusable until they get some percentage of charge. That means you can't plug them in with dead batteries and use them. Considering the batteries don't last all that long, this happens often enough to be super annoying.-- While they are comfortable e, I do have to adjust them once in a while to keep them from falling off my head.-- The dongle is plugged into the top USB port of a mid tower computer and I was getting about 10 feet of wireless range, far short of the promised 40 feet. I bought a USB extension cord. This allowed me to position the dongle up higher and increased the range. The range is still not as good as the Logitech G935 this headset replaced, but it's acceptable to walk around the house now.-- The software is workable, but super clunky to use. I wouldn't call it horrible, but Razer needs to rework it to make it easier to use. For instance, it would be nice to know the percentage of battery life/use, but no such control exists. They do have a little icon buried in the software, but it's close to useless.-- The Game/Chat balance control sounds like a great feature but I never found it useful. This turned into a con because it was frequently the cause of issues hearing the game or voice coms after inadvertently adjusting it.-- Razer support: I contacted them about the wireless range. The range was so short I thought I may have received a defective unit. They basically just brushed me off.Update:-- I gave away the Nari to a relative and bought the Logitech G PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset. I just never loved the Nari headset, or the Synapse software. When the G PRO X went on a Black Friday sale I pulled the trigger. I love the simplicity of the G PRO X controls on the headset. The Logitech GHub software is vastly superior compared to Razer's clunky Synapse software. The G PRO X stays on my head securely where the Razer's always felt in danger of falling, and did fall a few times. The G PRO X sounds great for both music and in game. The microphone, with the Blue Voice software, is superior as well. I did like that the Nari had a fixed microphone you could push into the headset when it wasn't needed and the HyperSense haptic feedback. However neither of those features compelled me to keep the Nari and I'm glad it's gone.",
          "when paired with Razer Synapse software, fully configurable sound profiles for whatever you may need.",
          "My only gripe with these are the volume balancing between the \"game\" and \"chat\" audio. The wheel on the left goes from 100% game to 100% chat with both being 100% at the dead center. There is a slight notch for this position so you can tell that you're set to the mid point but the wheel scrolls easily with even a light brush against the wheel. I suspect that this wheel would have served better as a volume for the chat and the wheel as a volume for the game."

          "I am use to a wired basic mouse. This mouse is a lot heavier to move around. I'll keep as a backup unfortunately.  I have carpal tunnel and smaller hands I think this is a PERFECT mouse for someone will larger hands.",
          "Seems to be durable, looks nice and works for our needs for a wireless mouse. I have been using logictech for years and it always holds up. Seems so far a good purchase.",
          "The mouse battery lasts a long time and is accurate with zero lag! Definitely recommend \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Mouse movement and scrolling are very smooth, with no jumps or jitters. Mouse optics are very robust on difficult surfaces. It tracks perfectly on almost any surface",
          "ive had this mouse for over 5 years and use it daily for 10+ hours. ive only changed the batteries about 3 times maybe. it goes to sleep very fast. i love this mouse. it is extremely comfy and durable. ive dropped it many times and it is still perfectly fine. the side buttons are perfect for gaming too.",
          "The Logitech M510 wireless mouse is a very comfortable and smoothly performing mouse. It is a full size mouse that nicely fills up the palm of the hand. The weight of the mouse is \"just right\". The mouse body is symmetrical so that will be equally comfortable for left or right handed people.The mouse movement and scroll wheel work perfectly smoothly with no jump or jitter. The mouse optical performance is very robust on poor surfaces. It works equally well on a mousepad, a bare table, on a pants leg, back of a book, even the palm of the hand. It tracks perfectly on almost any surface (which many other mouse brands have trouble with).These mice use the Logitech \"Unifying\" USB mini receiver which can support up to six Logitech devices by itself. If you have a Logitech mouse, keyboard, trackball, etc... they can all operate from the same receiver (saves using up USB ports). Be aware that the unifying receiver ONLY works with Logitech products and that it is NOT Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Logitech products can be \"paired\" with the unifying receiver in Windows and MAC (of course) and also in Linux by using the software package called \"solaar\" (free, open source). The mouse comes pre-paired to the receiver, so it works \"out of the box\". If you want to add (up to 5 more devices), you have to pair them yourself.The battery life is awesome. Because I hate leaking batteries, I always use AA lithium cells for everything (including the mouse). My first old Logitech MS-510 mouse that I purchased over three years ago is still working fine on the FIRST batteries that I installed in it (two AA lithium). Since I use it on my desktop the mouse power switch is always left on. It must consume practically no power when not being used.If you use the mouse with a laptop or need to move it from computer to computer, the little unifying receiver can be stored inside the mouse (in a little USB sized slot next to the batteries) to avoid losing it.What follows is some technical information that you can skip if you don't care.Construction: This mouse is very nicely engineered and can be completely disassembled by removing two little screws inside the battery compartment. No screws hide under the teflon slider pads, so those don't get damaged if you take the mouse apart. Every component then can be removed simply by sliding or snapping it out. Why take it apart? See next.My personal feeling is that the left and right mouse buttons are too light (i.e. press too easily). The buttons are no lighter than other mice, I just prefer them a bit tighter. To change this, I replace the two little microswitches with Omron Series D2F-01 parts that have a 150 gf actuation force. It takes about twice the pressure to click these switches as compared to the originals. To replace them is super simple: Just unsolder the originals and solder the new ones in place. If you forget which way they go in, the orientation is printed on the PC board.The side \"scroll\" buttons already use heavier pressure microswitches, so I don't change these. The \"middle button\" (pressing the scroll wheel) and the left/right scroll switches (rock the scroll wheel left or right) are a different type of switch that also do not need changing.If you disassemble the mouse, be aware that the little plastic slider for the power switch will be free to fall out when the mouse PC board is removed. If you don't know this, it's possible for the slider to silently fall out, never to be seen again.I won't tell you HOW to unsolder and resolder the button microswitches, because if you don't know how, you shouldn't be doing jt in the first place (or get an electronics-knowledgable friend to help). And, of course opening and modifying the mouse will void the warranty!I will give you one important hint: Because the mouse was assembled using RoHS compliant lead free solder, the microswitch solder joints should first be RE-SOLDERED with leaded solder before sucking or wicking the joints clean. This is done to \"alloy\" the high temperature lead free solder into more manageable leaded solder to avoid burning/ruining the (single sided) PC board.Good luck! This mouse (hacked or not) gets 5 stars and both thumbs up. It works flawlessly, it's comfortable, battery life is amazing and the price is good (even better when it's sometimes on sale). Grab one!",
          "Works great. Very comfortable in the hand.",
          "Exactly what I need for my day-to-day tasks. Scroll works and syncs smoothly. I used to have this kind of mouse at work, and I never complained. No double clicking issue.",
          "Works acceptably well, though I replaced an older version of this exact same model that seemed defective but may possibly have been damaged by someone.  It is not frustrating, though like most wireless mice, it has a tiny lag after resting still for some time that is not noticed during general computing, but may be an issue for gamers, which I am not.  Eventually, I hope to upgrade to a CAD quality mouse, so at least one can see that this mouse has a quality in most areas of concern somewhere between best of average desktop mice and worst of high end CAD mice.  Truly pretty good for a comfortable price.",
          "I have slightly large hands, and this mouse is a great fit. The included batteries are still going strong after six months of regular use. I wish the scroll wheel was a little more tactile, but it's still good. Would recommend.",
          "So in comparison of the older version of the M510 (pictured on the right) and the new M510 (pictured on left) I would say there is a significant upgrade especially around weight and click sensitivity. I am not sure why Logitech sells three versions of these at the same time when comparing Amazon, the official Logitech website, and other retailers. The older mouse is the one with the full Logitech name printed on, not at all, or the new version that just says Logi. The older M510 is heavier than the new, sensitivity especially with the invisible optical tracking is better on the new and works well on dark/light surfaces when compared to the old (advanced optical tracking) which struggles on white/beige surfaces. Older versions suffer from clicking that is sticky over time, the new one doesn\u2019t have this issue. However, depending on your finger length or finger placement, pressing on the ends of the clicker can cause the mouse to double click (right and left clicks at the same time) even when you clicked on one side. I find that positioning the index and middle finger to be slightly around or below the scroll wheel works optimally to avoid this problem. Any higher and you risk getting double clicks. Unifying software is great and the Logitech options works well to tell you battery indication but not down to the precise percentages, this is more or less better with the new than the old mouse. Instructions that come with the box don\u2019t explain how to do any of the customization features or how to pair other unifying software together so look up guides on the internet. The side rubber grips are cleaner on the new than the old and aren\u2019t as prone to stickiness especially with dust though it will still happen. Bottom plastic pieces on the mouse to help it glide do get scratched easily for both versions so mousepads are preferable. The left and right clicks on the middle scroll wheel is very sensitive compared to the old. When using the new, it can jump webpages, but on the old version it moves a few inches across the screen. The side buttons on the new are louder than the older versions and have a greater noise profile than the clicking of the mouse itself. If you watch YouTube videos of the M510 from 2020, they certainly have some slight changes especially in this department. The new mouse\u2019s hard plastic is pretty high quality which resists drops and scratches though it doesn\u2019t feel the same as the old which feels like Nokia\u2019s brick plastic and has survived higher drops from the table. To reiterate, yes there is a difference between the mice that say Logi and Logitech so be careful when comparing the two. Slightly flatter on the newest mouse and slightly larger, so check the product length/width/height carefully. When comparing the sound click profile of the M510 to the standard M185 Logitech mouse, it sounds less plasticky and sticky which is the same for all versions of the M510. Click speed on this mouse is better suited to the office than gaming as it is less responsive overall when attempting to click faster, unless you expect to be clicking the mouse with pauses.",
          "Long battery life, super-easy setup and durable construction and superior trackability make this mouse a standout. The incremental scroll wheel offers just enough resistance to prevent over-scrolling while being smooth and accurate. It's even comfortable in my XXL hand.",
          "I've been using this mouse for a long time and so when my last one died I was happy to be able to find another one and this works so well and fits my hand well. I like that the new mouse syncs with my previous USB that the matching keyboard also uses. Good price as well.",
          "good",
          "This device is what I needed because it works and fits.",
          "This mouse is amazing \ud83e\udd29.  Easy to hook up!  Works perfectly.",
          "I've purchased this model of Logitech mouse at least three times - every 2-3 years.  I've considered other products and read many reviews, but I have returned to this mouse every time.  In short, for my purpose, another mouse with additional functions (e.g., programmable buttons) doesn't make sense.  This mouse can be used on a variety surfaces and almost always tracks well.  The required 2 AA batteries last at least one year with daily mouse use.  I do some gaming and the \"response time\" has never been an issue.  Admittedly, I rarely play high FPS, high \"twitch\" games.  Still, this is a good choice for many gaming and most other computer applications.  It's wireless, Bluetooth-enabled, and a reasonable size for portability.  Some users may disagree, but the mouse fits in the palm and has a bit of weight, well-balanced, which provides a comfortable tactile feeling - meaning it's not a brick but it's also not pushing around (over-responding to?) a feather.  I have only had to replace this mouse when the mouse pads begin to wear flat.  At $20, it's a good value.  Recommended.",
          "I thought the usb connector was missing and didn't see a red light and thought it was broken. I don't see very well, so I don't know if the small print on the package said anything about the USB connector was in the battery compartment. My wife mentioned the battery compartment, and there it was. Everything in there is black and I never saw it when i put the battery in. Who knew.",
          "For a portable mouse it\u2019s a little larger than I expected. But that\u2019s fine because I have larger hands and it fits my hand really well and it\u2019s comfortable. No issues, works exactly as expected.",
          "Excellent Product",
          "Had an old Jelly Comb wireless mouse that was fine, but then it became balky, even with fresh batteries. Replaced it with the Logitech M510. So far, so good. Have been using it for a couple of weeks with no issues. Plugged the USB wi-fi receiver in, put the batteries in, and it has simply worked without  a hiccup since. Tracks well, comfortable in the hand. The forward and back buttons are especially helpful when on the web. Reasonable price. Probably not the ultimate gaming mouse, but not an issue for me. Can't go wrong with this mouse.",
          "I have very large hands and this mouse is great for the cost. I feel like I can use it all day without strain.",
          "This mouse has a similar feel to the Microsoft ones I've used.  This one has lasted longer than the combined time for three Microsoft ones.",
          "My Lorex N882 security camera NVR is in a closet about 20 feet away and around a corner from where I work and this wireless mouse works great.  I used to have a wired mouse and having the wire run across the floor was lame.  The dongle of this Logitech mouse plugs into the front USB port on the NVR and the mouse immediately started working without issue.  FWIW, I previously bought a cheap mouse/keyboard combo and although the mouse worked it worked very poorly.  This Logitech mouse is much smoother and more precise.  Also FYI, the keyboard did not work with the NVR...dang!  That onscreen NVR keyboard is a PITA to use and was hoping the physical wireless keyboard was going to work but no dice.  Anyway, this Logitech mouse is fantastic and I would buy it again if the need arises.",
          "I have had several of these mice and they all work great.  Just wear out after a couple of years.",
          "This mouse lasted me many years after much abuse, including being used every day for a few hours each. Finally the age started to get to it, and the scroll wheel no longer worked so I had to replace it but I chose to replace it with the same one!  Plus the price is a bonus. I use it for gaming, work/business related stuff, etc.",
          "This is my second Logitech mouse - love it! Great fit, smooth and easy to use. Size is very good.  I had tried a small one from another company thinking it would be good for travel but just did not have as good a \u201cfeel\u201d as this one",
          "This is the second one of this particular mouse.  I like how they work both on desktop and laptop.",
          "Works well but I am still looking for a comfortable mouse",
          "Generally, I like Logitech products, but the scroll wheel on this one is really loose and noisy enough that I hear it (loudly) every time I touch it. The looseness doesn't affect the performance, but I've had cheaper mice where the scroll wheel was both tight and quiet.Other than that, it's too new to rate for longevity which I expect to be fine for a Logitech product.",
          "Great so far no issues",
          "I tried so many cheap mice and then decided to try a higher priced one. I remember buying these like 10 years ago, so I tried it. It is awesome. Fits hand well, great smooth movement. I'll never go for $10 mice again. Thank you Logitech for having a quality product!",
          "This mouse is solid and sturdy and the wheel roller to scroll is good quality. I would definitely recommend",
          "This is my 3rd logitech m510. This is a pretty good mouse for the price. I have one each for my personal and work laptops and another one for my son's desktop. I absolutely hate track pads so this is my workaround. The scroll wheel is handy for scrolling and I can middle click to open links in a new tab. I have fairly large hands, but these fit nicely and are comfortable for extended use. Very responsive and the stability is good too. I think I adjusted the speed a little so the cursor isn't dancing all over the screen.",
          "I have been using one for several years.  Now that I am working at home I wanted to get one for my personal lap top rather than switching from 1 lap top to the other.  It is a great mouse (especially for my work load!).",
          "This is a fine computer mouse.  Affordable, comfortable size, a lot of features.  I have one complaint.  The back, left side has a button that shifts current screens forward and back.  This button is very easy to hit with your thumb and is very annoying when it switches the screen you are viewing.  I disabled this button with a small dab of E6000 glue and all is well!  This is a very nice mouse for the money!!",
          "Already own 4 of these and never ever had issues(Office, home, travel, etc.) Very durable and battery lasts one year plus on daily usage. My only wish was there was more color and texture options.",
          "Perfect size for me. I had to replace the same one I left behind. Used a smaller one and my hand cramped up!  Thanks for the quick shipping!!",
          "We have two at home on desktops, and one I carry to and from work. They are great! I love them!",
          "Overall, this mouse is fantastic. I have used this brand and model for many, many years. I love the positioning of the two thumb buttons. The mouse also feels great in your hand, not to big not to small.The only complaint I have, and it is only on this latest one I've purchased, is that the middle button/mouse wheel rattles and can get obnoxious. That said, I will give Logitech the benefit of the doubt, but I am questioning their quality of build.",
          "Does exactly as advertised!!!!",
          "Logitech is the first brand that gets recommended to editors such as myself, and for good reason. It's a little iffy on surfaces that aren't COMPLETELY smooth, but otherwise it works well, fits my hands well (I'm ambidextrous and interchange hands) and has a pretty good battery life.",
          "Practico",
          "Easy to operate and fast delivery",
          "This wireless mouse looks and feels great.  Simply plug in the included USB communicator (whatever it's called), and get rolling!It requires 2 AA batteries (included).  Beats the hell outta wired mouse! ;)",
          "I think I've bought probably 5 or 6 of these.  They hold up well.  They're accurate, have good buttons and scrolling.  Heck I've bought them for my desk at work because it's easier than getting IT people to get me one.  The price is great for what you're getting.  It's not rechargeable but the 2 AA batteries last a really long time.  It has all the buttons most people need.  I've had more expensive and more complex versions before, but when they broke I just started replacing them with this.  Until they get rid of it I'll probably just keep buying these forever.  If it starts tracking weird or a button fails it's literally 1/5 the price of a fancy rechargeable travel mouse and it's not too big to use as one.  Also tracks fine without a pad.  Sometimes they advertise that as a feature that costs a lot more.  This one works on any surface in my experience (haven't tried on glass - maybe tonight I'll check).",
          "I loved the quality and feel of this ergonomic mouse.logi does not disappoint. Great rest/hold for thumb index finger.Highly Highly recommend",
          "This is a fine computer mouse. Affordable, comfortable size, a lot of features. I have one complaint. The back, left side has a button that shifts current screens forward and back.",
          "Great mouse. Feels great on hand, moves nicely and good price too! Works wonderfully!",
          "I got this mouse about a year and a half ago and I use it every day for multimedia creation and general tasks. The buttons on the side are not convenient for left handed people so I just don't use them. But overall, the mouse feels high quality and has been a faithful and reliable friend."

          "I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I\u2019d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the \u201cnon-gaming\u201d mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn\u2019t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I\u2019ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305\u2019s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I\u2019m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn\u2019t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a \u201c20 million\u201d switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that\u2019s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn\u2019t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?This would have to be it for now. As always don\u2019t forget to disable \u201cEnhance pointer precision\u201d in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we\u2019ll be grateful for years to come.",
          "Perfect for girls who want a quality, aesthetically appealing mouse. It\u2019s not that great from a gaming perspective (mediocre) but it\u2019s better than any generic mouse by a long shot.",
          "I bought this mouse for the office. I wanted something with higher - and adjustable - dpi.I also have a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed (which I love) but wanted something with a more conservative appearance for the office - so I got a black one of these.I\u2019ve had it about a week, and I love it. It is extremely responsive and light. I put in a lithium battery; I might put in a AA to AAA converter with a AAA lithium to further reduce weight. I have large hands but use a claw grip - so it works well. If you have large hands and use a palm grip, this mouse will likely be too small for you.The downloaded software is easy to use - to customize buttons and set dpi. I like that it has a light to indicate which dpi you are using - and the software has a pop up on the screen when it is changed to confirm the setting.The scroll wheel is not free-wheeling, which I prefer. I like scrolling one \u201cclick\u201d at a time.I don\u2019t game on a PC, but based on how responsive and exact it is, I believe this would be a great gaming mouse.Considering how much I use a mouse at work - MS Office applications (lot of Excel), this was a very reasonable investment.Highly recommended and would buy again!",
          "There is nothing wrong with this mouse. Since owning it I have had no issues, it\u2019s functioned amazingly, and the battery life is astoundingly long. I expected it to be cheaply made because of the price, but it has held up better than my previous mouse which was a way more expensive mouse from Razor.",
          "I have this as my gaming mouse. It's awesome, it's great but in using the MX Master 3 as my daily driver, it's not great for all day use. That is the only draw back to it for me. Plus that comes down to a personal preference. If you want a good general mouse though with epic battery life, this is a good choice. If you want a corded alternative, the G502 is also valid.",
          "I wish it came with wifi as well, and a rechargeable battery",
          "mouse is overall a great wireless budget entry into gaming or for those with smaller hands. however the side buttons are mushy and hard to press consistently during gaming sessions without getting a bit creative and modding them with some paper or cardboard behind the contacts to push them a smidge closer to make more consistent contact without feeling like you have to press hard enough to possibly break them everytime. also the pbt feet on the bottom of the mouse depending on desk setup can get easily snagged on things or worn down, recommend modding the side buttongs, replacing the feet, and addings some grip tape to make it a more reliable mouse for gaming. However! it is great for general use with a long battery life off a singular AA or with a bit of modification if you like your mouse a good couple grams lighter it can be used with a AAA with some toying around.",
          "This mouse is overall good. The clicks r a lil loud but its not that annoying, glides good and very light and fast. Also comes with batteries which is helpful! Overall 10/10",
          "Logitech has always been known for their wireless keyboards and mice, and this one is no exception. In 2016, Logitech was the first to create a wireless technology that has no interference with other wireless devices, and can respond as fast as a wired mouse plugged in via USB. Ever since, Logitech's wireless gaming mice have been outstanding in terms of performance.And this mouse is no exception. While it may not look like much considering there are no LED's, tons of buttons, gimmicks, etc. Its just a pure performance wireless mouse.**SHAPE**The shape originates from the G-Pro mouse released in 2016. That mouse's shape was based on the popular G100s mouse, but added RGB and a top sensor. This mouse is same exact shape: Ambidextrous, but with side buttons on the left side only. The shape is perfect in my opinion, its a lower profile mouse but it still has a hump towards the middle for additional comfort.**BUTTONS**The buttons are not the best in my opinion. While the left and right clicks are crisp and tactile, they are a little too tactile for my taste. They're loud, have a little too much travel, etc. They actually feel even more heavy than the original G-Pro buttons. The left and right clicks are rated only for 10 million clicks as opposed to the 20 or 50 million found in other mice. The side buttons are a bit mushy with a LOT of travel, but they work as expected. The scroll wheel is a bit heavy but has noticeable steps and is still quite smooth. Overall, the buttons are decent, but the left and right clicks really need some more tension.**WEIGHT**This mouse weighs about 96 grams with the AA battery it comes with. However, you can reduce the weight by using a AAA battery with a converter, or even using an AAA battery with tinfoil. But this mouse is very popular among the gaming mouse modding community, I've seen people do some mods to this mouse to get it to below 70 grams.**FEET**The feet are just your basic Logitech mouse feet. A little scratchy, but still smooth and fast. Not the worst stock feet I've used.**SENSOR**How does this mouse have such good battery life? Well, the Hero sensor does just that. It uses the second gen Hero sensor, as the first gen Hero sensor found in the G603 was able to spin out with the tilt slam when this second gen Hero sensor doesn't. The Hero sensor was designed by Logitech to give almost the same performance as the popular PMW3366 sensor by Pixart, but at the same time, gives you almost double the battery life. It can track anywhere from 100 to 12,000 DPI in steps of 50. Has no issues with stuttering, spinouts, acceleration, etc. Feels exactly like the PMW3366. It can also be used at: 125, 250, 500 or 1000 HZ polling rate. Truly a revolutionary sensor.**SOFTWARE**This mouse can either be used with Logitech Gaming Software or G-Hub. I personally use LGS as I find it to be more stable and easy to use compared to G-Hub. In the software, you can set profiles, DPI, macros, you name it. The only option missing is your lighting options as this mouse doesn't have any LED's except the DPI indicator which is either white when you're on a normal DPI setting or yellow if you're on a DPI shift setting.**POWER**As I stated above when talking about the weight, this mouse powered by a AA battery. With that said, that means you can't use a cable to re-charge the mouse, or use the powerplay pad. But you really don't need either of those, because of the Hero sensor's power efficiency. In gaming mode it can last up to 250 hours under CONTINUOUS use. That's 10 days without a break. If you set it to endurance mode, it can last up 9 MONTHS! (Endurance mode saves by battery by limiting the polling rate to 125 HZ). But they're is advantages with using a traditional battery. First if you drain the battery or it somehow goes bad, you just replace it. You won't have to send the mouse in for RMA if the battery fails, like on the G703 for example. And secondly, they last a lot longer. Even the G703 with the Hero sensor can last up to 35 hours of continuous use with the lights on, but the G305 can last up to 10 days. See the difference?**CONCLUSION**This mouse is a GREAT choice for those who want to get a wireless gaming mouse without breaking the bank. You're giving up on the lighter weight of other mice, LED's and other features, but for the price you pay, you gotta cut corners somewhere.",
          "My son is a serious gamer. I\u2019m a nerd. So when he was explaining why he bought This mouse over another, it went over my head. Buts He\u2019s happy and that\u2019s all that matters!",
          "Update: Logitech sent me a replacement. No ghost clicks. Great customer service. Right mouse button is still too sensitive for people who rest their palm on the mouse, but updating to 4/5. Good mouse, good service. Original review below.tl;dr: I've had this mouse for about 15 months. In that time, it's gone from a pretty good mouse with a caveat to nearly unusable due to ghost clicks.I got this mouse because I was having issues with too many Bluetooth connections lagging on my computer, and the surfeit of relatively cheap, high quality RF mice made the mouse the easiest part of my setup to replace.This seems a well-built mouse: right away, the instant response time, perfect connection, and button to quickly hop between tracking speeds made it seem like I Bought the Right Product to ease my existential angst. As the song goes, \"Fitter. Happier. Right mouse. More productive.\"However, shortly after getting the mouse, the problems started. The mouse would click when I did not intend to click, from my finger just lightly resting on the right mouse button. Context menus popping up unexpectedly led to a lot of accidentally hitting 'back,' 'save as...,' or 'search with google lens.' Annoying, for sure, but not a deal breaker. I could have reached out to Logitech about a replacement, but I was able to tell myself I just had a heavy middle finger (I have been accused of such in the past) and that I could just train myself to not accidentally right-click.Unfortunately, it's just gotten worse. I used to just right click on accident (I still do; I used to too). Now though, the 'ghost clicks' have migrated to the left mouse button like a narratively incoherent trade embargo, making the mouse virtually unusable. Sometimes it left clicks mysteriously, but worse, the mouse doesn't send an \"end click\" message to the computer, so it's sometimes (but not always) a \"long click,\" leading to a dragged cursor. I highlight things when I mean to click. I double click when I mean to single, triple click when I mean to double, etc. When I hold the button down, it doesn't stay down. I'll try to drag something and it will drag it to the wrong place. It's desktop chaos, and it's got me climbing up the walls.I opened up the mouse, in hopes that it was just dirty. It was not dirty, and I don't know any other troubleshooting steps for a schizophrenic mouse click sensor.Naturally, my product support window has long since ended, and as we all know, we live in a world of planned obsolescence, so the answer is, as always: buy more stuff. Let your descendants and the seagulls worry about the microplastics we're generating at an alarming rate.Is this mouse the straw that will break the camel's back and send me to a Luddite's colony in the mountainous woods of the Olympic Peninsula? Not yet. I live for pain.",
          "Great sound clicking and great sounds and confort",
          "I love this mouse it\u2019s the most affordable gaming mouse there is",
          "Very comfortable for working as well as gaming.I needed some extra button for gaming compare to my previous Microsoft mouse I bought 7 years ago.The mouse is more reactive, and you can easily control the sensitivity in Logitech G Hub.The mouse is also affordable.For less than $40 this was the best value for me.",
          "I rated 5/5 because I think what you get for the money is good, not because it's perfect (at the time of writing I paid $30 including shipping). I'm going to rate the aspects important to me in a mouse on a scale of 10 and give a brief description why, as someone who games competitively.Shape/Form: 9/10Medium-size form factor. Nothing innovative here but it doesn't have to be. It's comfortable to use and cups in the palm nicely.Weight: 8/10I'm still not sure if there's a point where a mouse can be TOO light. I personally haven't found that point yet. I've used lighter mice than this and didn't notice much of a difference. I don't feel any extra fatigue using this one. Make no mistake though, this is a light mouse.Buttons: 9/10It's not loaded with a bunch of extra buttons and I like that. Buttons are what a keyboard is for, not a mouse. That said it has robust mapping options in the software for the buttons it does have. I don't do any special mappings but it's nice the option's there. I had to dock a point for the left and right click. I find the pressure threshold for clicking is TOO sensitive, to the point the mere gravity of my finger resting on the buttons engages a click. This resulted in me needing to permanently flex back my index and ring fingers so they wouldn't trigger clicks. As a result I had to fold up a little piece of paper and slide it under the corners of the buttons to increase the pressure.. This was an easy hack so it doesn't really bother me. It would be nice to have some mechanism to adjust click pressure in future models though.Wireless: 8/10The reception is good, it feels about as responsive as a wired mouse. I'll only very occasionally get some response stalling for a 1/4 cm of movement of the mouse before it registers. And this only seems to happen if the cursor sits in the same position for a prolonged period of time. You also have to use a special dongle. It's not the end of the world and I understand it's for better performance, but it takes up another slot in your usb real estate and it would be nicer if I could use 1 dongle for all my peripherals instead of 2.DPI: 8/10This thing advertises 12K DPI and I bought it as a replacement for their 1K DPI standard logi mouse I got for $20. I have no way to test this but it doesn't feel 12x faster. At max settings it feels 2x faster or AT MOST 3x. Now it could be some of this dpi is being used for smoother transitions between points of movement and it does feel smoother and less choppy than the $20 logi. It's max speed setting is pretty good though. It's hard to imagine you'd want much faster than this. It could still be smoother though and if it is indeed 12K dpi as advertised then I could imagine even higher dpi's could be beneficial for the most elite levels of gaming. I think I'd prefere just a touch more sensitivity myself but this is very usable for competitive gaming and I think this would meet the demands of 99.9% of gamers.Closing Thoughts:Good mouse for the money. In the consumer electronics space in general I'd like to see some independent labs open up to test these electronics and confirm their claims of performance. I think logitech is a reputable company and I'm inclined to trust this mouse wields 12K dpi, but how could I ever confirm this? The residential electronics market has already solved this with the common UL (UnderwriterLabs) symbol marking system. This is a seal of quality and an independent confirmation of performance by an independent lab. This ensures reliable performance and protects the consumer against fraud. The current system we have for consumer electronics of relying on reviewers to write (potentially compromised) sponsored reviews is inadequate at this point. There are too many devices out there and the research expected of a single consumer to sift through this endless catalog is far too much.",
          "We needed a decent mouse for a office PC. This is not an office PC mouse.  The features on it are excellent, however, and at the price it was hard to beat.Working great on an older MacOS install after installing the correct Logitech software. The configurability of the various buttons has sold us on it.",
          "I have average size hands but this mouse feels small.  After long gaming sessions, my hand would feel tired because of how small the mouse is, like there is no support for my hand.  It would be awesome if they made a larger size mouse with all the same specs this has.  I found a few other larger mouse (full size) but they're Bluetooth and not connected via a USB dongle for 2.4 GHz.  The reason is Bluetooth is not as good for gaming as the 2.4 GHz connection.  There are lots of articles on the web regarding this if you're interested in finding more information.  Overall it's a good mouse with excellent specs, but I docked off 1 star for being small and doesn't feel comfortable for long gaming sessions.",
          "Works as well as you'd think for the price, which is good. One thing to note is that you'll need Logitech G-Hub software in order to customize the speeds on the mouse.",
          "pros- have yet to notice any issues with latency. I previously had the wired version and I can't say I've noticed a difference.- battery lasts a long time even with heavy daily use ( I use this mouse for productivity/work during the day and gaming at night). I just replaced the battery for the first time after probably 4+ months of daily use. it's led also warned me of the battery dying which is nice compared to it just dying in the middle of a game or something unexpectedly.- Marco keys are standard and generally work with every game- has a decent weight to it. Not to light nor too heavy.- scroll wheel feels great when scrolling, easy to click mouse 3, and isn't loudcons-- I would like to see a rechargeable battery version. I am tired of dealing with disposable batteries.- only has the minimum of Marco keys. if you are looking to have more that two macros, this isn't your mouse.maybe a con-- this doesn't bother me very much but it doesn't have any rgb leds to customize like other Logitech gaming gear.- some people have complained about the distance from mouse and the dongle affecting the latency. My Mouse is pretty much a foot or two away from my desktop tower and I haven't had any issues. It does come with a usb extenion cord incase this does become a issue. I know this may be counter intuitive to owning a wireless mouse, but hey at least they give you a solution out of the box and you don't have to order more cables.- if you happen to have multiple Logitech lightspeed wireless devices they cannot share dongles. This makes sense to me because I would guess sharing a dongle might effect the latency.. but if having to deal with multiple dongles turns you off then this might not be the best",
          "First gaming mouse was the Razer Mamba Elite, but was not able to overcome the issue of the cord getting in the way by trying out several fixes. Went to the Razer Mamba Wireless, and the LMB began to deteriorate within a month or so of usage. I'm not hardcore, nor do I solve frustration in games by abusing my equipment, so it was pretty disappointing to see it go so quickly.Tried this mouse out to get away from Razer. It's a bit smaller, but I think it's a very smooth mouse. I'm surprised to see that I bought this over a year ago. A few days ago was the first time, possibly the second if my memory sucks, putting a battery into this mouse. Needing a battery may sound like a turn-off, but honestly, it's not that bothersome.If you're thinking of making the jump from wired to wireless, do it. I used to think I would experience lag or hiccups making the switch, but this mouse is so smooth. I play battlefield 4, team fortress 2 and insurgency sandstorm, always do my best to ensure to keep a general sensitivity between all games. It's a smooth piece of equipment if you want a reasonably long-term piece of equipment.Overall, amazing, my only issue is the size. My ring finger grips the lowest part on the right side, and my pinky somewhat drags along the mousepad. Not terrible, but it happens.",
          "I'm switching over to Logitech G from Razer, and so far I'm loving it! This mouse is exactly what I was looking for: super responsive, fast, accurate, tactile, ergonomic, and best of all, wireless! Logitech's \"LIGHTSPEED\" wireless technology is seriously no joke, as it feels like a completely different experience compared to your typical wireless mouse. I honestly can't feel a difference between this mouse and a wired one... Well except this one doesn't have a cord attached to it!",
          "Almost thought it arrived to the wrong place but it got here as intended. Good mouse, very good price for what you're getting. Reliable and simplistic.",
          "I purchased this mouse for work, school, and to play games. I mainly use my Macbook pro for work and school and it works most of the time. Sometimes there will be glitches where the cursor will lag and zoom across the screen for a few minutes. Usually I\u2019ll just turn it off and on or wait a couple minute and the issue resolves itself. Overall for Mac use, can\u2019t really blame the mouse because Mac has awful compatibility with any product that isn\u2019t from Apple. The mouse overall hits all points for me when gaming. No lagging or connectivity issues on Windows. It\u2019s cute, lightweight, and inexpensive. I also don\u2019t have to deal with having a wire which is already a huge plus. Definitely recommend for casual gaming (GOC for me is Sims 4).",
          "I thought it would be too big for my tiny girl hands but it's comfy and lightweight.",
          "I've only had this mouse for a year, and the poor build quality is really showing through. The back thumb button won't click sometimes because the mouse is getting mishapen over time. The scroll wheel is also starting to bug and give the occasional up scroll when going down or vice versa.Updating my review to 4 stars since Logitech honored their 2 year warranty on their website for this product and shipped out a replacement that is working well so far.",
          "It's genuinely a good little mouse, and the dpi control is really nice. It's better than cheaper logitech wireless mice. It's comfortable and fits in your hand nicely too. I haven't been able to use it for gaming, but as long as you don't require 12 thumb buttons (like I do), it probably does just fine.",

          "Don't spend more money. Buy this mouse. It's comfy for all day use when working and has the features you need for gaming. Don't fall for the gimmicks and pretty lights from other brands. This is is the last mouse you'll need.",
          "good budget mouse uses 1 AA battery",
          "The side buttons are very small and the mouse is kinda like in a egg shaped if these don\u2019t bother you then this is mouse for you",
          "This mouse is great. First of all I\u2019ve had this for over a year and a half and I\u2019ve only changed the battery twice! It has 4 different speeds (more if you want to do it through your computer settings) it\u2019s ergonomically great for my hand and my dads hand and it\u2019s had no glitches ever",
          "This is definitely the best mouse for your money. If you are here because of the new release of the mouse that costs way too much money, look no further because this one is great until they drop the prices on the new mouse. Very light and easy to control",
          "Matches the white pc and still somewhat minimalistic look and feel which is my preference. I couldn\u2019t stand the cord bunching up on my crowded desk. So I don\u2019t notice any issues with gaming on it",
          "My favorite mouse is the Logitech G Pro. I have three of the wired version with RGB and it's perfect for me. This is basically the G Pro but wireless with no RGB. It's got the Hero 12K Sensor so it's accurate and the battery life is good. The only thing this is missing is Bluetooth functionality. While I understand the polling rate is much faster using the dongle, I don't mind sacrificing some speed for my laptop to have a free USB type A port.",
          "Trying to find best mouse for online multiplayer fps games can be a struggle. So many choices and companies don't really market with honesty. The 3 main things I look for are the shape of the mouse and click latency and sensor performance. This mouse covers all three.I've tested so many mouse. The sensor is important. CPI Variation is how accurate the mouse can perform moving at fast or slow pace. This mouse has an almost perfect CPI Variation. Same sensor as on the Logitech g pro wireless mouse that cost nearly 3x as much. It's pretty much a cheaper version of that mouse.Click Latency is important also. These do have omron mechanical switches. Not as fast as the wired razer viper mini V2 opticals(6ms), but on par with gpro  wireless at around 11ms. Unfortunately these will ultimately fail to doubleclicking issue, but can be replaced/fixed easily if you are tech savvy.Sensor performance is where Logitech beats Razer. The Hero sensor is the best sensor available. The orochi and viper mini fail here. Your shots will not be accurate depending on how fast or slow you move the mouse. I had to return the orochi for this reason. Could never get consistent scores in Aimlab.Shape is medium size. It works great for claw grip and fingertip pretty good. Palm grip may be tougher on bigger hands, so if that's your thing, you should look somewhere else, maybe the new kone pro air. You can also use a lighter AAA battery with tin foil or AAA to AA convertor to make it weigh less. The weight is a bit heavy with the double AA battery. You can use a AAA lithium battery to reduce weight just use some foil at the ends. The weight is way better.Alternative budget wireless gaming mouseRazer orochi- more expensive, Bluetooth, but has major sensor issues. No problem if you don't play fps games , this is more versatile. Mouse is very small though. But a solid mouse.Katar pro- cheaper but major sensor issues and shape might be an issue with hand slipping off.Steelseries- just stay away from period.Alternative wireless gaming mouseG pro wireless/Superlight- cost way more, has the same sensor. Performs great has internal battery. My 2nd fav wireless mouse. If you can't afford this, the g305 has the same sensor and performs nearly identical. You are paying for a lighter mouse with an internal battery.Glorious Model O- Decent price and click/sensor performance. Sensor is decent just slightly under par with Hero sensor.Razer Viper Ultimate- Expensive, better click latency, decent focus sensor, but higher cpi variation than g305G wolves hati wireless- decent price, haven't tested though but heard good things.Roccat Kone Pro Air- Great solid ergo wireless mouse. Sensor not as good on hero.Software looks good but can be a pain to have profile save to mouse. Saving profile to mouse gives option to not run the software in background. Issue is that sometimes the dpi doesn't save correctly to mouse. You have to create a new profile and then adjust settings and then click to turn on onboard profiles. It's buggy, sometimes the dpi will always revert to 800 dpi.ConclusionFinding the best is always a pain. Honesty isn't what drives marketing. Razer and Logitech both hype up there products and hide there issues. If only you can get the great optical mouse switches with the Logitech Hero sensor. Unfortunately that doesn't exist. Razer's new focus sensor isn't widely available on all there models yet. Roccat has made some great mice with optical switches and decent sensor performance. The roccat burst core is probably the best example of a solid mouse with low click latency and almost perfect sensor performance. But Roccat sensor performance is inconsistent between models. Some have great performance, some don't. The new wireless Kone Pro Air has great click latency but the sensor is not as accurate as g305 even though it cost almost 3 times as much. Roccat stilll a newer company and can become great because obviously logitech doesn't want to venture into optical mouse switches, which I think would be endgame.Hope this is helpful, let me know if you have any questions. G305 is still the king of wireless gaming mouse. You will not be disappointed.",

          "Update Jan '23:My replacement mouse has worked flawlessly. I use it with my work laptop. So it travels back and forth with me. It has been around 6 months since it was replaced and it is still running on the battery it came with. I haven't experienced one drop or stutter. Not one even minor issue with the mouse.Update Aug '22:I reached out to Logitech support and the mouse was replaced under warranty after the usual questions: Is the firmware up-to-date, is G-hub installed on the computer, does the issue persist on multiple computers, USB ports, etc.I'll bump my 1-star up to a 4 for the relatively painless experience. I'm hopeful that the replacement mouse doesn't develop the same issues and my prior experience was just a lemon. Only time will tell.Original review:I purchased this mouse to use with my work laptop. For a couple of months it was relatively pain free, I enjoyed it. It is a nice mouse that feels good in the hand. I did experience one or two disconnects, that quickly re-connected, in the first few months. Then, it became more of a once or twice a week it would disconnect. I'd simply swap the USB ports on my laptop and it would reconnect. Then it was more like once a day.Now in June, after purchasing it on Black Friday in late November last year, it is so annoying that I will be replacing it. Swapping USB ports no longer works. I have connection issues multiple times a day, every day that I use it. Which results in me fiddling with it, swapping back and forth between USB ports, pulling it out a little, pushing it back in, wiggling it a little... mostly to find the spot that it works again only for it to die the second I let go of the USB dongle. Which is fun when you're in the middle of a meeting.This is unacceptable. I've tried it on my two other computers, an older iMac and my personal custom built desktop. It is worse on the iMac than on my work laptop and a little better on my personal computer, but the signs are still there. I got a lemon and now I'm stuck with it. Other mice work perfectly with these computers.I've looked online and I've seen people have issues with the battery not making full contact causing similar disconnects/stutters. However, I don't think that is the case for me. I've had the mouse open, holding the battery in place with my finger, and it'll still disconnect.This is the first time I've been let down by Logitech. I have a MX518, G9, G9x, G502 and G Pro Wireless. They are my brand, but maybe it is time to try something else.",
          "As stated in the headline, the mouse is made with quality, weight, and comfort in mind. It's extremely comfortable to use with a great battery life. The only issue I've noticed thus far is the middle mouse button being a little hard to click, though I'm sure it will wear in over time. The left & right mouse buttons are quite sensitive but not too sensitive. The pads/feet on the bottom cause it to glide effortlessly across smooth surfaces.DPI - 12kWindows Sens - 3%TLDR - Good gaming mouse but MMB is a little stiff.",

Only two things I dislike about this mouse are, its a tad bit on the smaller side and when using a double A it weighs almost 100 grams. However, you can mod this mouse a fair bit and bring down the weight to around 60-80 grams depending. 8.5/10 recommend over any other mouse at this price point"

          "The G503 is an excellent mouse for palm grip or my own hybrid palm/finger grip. Although I don't use it for gaming. For desktop duty it is excellent. The extra buttons are positive even if rarely used by myself except mostly Foward/Backward side buttons. The hyperscroll wheel is very good and nice so in non-hyperscroll mode or normal mode. The finger doesn't get fatigued from scolling, there is mechanical feedback and it can jar the index finger a bit, nothing serious most likely a reason for controlled hyperscrolling without letting the wheel become a flywheel. Although the mouse wheel is excellent a pure metal one. Similar to prior hyperscroll mice from Logitech's other lineup. Much welcome improvement over the old plastic scroll wheel and older encoders of mice from yesteryears.The G503 is affordable when discounted from it's normal 50 or so dollars for a high-end mouse at about 30ish for it's current price range is a nice discount. Especially for those who wish to have a nice high-end mouse without paying high-end prices. Although there is a myriad of mice available Logitech once again built a workhorse. Funny the mouse came out originally around a few years ago and is still a proper mouse for gaming or more so desktop duties.Again gaming wise I cannot comment as I do not game anymore. But looking at websites from various tech sites around the internet. The Logitech HERO engine system(ARM 32-bit + Sensor) reveals an excellent sensor perhaps a bit dated after a bit of time but still a capable mouse for gaming. Or desktop duties as I use it for which any engine is good if you want a high/higher end mouse.The P.O.S.T.(Power-On Self Test) for the ARBG cycling at the beginning of boot for my computer during USB powering. Is an excellent idea. I have no idea if Logitech ever explains that but I'd like to see more companies and Logitech themselves mention the P.O.S.T. so the device can perform a electrical test to ensure proper operation and maximum M.B.T.F. I'm sure the ARM processor used or any processor from any company can include a routine of P.O.S.T. like a computer to run a power cycle test for normal operations.I'm sure as others can attest this mouse can last years so long as it doesn't break down or anything. Either way Logitech's return policy is considered by some to be good to reasonable. If the old MX518 and the resurrected second generation MX518 from recent release a few years ago are a testament to Logitech. I'm sure the G503 when properly maintained can be a long lasting mouse.",
          "Its a solid mouse its just a heavy boi to use in gaming and the software is pretty confusing and finicky.",
          "I\u2019ve had this mouse for about a month now and it has never disappointed me. I personally have larger hands and so a larger sized mouse like this one was perfect. I bought wireless because I live in a house where things can be easily misplaced and so having it physically connected to my pc was another level of \u201cinsurance\u201d so to speak. But that\u2019s just me, I know someone with the wireless version of this model and it works just as great. I love the fact that you can change the weight of the mouse with the included weight kit that it comes with. I personally use it in the lightest form but there is a lot of options for those that would like it a bit heavier. The added buttons are nice for gaming and overall navigation of the pc and the Logitech software used with this product is easy to work with. Also, the rgb for this mouse isn\u2019t a lot but the customization for it is pretty nice. I\u2019ve had many moments of appreciation so far when I look at my setup because this mouse really just brings it all together and makes for a really nice design. I would really really recommend getting this mouse and if you can get it in wireless as the battery life is exceptional and the burden of wires is eliminated. Overall, amazing product, I\u2019m very satisfied!",

Much faster than my old mouse and I like almost everything much more than my old MSI mouse and this one costs a third of what my old MSI mouse cost. My only real complaints are this. First and most aggravating is the mouse wheel. When I scroll with it, once I stop scrolling, it either goes too far or it goes backwards. I hate that. It has no clicks and is completely smooth rolling so you can't feel where you're supposed to stop. It's especially noticeable when I'm reading either Kindle for PC or Nook for PC because you use the mouse wheel to change pages and it will either skip ahead or go back a page every single time. My other complaint is every once in a while, when I move the mouse itself, sometimes the pointer will just randomly jump to another point on the screen. Sometimes, not even in the direction I was moving the mouse.",

          "I bought this mouse without reading many of the reviews. I searched for \"silent mouse\" and followed a trail of products until I landed on this Logitech G502 HERO mouse. I don't know if it was advertised as quiet or silent, but it doesn't matter too much at this point. The mouse is very well crafted, and the weights that are provided allow you to customize how heavy the mouse is. I didn't think this would make a big difference, but it truly does. The weight keeps the mouse parallel to the desk surface but doesn't seem to inhibit movement at all. It's a fantastic feeling. Additionally, the mouse is wired, which eliminates having to worry about batteries or latency with a wireless connection.I use this mouse for gaming and for everyday office use, but gamers who are more \"serious\" about their gaming will find all the bells and whistles needed. There are around 10 buttons on this mouse, and the software that is downloaded from the Logitech website makes setting up the functions very easy.I believe this mouse was under $40 or $50 dollars when I bought it, and it is worth every penny in my opinion.(By the way, it is not a quiet or silent mouse, but the clicks don't make much more noise than you'd expect of a high quality mouse.)",
          "Been using these for a year now and they are one of the best gaming mouses I have used I just wish they were a little bigger since I have very big hands but other then that they are amazing and have lasted all this time with out any trouble",
          "Really comfortable and accurate mouse both for gaming and general productivity. The accompanying software is very user-friendly and easy to use, allowing for a lot button customization and RGB settings. Only complaint is that the thumb button closest to the front can be really easy to press by mistake, however I turned it off for all but a few games where I actually need it so it's not much of a problem.",
          "I got this mouse for like 50% off for black friday.  Figured sure!  Let's get a nice mouse upgrade because my old Logitech mouse was starting to show defects in the left button.  I used to run the cheap G-model mouse that just has the 2 extra buttons and it was honestly FINE.  This one seemed awesome right out of the box.  It fits the hand nicely, and the extra buttons are in good spots for your fingers.  The mouse is super fast right out of the box.  Like, WAY too fast.  I had to slow down my mouse speed drastically to get back to what I am used to.  This might be a good thing for some people and I don't mind at least having the option to speed it up to ludicrous speeds if I want.  My biggest complaint is the mouse wheel.  After only playing a couple of rounds of a game, my middle finger feels like its getting calloused from the wheel.  It feels slippery, and at the same time it's rough on the finger due to the ridges on the wheel.  Actually, now that I am looking at my finger, it is peeling skin off.  I'm a chef so I do a lot of knife work.  My skin is thick for the most part so to have a mouse wheel do this to my fingers is insane.At the end of the day, I'd love this mouse if it weren't for the wheel.  I might honestly plug my shoddy old mouse back in to save my fingers until I decide to purchase another one of that model.",
          "these are one of my favorite mice, the steel series sensei is also very nice. ive bought every G502 there is, the best version which is the original, the spectrum, the hero & the lightspeed. the original isnt available any longer, but the next best one is the hero, hands down. save your money, the wireless version is garbage, the scroll wheel is a plastic light one, and the switches on all models are not great. sadly logitechs warranty is not what it was years back, but they dropped the price to $30. i can make peace with spending $30/ year (which is about as long as the G502 modern versions last)",
          "This is my second g502, I still have my original but I needed a second mouse. The newer one looks the same but it\u2019s noticeably lower quality. The woven cord is replaced with a basic bare rubber cord. The removable weights are a little too hard to get in and out, the clicking mechanism feels fragile. I\u2019m not disappointed having bought it at $40 but I\u2019m going to look for other options after this one quits working. Which I don\u2019t think will be very long",
          "I've had one of these mice for years and never had any problems with it, I just built another computer for myself and instantly knew what mouse I was going to buy. Its never let me down and I would strongly recommend it.",
          "I had the original 502 since the very day it released. This mouse is basically the same, but slightly lower quality because the lack of the braided cable. I do believe the plastic feels more rigid on this model than the first gen.",
          "Whoever thought of putting weights in a mouse please hmu I have words for you. Makes high dpi feel sooooo good and smooth.It's not a very big mouse, I'm 6'2 with longish fingers and if I use the thumb ridge there's nowhere for my pinky to rest, my theory is the tallest point of the mouse isn't tall enough for me, making it a little less than \"ergonomic\", I assume it wouldn't be an issue if your hand is smaller than mine, but it could make it difficult to use if your hand is bigger than mine, idk take my height as a reference? Good luck.No idea why it's asking about battery life cause it's a wired mouse but you do you Amazon",
          "I've never seen such a contraption before.A mouse for a computer, they say it's for gaming,But I want it to crochet, to help me keep scoring.Logitech they call it, with RGB lighting so bright,And a sensor so precise, it's the best they've ever made.It can go up to 16,000 DPI, such a sight,And with five tunable weights, it can be perfectly weighed.I reckon it can help me in my crochet work,Make my stitches more precise, and my patterns not a mess.And I heard that with this mouse, I can play Fortnite,A game where you build and shoot, sounds like a fine contest.But alas, I'm new to this mouse, and I must confess,I'm not sure how to use it, or how it can be of aid.But I'm willing to learn, and I'm sure I'll progress,With this Logitech G502 SE Hero, I won't be afraid.So let's give it a try, and see what it can do,Maybe I'll become a pro gamer, or a crochet master too!",
          "I bought this mouse to play World of Warcraft, so I can program the buttons with shortcuts.Pros:  * Programable, works with Windows 10 64 bits.  * Comes with weights, so you can make it heavier. I am using without any weights.  * Nice size, very ergonomic.  * The middle click can twist to the right or left and are programable! This gives us even more buttons.Cons:  * There are two buttons close to the scroll button, but you can only program one. The other one is to lock/unlock the wheel. Even after using this mouse for weeks, I still hit that button, which makes the scroll roll freely. I hate it.  * There are two other buttons on the left side of the right click. They are used as DPI up/DPI down. To me they are hard to reach, so I don't use them, but every now and then I hit them by accident, which changes the DPI sensitivity and mess up the game. They are programable as well, so you can just clear them.",
          "i play rainbow 6 siege and its a very competitive game and this mouse is amazing it comes with weights if you need it to be heavier and there is an extra butten for anything you need it for over all if your a gamer looking for a semi heavy mouse this is it if not go for the g502 lightspeed",
          "I\u2019ve used this mouse for a few years and I still enjoy it, it has a great feel and many customization possibilities with the software. The cable is long so if your computer is on the floor or further away from you, you are able to still use it just fine. I would recommend this mouse to anyone who needs a high quality gaming mouse.",
          "I use one of these at work and at home.  After burning through 2x razor naga trinities (primary and secondary button fatigue), I decided to give these a try.  While I miss the 7 button radial button arrangement, with this mouse, I only lost 1 button, technically.  Logitech software is easy enough to use and you don't need an account to use it, which is nice.  It's easy enough to configure all buttons the way you want them.  The scroll wheel lock and weights are by far the best features.  Best of all, it's outlived both the trinities I had.Highly recommend for business, personal, and gaming use.",
          "For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid.  You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came.  They are pretty much the same shape design.  Only a couple of differences with the hardware.  First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core.  This is hands down.  However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same.  I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'.  I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly.  I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot.  It was very comfortable for me to hold.  Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way.  Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid.  Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me.  I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years).  I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel.  The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'.  Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment.  This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches.  I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse.  Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses.  I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this.  You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes.  Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better.  I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me.  I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4.  The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me.",
          "Love the shape, features, and finally after 15+ years the software is acceptable and seemingly almost works most of the time.  Unfortunately, and probably a bit outside of directly Logitech's responsibility, is the fact that the switches are dying at a previously unheard of rate.  I've soldered just for tinker projects for years now, so no big deal, but... < $2 of parts shouldnt totally e-waste a $70+ (at the time) product.  There's a reason the latest models are all going the way of optical switches.",
          "I've been using this for months for and its been well so far. The dps on this is pretty good. I love that it is a lot easier to use than my older much cheaper mouse. Scrolling is nice. The feel and usability is great. Worth the price.",
          "Bought this mouse because my last razer one got crushed when I was moving. This mouse is not too bad, but as someone with large hands, there are some things I do not like. Firstly, it is a little small. Probably not an issue for most people. I suppose it is an average sized mouse, but for fast paced shooter games, having a small mouse with several buttons on it can be conflicting (at least for me). Secondly, the scroll wheel does not \"notch\" if that makes sense. Most mice have a notched scroll wheel, this one does not. It rolls smoothly and feels nice, but in games I never really know how far I need to scroll to get to another item or piece of equipment (you know what I mean.) It is very easy to scroll too far or not enough, so I end up just using the number line on the keyboard to switch items. It is certainly a good mouse for standard computer use, but if you have larger hands or play fast paced games that involve using the scroll wheel frequently, it may be best to look for another mouse.!!Update!!: So turns out the wheel IS notched, but there is a mechanical button on the mouse that allows the scroll wheel to become notched or free spinning. Interesting feature.",
          "The last line of the headline says it all .... nothing lasts forever. I'm pretty hard on my mice, between being online all the time, and gaming constantly as well. At some point in time, typically, one of the primary buttons usually gives up. My last G502 gave me 6yrs of rock solid performance, after which the left main mouse button started missing....and that's kind of an important button. Lottsa new mice, but none that're worth their price. This baby was dirt cheap in comparison, and battle tested ... AND software & firmware improved! Hard to beat that combo!",
          "I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.Weight and SizeThe G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available.  However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it.  In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse.  This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features.  The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn\u2019t impact my ingame performance at all.  The thumb rest is really nice, so when I\u2019m doing regular tasks that don\u2019t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters.  Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better.  I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)ProsRubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnetThe cable is built like a tank.  No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.Mouse clicks are very light and responsiveThe number of buttons makes it a productivity machineThumbrest is supportiveThe sensor is completely flawless, no odd trackingYou can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?ConsRGB is almost pointless since it\u2019s covered up by your hand.When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a \u201cspringy\u201d sound (this won\u2019t happen as long as you don\u2019t aggressively mash your buttons)The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harshWhen shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattleThe mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dustWhile the cable is sturdy, it\u2019s not flexible and is super hard and heavy.  It also gets in the way sometimes.DPI button could be shifted back littleThe optional weights are almost completely uselessPerformanceThe mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions.  The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don\u2019t break my joints pressing down on the buttons.  The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that\u2019s a problem with every mouse).  I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I\u2019ll break the mouse.  This usually isn\u2019t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.Unlike others, I didn\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d click the DPI switch buttons.  I don\u2019t think you will either, unless you\u2019re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.FINAL VERDiCTDon't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it.  For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse.  Your experience will be much better.  But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out.  Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return.",
          "I got my first Logitech G5 back in 2005ish, and then got the blue one in 2008ish, and used them for almost a decade. I also got a G500 for work. The wire eventually became unreliable and would drop connection during certain movements, so I looked for replacements. Since the G5 and G500 were discontinued, I ended up on the \"evolution...\"Enter the G502. I have been using the same one, for my main PC for about 8 years. Still no problems, but with the string of great deals on the G502 Hero I decided to replace it and move it to my work at home setup, since no matter how hard I wished for the, the MX518 doesn't feel like the G5/G5xxs... Especially since it lacks the free spinning scroll wheel, one of my favorite features.",
          "There's tons of features that are super helpful when it comes to playing games and very convenient when doing more mundane task (like school and work tasks). I will say that sometimes the extra buttons are a bit much when doing school and work tasks and it's definitely for gaming but after a bit of use, I've gotten used to it but there was a slight curve.",
          "The build quality is nice, there are enough extra buttons that I don't know what to do with them all, the ability to reprogram and create macros for each button is also very nice, but the mouse is a little heavy and may be too big for some people. There's also the logo and the DPI indicators that are RGB and customizable, so there's that. The sensor is also really good, fast and accurate and able to go all the way up to 25000 DPI which is absolutely insane.Overall, great mouse and I can see why people covet it so much and why it will go down in the history books of computer mice.",
          "The Logitech G502 HERO is a top-of-the-line gaming mouse that delivers precision, speed, and accuracy. Its HERO 25K sensor ensures that every movement is captured with pinpoint accuracy, and the 25,600 DPI allows for lightning-fast response times. The ergonomic design and adjustable weights make it comfortable to use for long periods of time, and the customizable buttons give you full control over your gaming experience.The Logitech G502 HERO is an excellent choice for gamers who demand the best performance from their equipment. Its sleek design and high-quality construction make it a pleasure to use, and its advanced sensor technology ensures that you'll be able to keep up with even the most intense gaming sessions.

          "I love this mouse, gave only 4 stars because the first one I got the indicator lights broke in less than a day. The red and blue were broken, only the green was working. I chose settings where it was supposed to be flashing rainbow in sync with the logo light. The logo went full rainbow and the indicator would only light up when it came around to green. Returned that one and got a second mouse which seems to be fine. Maybe it was just bad luck, but just incase. 4 stars. Sorry!",
          "I had purchased a G502 from another site about six years ago, saw this particular G502 Model for a great price around the beginning of December 2022, $29.99 U.S., and decided to replace a Logitech G502 mouse that had seen some better days.What I like:-Sits on the G502 footprint and has the same layout as the G502 it replaced in my inventory;-Higher DPI than the original, which is about the largest upgrade on this mouse; and-Feels good in larger hands, such as my own.What I don't like:-The adjustable DPI button used to momentarily drop the DPI while being depressed, is in a pretty terrible spot on both the original G502, and this model, as well.  My thumb is a little too short to reach it, without needing to reposition my hand;-The USB cable is not braided nylon like the original G502; and-For left-handed users, this mouse is pretty much a no-go, as it seems that the mouse is best suited to right-handed users, such as myself, based on the curvature of the mouse.Overall, the G502 Hero keeps the best of the G502, improves on the DPI a bit, but still leaves something to be desired in its design.",
          "I had gotten my original one as a gift years ago, and I just replaced it because the click-and-drag was dropping sometimes and the feet were starting to catch my mousepad. It's still the same great mouse, but it doesn't have a braided cable this time (just rubber, which is fine, just not as nice) and it didn't come with the weights. I personally don't use the weights anyway, but I thought people should know.",
          "There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc. - Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better! - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!*** Update ***The mouse is durable  and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself.",
          "Overall, I really do like this mouse.  The weight is great without adding anything to it, but it is there if you want to add more weight to it.  It's not the lightest mouse available, but it is still pretty light.  It is very ergonomic and comfortable when playing and the buttons are all really easy to get to.  It fits my hands pretty nicely.  I will say that if you don't use the mouse wheel button to make it \"click,\" it spins so freely (like a fidget spinner) that in any game that uses the mouse wheel you are going to have problems.  An example of this is shooters that use it to switch weapons you are going to constantly do this without even touching the mouse wheel.",
          "I love this mouse!  I have been using this model for years!  Every time I get a new computer, I get a new one of this model of mouse to use with it.  I ordered 3 recently when I saw the price had dropped and I will use one of them on my new gaming computer that is being delivered to me soon.  This mouse is very durable to me.  I have only had once where the bottom plastic part came off when I was vigorously gaming but it snapped back on easily and I continued gaming.  I see that they have the new highly rated wireless model now, but I prefer a wired mouse, so this been the one for me and I have been totally satisfied with it.",
          "My first gaming mouse and the only one I\u2019ll ever use. Never swapping!",
          "This is now the third of this model I have bought. They work well and I have them at home work and for travel.",
          "So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly.",
          "I bought this mouse in 2019 and it now starting to act up, the right click stops working or when I hold it down it will release still. The only way to fix the issue I blow into it then it works for a few mins then acts up. I guess it is time to buy a new mouse. It is a VERY good mouse I love the macro and programing for it and the free scroll wheel or normal scroll.",
          "Went from a fully ergonomic mouse with a crappy sensor to this mouse, and oh my goodness it is so much better! My wrist never gets sore, which is saying something because I will game for up to 14 hours continuously. The sensor is fantastic, I am actually able to play competitively compared to my old mouse. It has never stopped working, or malfunctioned in any way. The software is fantastic too!",
          "I'm sure everyone wants to hear the improvements the would need above all else and then it's great qualities along with any bad ones, so here are the things you may or may not like to hear from someone who has been using this mouse for nearly a year.1st, there's only 1 problem i've ever come across with this mouse and it's the common problem that hits every electronic there is out there in the world so it's completely understand able.it's the ending part of the cord that plugs into the device/computer you use. if that bends too much over time it can damage the wire. my only suggest is having the warranty.Besides it's 1 common downfall inn all electronics this mouse has served me well and i love the weight as it makes my control more accurate and precise in gaming.along with the extra buttons but not too many buttons, just enough that you can bind the important keys to it and use them makes it all the better.pros: The entire product. and it's pretty cheap as of currently compared to other mouse's.cons: a common issue among electronics that just can't really be fixed.suggestions: Make sure to get the warranty!Thank you for this mouse that's very helpful!",
          "Hello,I own several Logitech devices.  They are:Gamepad/Controller:  F710 and F310Camera:  C910Headset:  G933Keyboard:  G105Mouse: G502 HeroThe Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151.  The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:1) The mouse2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it.  They are: 2A)  A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer. 2B)  A computer with a URL:  logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO 2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.) 2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.3) A black 6 sided box.When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products.  From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).I decided to contact Logitech support.  First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model.  When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice.  Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list.  The \"Logitech Assistant\" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse.  It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO.  This never ends.  It won't let me talk to an agent until I.  Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant.  (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it.  I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)In the end, I decide to call Logitech.  The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person.  She want to help me. Outstanding!  She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc.  Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:1) The G502-HERO manual.  I've yet to read it.2) The G-Hub manual.3) The G502-HERO downloads.4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset.  It doesn't recognize the mouse.She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.I comply downloading and then starting the installation process.  It wants to restart the system.  OK, I restart the computer.  After logging back into Windows, nothing happens.  The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151.  Ah!  Why did I have to restart?  What was the purpose of the restart.  Nothing looks different, so why the restart?The Logitech support person says to start the installer again.  It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue.  WHAT THE F*******?Honestly:** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations.  Why?  She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it.  This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller.  She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices.  I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling.  (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).)  I use the headset with Discord, games, etc.  I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff.  Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet.  All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse.  I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button.  Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.Bottom line:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people. ***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products). ***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub. ***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?I will update this review should Logitech get back to me.  I'll gladly let you know how it goes.UPDATE 1:  I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues.  The mouse is running in default mode.  I have seen two hardware issues.1)  I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub.  I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great!  It moved and the G was lit.The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen.  The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen.  Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub.  Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs.  I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).Again the bottom line hasn't changed:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.Final update:  Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35!  I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working.  Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105.  The answer is yet another piece of software to run.Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)?  Aren't customers returning worth it?",
          "Mouse works flawlessly. The ergonomic feel is great really fits in shape of your hand an just feels good! Got this for my gf\u2019s new setup an she loves it! Def worth it! iMergeGaming approves!",
          "llego en perfectas condiciones.el mouse es un poco pesado (lo uso sin las barras metalicas ) sin embargo su resistencia al rozamiento es casi imperceptible, se desliza facilmente lo que da una sensacion de que este mouse fue fabricado para fijarse a la base y ser dificil de alzar pero facil de desplazar,el menu g pro tiene muchas funciones para cambiarle (recomiendo activar la iluminacion del dpi, en mi caso pense que estaba averiado el rgb porque no lo active) sin embargo , no tiene sincronizacion con icue ,tengo un teclado corsair y el menu icue no detecta el dispositivo (a tener en cuenta si deseas que todo tu setup tenga el mismo patron en el rgb)he averiguado que dicen que si se sincroniza con aura sync(ASUS) pero habra de probar.",
          "I absolutely loved this mouse, works effortlessly for gaming. I upgraded from the plain G205 to this. Somehow I missed that they did not cover the cord like the old one...That is a very important thing to me as my mice need the cords covered. Welp, my cat ate it in the first 2 weeks. So other then them not having the cord covered like the other ones, its quite nice. Ill have to look for another with the covered cord so I dont have to be disappointed again."

          "I have had those little mice that are like $20 that you can find at any store before from Logitech and they have been OK and have served their purpose but when I came to gaming mice I always used wired mice specifically those from corsair. Getting this mouse has made my experience using my PC in both gaming and non-gaming applications significantly better.This mouse is extremely lightweight, holds a charge all day, and has durable sensors from my experience.It might be just a Windows 10 thing but I have noticed that if I turn off my computer and turn off my mouse at the end of the night windows will sometimes awake from sleep. My strategy to mitigate this has been to plug in the mouse, then tell my PC to go into sleep mode, and then while it is going into sleep mode I flip the mouse over and turn it off. Doing this has led to my computer not a waking from sleep in the middle of the night as it has done previously with other mice and my mouse is still able to charge.I charge this mouse every night when I go to sleep and I use the mouse pretty much from 8 AM to 10 PM most days of the week with maybe an hour in that timeframe where I am idle. It has never died on me during use.One drawback that I would say this mouse does have however are the stock feet which are not bad but I would recommend upgrading as you can get a decent pair of aftermarket feet for $20 or so with a noticeable difference in smoothness.Another one and probably the most problematic for all users who care about looks is the finish of the mouse. The mouse has a somewhat map finish which looks great until you touch it. The area where my thumb and pointer finger rest are permanently shiny. I realize that this mouse is made out of ABS plastic which is prone to shining overtime but these areas of my mouse shined faster than the ABS key caps that I use. It\u2019s not that I ate some greasy food or anything just the oils in my hands have caused this thing to shine, despite trying to clean it after I observed the initial shining taking place. Personally, I don\u2019t care that much about it as my hand is normally on top of it anyways but some people may be concerned with that.Those are really the only two complaints I have about this mouse and the pros vastly outweigh the cons. I purchased this mouse for around US$100 so if you can get it for that or less I would say it is worth the money.",

          "I have to say, this is THE best wireless mouse I have ever owned, and I have owned a few (logitech of old, mamba, etc).I set it up today, with only half battery life (54%), and have been online web-browsing multiple sites for a long while, as well as playing 3 games (Yakuza 0, Vermintide 2, Overkill's the walking dead beta) for about 3 and a  half hours, and the battery only went down to 52%, in what, maybe 5 hours I have had it installed? I dont think they are exagerating that 64 hour battery life at all (I AM using it w/o the RGB lighting, as the Logitech app said it would cut my time down from 64 hours to 50-52 hours, and I would rather have the extra 12 hours game time than have some light underneath my palm where I cant see it).The mouse is big (I have large hands), but not as big as the steelseries rival (original) is. That is what I am moving on from, the original steelseries rival. Compared to that, it is 'almost' as long as the rival, and as high as the rival in the center, but I wish it was bigger in the rear end side, as it is a little thin at the back for my taste, which means I have to move it more than I would like to, and I 'feel' it under my palm. It is by no means a deal breaker though, as I have been using it for  only 5 hours and it already feels VERY natural to me. I can hardly tell I am using a new mouse, except for that thin-ness at the rear.The mouse is VERY lightweight. So, if you people that like a heavy mouse, or like adding weights into a mouse, you are out of lick with this mouse. You 'may' be able to add weights in the rear compartment, meant for storing the cable, but other than that, I think you are out of luck. But, dont discount it because of the weight. My rival mouse was a lot heavier, and I thought I was not going to like this logitech mouse because it IS so lightweight, but I was wrong. I dont mind the weight, and I actually am lifting the mouse a lot less than I used to lift my rival mouse. Heh.The wireless thing is NOT a joke! It truly is just as good as my preferred wired mouse, and its ten times better than any other wireless mouse I have ever used, easily better. It is also just as good hit-scan wise as THE best, most accurate mouse I have ever used, the Logitech G100S. And, that is WITH being wireless!If you have the money, dont even think about it, just buy the mouse. I was thinking this would be another return mouse, and I would have to use one of my backup mice instead, like my zowie 1k. But nope, this mouse is not going back. It will be my primary mouse until it dies (which hopefully wont be until an even better version of this mouse is out). I dont know how they could improve on the mouse, unless they make the battery life even longer, or make it more precise than it already is, except to make it a tiny bit fatter in the rear of the mouse, for people who use a true  palm grip, and they make it JUST a palm grip mouse instead of both claw and palm grips. But, that is my opinion, others like claw grips better, and I think this would work well for anyone who uses claw grip also, just becasue of that slim rear end.I cant say enough good things about this mouse to actually make you buy it, but trust me, this IS the mouse you always wanted, have been waiting for forever to cut the cord, and it is right here, right now, available to everyone. No gimmick, just pure kick butt mouse.",
          "I previously owned two G602 and they both died within a year: one with left button multiple clicks when only pressed once, the other had a malfunction scroll wheel.So I'm very pleased to see the G Pro survived more than a year in my hand in ALMOST perfect condition.After a year of daily driving this mouse, the scroll wheel start to feel unresponsive and make a strange notice while all other buttons works perfectly fine.Definitely a better build quality than the G 603 but I wish the scrolling wheel is more durable.",
          "Had a 59 gram wired mouse before this and thought this would weight too much but it seems exactly the same but better.",
          "For a limited edition mouse, I would say i got it at the best price considering it had a 52 percent off deal. ive been using it for about 2 weeks now and its great. One of the best mice if not the best mice ive ever used",
          "I love wireless mouses but the response time aren\u2019t as good as wired mouse but with this one the response time is good",
          "\u00a0The mouse is extremely comfortable. Its quite light weight, at least light enough for me. Despite it being long, it doesn't feel too big, and the side buttons are easy to click. Pretty too.I used this mouse to pvp in Albion online, Valorant and Fortnite.",
          "I bought this blue and gold abomination only because it was less than half the price of the normal black G Pro Wireless, no doubt due to it being about as visually appealing as a bowel movement.Setting aside its unfortunate looks, this mouse works every bit as well as any other G Pro Wireless, so, if you want a good deal on one and don't mind what it looks like, get this one.",
          "*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.That is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \"break-in\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.It's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \"tell\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.----Old Review----I honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \"hand feel\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.The problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.Now, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.However, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.So what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \"glide\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.I have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.I'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review.",
          "Worked like G305, G703 etc.Open the box, and the USB dongle was not in the mice! but it was in the tiny box in the mice box. weird.The mice has a auto sleep feature that can't be turned off!?  There is a wake up delay due to that, which is really annoying.  Didn't have any of that with any other wireless mice I've had before.Figure out the delay issue, the problem is the Logitech software, as soon as I transfers the software profile to the onboard mouse, the issue disappeared. Never had this stupid issue before, had to do a lot of research to get it fixed.",

          "This mouse is amazing definitely recommend for gaming",
          "I'm broke and have been using the same old mouse for years, but I think this is worth the price considering it was 50 percent off. I prefer the color of the black version though. Battery life lasts for weeks but I can just charge it for an hour when I'm not playing. I think it's perfectly fine since it doesn't need replaceable batteries.",
          "Gaming mouses last around a year before they go bad on me but they mouse I bought on a sale and its so good. Easy install and charging port when batteries are low. Light weight and feels good to the tough. Plus the League of Legend design!",
          "Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.*Packaging*For a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.*Opening*So once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle  but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.*Package Contents*The package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.*The Mouse*The mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.*Installation*So the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware  no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.*The feels*So I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.*Tracking*So this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.*Conclusion*I was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.",

          "Started using this mouse in early September 2021. I had been on a mouse buying spree to try to find a wireless model that felt good. Upon using this one it immediately became my favorite because of its light weight, responsiveness, long battery life, and the ability to use it left- or right-handed.I'm at a computer all day for work and also play a lot of PC games, so daily use of this mouse averaged 8+ hours. I was used to heavier mice and the G Pro Wireless was much more comfortable for my hands and wrists for long periods of time.Last week (January 2023) the mouse started registering random double clicks of the \"back\" side button on the left side, and at about the same time the scroll wheel occasionally scrolls the screen in the opposite direction of my input. I've tried the mouse on two different computers to check if my PC was causing the problem, but the issue was the same on other machines.I'm outside the warranty range and will probably need to switch to a different mouse. The G Pro Wireless is a 5/5 in quality for the 16 months that it lasted, but I feel a $90 mouse should last longer than that.",
          "This mouse is affordable because of the League of Legends branding. Thanks for the vendor making it on sell. It turns out the mouse feels  ergonomic. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best compare to the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, but it\u2019s up there.",
          "I recently purchased the Logitech G Pro Wireless mouse, and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed. This is hands-down the best wireless gaming mouse I have ever used.First off, the design is sleek and ergonomic, fitting comfortably in my hand for extended gaming sessions. The buttons are easily accessible and have a satisfying click when pressed. The weight is perfectly balanced, making it feel like an extension of my hand rather than a clunky accessory.But what really sets this mouse apart is its responsiveness. I play a lot of fast-paced games that require quick movements and precise aim, and this mouse delivers on both fronts. The HERO 25K sensor provides incredibly accurate tracking, and the Lightspeed wireless technology ensures that there is no lag or latency whatsoever.Another huge plus is the battery life. I can go weeks without needing to recharge, and when I do, it only takes a few hours to get back to a full charge. Plus, the Logitech G HUB software allows me to customize the mouse's settings to my liking, including DPI levels, button mapping, and RGB lighting.Overall, I cannot recommend the Logitech G Pro Wireless mouse enough. It's the perfect combination of style, comfort, and performance, and has quickly become my go-to gaming mouse. If you're in the market for a new wireless gaming mouse, this one should definitely be at the top of your list.",
          "Great mouse but the battery life could be better. Lasts about a week with normal use.",
          "Despite its simple looks it\u2019s actually really awesome. I love the lightweight feel and it\u2019s super comfortable to hold. I am super bad about charging it however I barely ever have to.",
          "1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.Overall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless.  The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech.",
          "I Bought This While it was on sale for 40 dollars and for that price i can recommend this but not for full price here's why. I'm Not sure if it is my pc or the mouse dongle or maybe the mouse itself but it almost feels like it has mouse acceleration/smoothing on and i couldn't personally figure out how to change it if there was any to begin with. for that reason i give it 4 stars but if its on sale for 40 grab this mouse ITS WORTH IT definitely better that my 10$ cheapo mouse.",
          "Mouse is super light and very responsive",
          "It's cheaper than the normal g pro wireless. I prefer this color way, even though I don't play league I don't really mind it. Battery lasts very long. 10/10 purchase.",
          "Overall:Feels like a pretty solid mouse.  I am left-handed and have been having good luck using ambidextrous mice with both sets of side buttons.Likes:- Battery life, so far I have been using it part time for the past two days and I am only down to 90%- Connection, no glitchy connection issues- Magnetic side buttons, these were super easy to swap out for left-handersDislikes:- Surface, it feels just a bit too slick.  I use a fingertip grip and I wish it was slightly grippy or rubbery- Battery indicator, maybe a flush button just under the DPI lights that you could show you battery life.  Currently, I believe, you have to pull up the software and device to see itSeems like a solid mouse with good connection, wakes up quickly and has a good battery life so far.  I only wish it wasn't as slippery and had a way to instantly see battery life on the device.",
          "I bought this mouse on total impulse after seeing one of my favorite Overwatch players get a custom team-colored G Pro Wireless. I figured that if I couldn't have the awesome light blue one I saw in his picture, I should get the next best thing!UNBOXING:This thing is clean. It's packaged professionally but not in a gimmicky way telling you about how it's the best gaming mouse around. It also comes with minimal accessories, but all those necessary to make your gaming experience better with this mouse. It has 4 extra buttons to replace side buttons that you can program individually through their software, and as stated in their product description, you can totally switch these to the other side if you're left handed! Also comes with a charging cord which is sturdy, but flexible and long enough for any normal pc setup.FIRST REACTION:Plugging this thing in and charging it was a breeze. I didn't time it, but I'm guessing it took around 30 minutes to hit full-charge on what's supposed to be a 30+ hour battery life. Not too bad. Along with that, the software you need to control the lighting on it as well as customizing your dpi settings is SO EASY! Razer may have nice peripherals as well, but we can all say that their synapse and cortex softwares are hot garbage. Logitech hit the nail on the head with this software. It took nearly no time for me to set my dpi to 400, get the lighting pattern just right, and jump into my games. Also quite smooth, I like the way it glides on my mouse pad, and it feels nicer on the cloth mouse pad than my new Razer Mamba Elite and Corsair M65 PRO.FIRST FEW HOURS:Man I love this thing. I have large hands and had doubts about longer gaming sessions having to use a slightly tighter grip on this mouse, but those doubts were thrown out the window after a 6 hour session today playing Overwatch. The mouse is on the lighter side, and that's a big step for me considering I used the Corsair M65 for a while, and I decided that heavier mouses were my favorite, but man this thing just feels so great. It feels just as ergonomically sound as my Razer Mamba Elite, and the clicks feel more responsive. Along with all of that, I checked my battery charge after this gaming session, and it was at a solid 95% (I'm sure it'd be lower if I set up alternating color patterns and whatnot, but I just have a static color running right now).PROS:- Lightweight (depends on if you like lightweight mice)- Battery life is as advertised- Shape is form-fitting even to larger hands- Buttons feel sturdy and responsive- NO CORD! (sorry to my newly retired mouse bungee)- Response time in-game feels great. 1ms seems about right, but haven't done any real tests for it yetCONS:- lightweight (again depending on whether or not that's your thing)- not as customizable as say a Razer mouse with addressable lighting zones- I've read that it is difficult to switch the side buttons, but it's doable nonethelessWill definitely be buying another one as a backup and any special editions that come out!",
          "it\u2019s sooooo light and has really smooth movements, perfect for gaming (:",
          "So lets get this out of the way, why not 5 stars.  The only reason I'm not giving this mouse 5 stars is because the profile/settings are not stored on the hardware itself.  Logitech software must be running for RGB profile as well as resolution setting.  The mouse has a default RGB setting and DPI.  This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe that is the reason?  My previous wired mice Razer and Corsair brand seemed to keep their profile.Charging:I don't have the charging mat to go with this mouse, but I don't find it a hassle to charge.  Pretty convenient using the cable they provide which the USB dongle can attach to.  I try to swap them out once a week just to make sure it always has a charge.Hand-feel:I have fairly large hands (6'2\" is my height), the size was a little concerning for me as I've always purchased large mice.  I like it though, it weighs next to nothing, especially compared to the last few mice I've used.  The only other minor gripe I have with this mouse is that I tend to have my pinky on the ground when I play.  There are times when I flick right (I'm right handed) and the fat on my pinky goes under the mouse bringing up the right edge of the mouse off the table.  The mouse basically must have full contact to operate and I have noticed at times, not just flicking, but panic tracking, that the mouse is non-responsive because it is just a few MMs off the table.  I've been trying to adjust how I hold the mouse which always alleviates the issue, and I could probably benefit from better mouse-posture anyway, so I can't really consider this in my star-rating.Software:IMO Razer has the absolute best software for my needs.  The Logitech software seems good, I'll need more time and play more variety of games to really see if it checks all the boxes for me though.  I've been fairly casual since I got this mouse, Ark Survival Evolved, Rust, Icarus, Among Us, pretty much all things that only require default functionality, no MMO play yet.Random thoughts:What happened to the day when we'd add weights to our mice?  I think part of it is the popularity of quick-action shooters such as Valorant.  You can't flick with a boulder. I purchased this mouse because I really like the game Rust, a popular Rust streamer, spoonkid, plugged this mouse during one of his streams and I wanted to check it out.  I tell you what, I went from a rock on the beach to AK in half the time with this mouse.  j/k I still suck at Rust, but that's on me.",
          "Afteer 3 pa2irs of pro wireless they all double clicked early into their life, i want to say no more then a month into having them, last one i had fixed itself, the logitech ghub is a buggy mess, you never know what your true battery life is, and every time you plug it in you have different readings.

          "After just about a little over a month of use this mouse is feeling far better than any of those I\u2019ve previously owned. The battery life is surprisingly great for that of a Bluetooth mouse and I really couldn\u2019t miss the drag that comes with wired mouses. overall great product, a bit pricey for a casual gamer but definitely worth the price!",
          "Shape was amazing, and the color design is good too, I dont play LoL but i bought it since it was discounted. Very good mouse that is pretty lightweight, but I would have rather gotten the superlight as it is a better mouse in my opinion, but other than that, amazing mouse.",
          "Wonderful",
          "I bought the Logitech G Pro Wireless to be my new laptop mouse and I like it a lot more than I expected. To the point I am making excuses to use it on my Desktop, while its new and shiny. Instead of my G502 X Plus, which will stay my main mouse. This is a fantastic mouse, especially at the less than $100 price point. Would I like the Superlight as much or better? Probably, yes. Is it worth the extra $40-$70? Not to me, considering the Superlight doesn't have USB C either, which would be my main reason to consider it. This mouse's strength is its (now medium) weight, simplicity, and ambidexterity.PROS:- Ambidextrous yet very comfortable shape- Button options to make it fully functional as a left-handed mouse, if that's your thing- Normal Logitech Powerplay compatibility, Lightspeed connection, and 25K Hero sensor- On board dongle storage- Good size and weight for traveling without being too small for my handsCONS:- No Bluetooth connection option- Smooth plastic texture on sides make mouse slippery when my hands are dry- Micro USB",
          "Love these new Logitech mouses",
          "If you have ANY hair on your mousepad, it will get stuck in the laser sensor, which will cause your mouse to glitch around. You need some tweezers to pick em off the sensor, just don't scratch it... Kinda disappointing in this sense.In addition, the Logitec program that you install to control the mouse kind of sucks, because when you plug the mouse in to charge, you gotta restart the logitec program, because if you don't, the mouse will glitch around sometimes and not move for a second.",
          "So far it's a great mouse with good battery life. Definitely don't miss the freaking cable on my old mouse. I bought it on sale because the decal design I guess but who cares. I play CSGO and it works flawlessly.",
          "Color:The color is a lot lighter and less saturated than showed in the pictures, which is disappointing.Buttons:The buttons are very responsive and give a great clicking feedback.Form Factor:The form factor is great because it\u2019s ambidextrous, especially with the ability to change which side the side buttons are.",
          "I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.The build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.Logitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down.",
          "I've had razer mice since always. Finally, I decided to try something different and I feel like I made a great choice. Very comfortable, aesthetic, and convenient. If you want a good mouse get this one, it won't be a bad decision."

My cheap Chinese mouse has been running great for almost 5 years now yet a branded and expensive product like Logitech Mx Master 2S has stopped working in just an year. Since it\u2019s more than an year, no warranty either. Logitech rejected my repair request saying I am out of warranty. I see a lot of good reviews but my experience is disappointing. It would be a gamble if you buy this mouse in terms of quality as per my experience. Good luck !Update 12/2022I reached out to the customer service and they resolved the issue by sending me a replacement. So even though the initial product had issues, I am increasing the stars for the good customer service and their willingness to address and resolve the issue in customer\u2019s favor.",
          "At first I was skeptical if the ergonomics would help my hand. I like to rest my arm on the table and move the mouse with my wrist. This mouse is very comfortable and the shape molds with the natural resting position of my hand. I like the function buttons too. My favorite is the side scroll. I work through Excel documents quite often and the side scroll function makes my lift so much more convenient when navigating! Only downside is that the Logitech software seems to lose connection causing me to lose my assigned function keys. I would have to relaunch the logitech application for my function keys to enable again which is a little annoying. Other than that, great mouse!",

The battery life on this thing is insane, especially with how much use I put into it.The only criticisms I could give are that I wish it had a couple more buttons on the side and I wish the clicks were just a little quieter.Came brand new in box with no defects.

The only complaint I have is its reliance on software for features such as the DPI, mouse wheel auto infinity scroll and other customizations. Otherwise, it's very comfortable to hold and use and the wireless performance of the device is great so far. Highly recommended if you're looking for a great home or work mouse and don't plan to do heavy gaming with it.FULL REVIEWI've eyed up the MX Master series of mice from Logitech for quite a while now but I found that the price point was always a bit too high for my liking. Paying $80 for it was still a hard pill to swallow at first but I'm glad I decided to purchase this mouse. I purchased it so that I could experience it first hand and form my own opinion after seeing a bunch of praise from several Tech YouTubers. I can see why people really like this mouse.It is very comfortable to use and is very feature rich. It has just the right amount of buttons with the ability to perform additional actions via Gestures. The button clicks are satisfying and the scrolling action is also satisfying. I like the fact that it has a mechanism built in that \"releases\" the scroll wheel to do infinite scrolling if you wheel it fast and clamps back down to do notched scrolling if you are slowly scrolling. They also provide a hardware button just like on their other mice to allow infinite scrolling to be constantly on. I also enjoy the side scroll wheel. I used the left and right \"middle click\" on my G502 to navigate spreadsheets a lot and this wheel makes doing that a lot easier.The overall experience with this mouse is a pleasing one. I got up and running with it quickly and have come to like it's additional features over the past few days I've been using it. The price is still a bit hard to swallow but it is a \"premium\" mouse and that means it comes in at a \"premium\" price. I never utilized the \"flow\" software so I can't comment on that but I'm sure it's nice to have for the right person. If you can afford it and if you're looking for a great home/work mouse not really meant for heavy gaming, this one definitely has my recommendation.",
          "Amazingly ergonomic and supportive for long work sessions, can connect in any way you'd think of, and has great battery life. The perfect mouse.",
          "So comfortable and works very well",
          "The Mouse came promptly and works great but there was NO Unifying Receiver (USB) included as noted in the ads or as shown in all the product pictures. Fortunately I have used Logitech enough that I have other USB Unifying Receivers to use. But for a brand new customer to Logitech - you are going to be toast! Back packaging or just a dupe of the advertisements? Don't know.",
          "Charged it up and connected it to two laptops with Bluetooth.  I can switch anytime I need too!",
          "Scope: I am comparing this mouse to its previous model (MX Master) and the G602 gaming mouse. I used each of those for many years and would rate both of them 5 out of 5 for their feature set at the time.Purpose: I got this mouse primarily to add the Logitech Options/Flow feature to my multiple box/monitor setup. Basically, Flow lets you use the same mouse/keyboard for multiple computers/monitors. This feature works as intended, and I love not having to move my hands from one keyboard/mouse to another one.Pros: The durability of the mouse seems just as strong as previous Logitech mice I've used, and feels strong and solid. The materials are good, with a rubberized grip on the thumb, but not the rubberized grip on the palm that the G602 has. Battery life I cannot fully review yet as I have not had this mouse long enough, but so far it hasn't moved from the original out-of-box half-charge after about a week of significant use (8+ hours per day).Con 1: Where this model mainly falls short is in the overall feel. It feels taller and fatter than both the MX Master and G602. My hand has to stay both more open and further back to hold it when compared to smaller mice, and i prefer to have my hand further forward in a more 'claw-like' grip. I have played piano and guitar most of my life and one of the important points to consider ergonomically when pressing down on a key or fret or in this case, a mouse button, is to have an over-the-top down-press that comes from curving your fingers. That grip allows more strength, response, and precision. This mouse positions your hand in a way where your fingers have a flattened down-press. Think of it this way: for improved fatigue, response time, and control, you want to be pressing with the tips of your fingers, not the pads of them -- and this mouse forces you to down-press with the pads. If you do not have neatly trimmed nails, then this mouse is for you, but if you prefer function/fatigue/control over your appearance, it's not as good.Con 2: Perhaps less importantly, but certainly noticeable, is the click travel and sound on this mouse. The clicks are LOUD and the travel distance of the mouse is further than on previous models. The G602 is much quieter and has a shorter travel distance, and for that reason I prefer the G602.Overall: I will continue using this mouse and hopefully get used to the more open feel, and will update my review if anything changes. My take-away from using it thus far is this: The perfect mouse for me would be the G602 upgraded to be compatible with Logitech Flow and perhaps with an increased polling rate. With the numerous programmable buttons in logically placed locations, the shorter height and better overall feel, and the quieter/shallower clicks, the G602 was a superior mouse. I have also tried the newer 'gaming' mice by Logitech (primarily G700S) and they are comparable in feel albeit not as controllable as the G602.Advice: If you have long nails or a very large hand, this mouse will be great for you. If you have an average/small sized hand and/or trimmed nails, skip this one and instead look into a 'gaming' mouse for the improved ergonomics.",
          "After reading a multitude of reviews and a dozen or so YouTube videos, I decided to pull the plug on the new MX 3.  The MX Keyboard is a staple in my Mac based studio where my private world revolves around graphic art, writing, and music composition, and my professional world around software engineering.  I spend 90% of my day with my hands on some form of controller.  I have enjoyed many Logitech devices over the years but this is my first foray into their higher end devices preferring Apple's magic trackpads in the past.To begin with, all the reviews are spot on concerning the MX 3, it is an amazing device.. however, the ergonomics did not fit my Medium hands.  As a pianist and guitarist my hands have an abnormal amount of reach compared to many but my index finger could not fully reach, cover, or comfortably operate the MX3 main scrolling wheel.Yes, the MX3's all steel wheel and magnetic feedback are better than the 2S, but aside from the heftier weight, I preferred the position of the main scrolling wheel as well as all the buttons on the 2S including the placement and composition of the thumb scroll.  I chose to disengage the ratcheting feedback on the 2S and personally love it.Ergonomically the 2S is far better for my particular hands.  The 2S is slightly shorter in height and slightly wider in width.  My farthest right 2 fingers have more to rest and hold onto compared to the MX3, and strangely I also found the bottom left button and left buttons alongside the horizontal thumb scroll wheel were better placed for my needs.Although this review is as much about the MX3 as for the 2S, I had a hard time finding many reviews covering both.  Hope this helps someone.I also purchased the new Anywhere 3 and also love it.. in fact I may find that I actually prefer it, time will tell :D.",
          "I'm currently using it with a laptop, but may order more to replace my old mice on two workstations.",
          "Works with other Unifying receiver products, rechargable and works on different surfaces. Grooves and curves for your hand.",
          "After about a year the button used to easy display other open screens stops working. Is the button that you click with your thumb pressing down. Was a great feature for the time I was able to use it but a big disappointment now that not only stopped working on one but on both. I wouldn't buy the same model again.",
          "Love the feel of this mouse. High quality materials. The vertical scroll wheel is great and I love the two setting for it. Th horizontal wheel is sometimes delayed. Back buttons take some getting used to.",
          "This mouse is very dependable mouse that does not seem to wear out. I have had the original MX for at 10 years and it is as good now for 'clicking' as on the day I bought it. Very precise tracking, very comfortable in the hand.",
          "Occasionally I will buy a more expensive item for my computer just to see if the increased cost is worth it or not. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not. When I had gotten a new laptop I wanted to get a new mouse with it, and the only features I was really looking for were bluetooth, and the ability to use it on basically any surface. I have had this for nearly a year as of posting this review.So. What did I end up getting? For starters, I did test the mouse on all kinds of weird surfaces, such as glass, my hand, or my computer monitors, and it worked pretty smoothly on every surface I tested. So it nails that. The bluetooth works amazingly well as well, and the battery life is incredible - requiring charged only after weeks of use.I have had problems with wireless mice having a delay on initial movement, which sounds like a minor problem until you are experiencing it. No delay with this mouse. It is very responsive.The mouse wheel was a nice surprise. It has some special thought put into it. It has the ability to roll like most wheels do, the ability to free spin, and a button to toggle these modes. What it also has is the ability to do a hybrid of these where, if you spin it with a low amount of force it spins normally, but if you spin it harder it toggles to free spin. If you install the mouse's software, you can configure how much force it takes to smoothly transition into the free spin, or to effectively disable that feature.On the side of the mouse is a scroll wheel that controls side to side movement in the way the scroll wheel handles up and down. Very useful for applications like spreadsheets where sideways scrolling is a thing.The mouse has a number of buttons on it that can be configured in the software. One of those buttons is actually underneath where your thumb rests, and is resistant enough to prevent accidental presses, and not so resistant that it is a pain to use. One of the things you can configure in the software is what that button does when you hold it and move the mouse. Holding it and swiping the mouse down might minimize everything on your screen, while an up or sideways motion, or a direct tap is configured to do something else.Neat feature set, right? Well that isn't even all it can do. It has another feature in which you can connect it to multiple computers, and then you and move the mouse around between them like they are all multiple monitors. You can also move files between the computers this way. The feature is a bit on the slow side, needing time to disconnect from one computer and connect to the other when switching, which isn't as smooth as you might hope. However, it is still a very useful feature if you have multiple systems and often move files between them. Great quality of life feature!Overall, this mouse far exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting to say that this mouse is worth every penny of its fairly high cost, but that is what I am saying. Yes, it is a bit costly for a mouse, but it is very, very worth it.",
          "Ordered this mouse a while ago and it worked great for a couple months until it started failing on me. More on that below. First let's look at the pros and cons of this mouse.PROS:- Good design: Looks great on the desk and it is very comfortable.- Plenty of buttons and features.- App for Windows and Mac to tweak all the settings.- Bluetooth AND USB receiver option.- Battery life is great lasting for months a time with just one charge.- The infinite scroll wheel feature and the thumb/horizontal scroll wheel are fantastic features to have in a mouse. Many uses like video editing (timeline horizontal scrolling), long and wide spreadsheets, brush size adjusments, zoom; etc. become a breeze to navigate.- The expression button under the thumb brings a whole new layer of functionality (until it breaks).CONS:- Pricey, but might be worth it depending on your needs.- The back and forward buttons are crammed on top of the other and way into the back of the thumb side of the mouse, difficult to access and tell apart from each other just by feel.- Connectivity issues, especially on Bluetooth, not so much with the included USB receiver. They have improved over time with software updates, but still present from time to time.AND NOW FOR THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE OF THIS MOUSE: THE EXPRESSION BUTTON BREAKS.I know this is not an isolated issue with my unit only as I went online to search for a fix and a lot of people were having the same problem. There are even YouTube video tutorials on how to fix that button.At first the button was great, adding a ton of functionality. Basically you hold down on it with your thumb and the cursor is disabled so you can do \"gestures\" or mouse movements that will control functions like volume, change songs, or whatever you configure in the app.I had it set so that I while pressing the gesture button and moving the mouse up or down will change the volume. Sideways would skip music tracks. That was a great feature to have and it saved me a lot of time.The button started being very clicky and responsive, then after a while it started to become mushy, but it still worked ok. Some time later, it was so sensitive that normal resting of the thumb on it would activate it, triggering the gestures at unwanted times.Finally it became stuck, rendering the mouse unusable. In gesture mode, you cannot move the cursor. In my case, trying to do so would only change the volume and music tracks. I had to move the mouse around, place it upside down and bang it slightly with my hand to TRY to free it again. It was a pain and it seldom worked.Finally, I gave up and had to disable the gestures altogether from the app.I was so used to that feature that I became frustrated for not having it after a while. So I followed the tutorials posted by others having the same problem and opened the mouse to adjust some screws that hold the button mechanism in place. This is not very easy, because you have to remove the sliding pad under the mouse to access the screws that hold the case together. This piece is GLUED to the mouse, so you have to be careful not to break it while pulling it off and, when you're done, you need to glue it back again.This worked for a little while and then it became stuck again. I did it again but it failed AGAIN within a couple weeks.Ultimately I gave up, because it was just not worth it to do that painful repair every couple weeks to keep that button working.CONCLUSION:I keep using the mouse as of today because, other than the gesture button breaking, it is comfortable and works well on the other aspects. But still I feel let down by Logitech after spending $100 on a mouse with an issue like this.",
          "I love this mouse, Logitech's bluetooth devices connect so smoothly (I use the MX Master Keyboard too), it feels nice and is easy to keep clean, the scroll wheel momentum is very satisfying and super helpful for editing video in programs like Adobe Premiere or zooming to the top or bottom of a webpage, the thumb scroll wheel is helpful for niche side-scrolling use, and it's super nice to click the button on the bottom to switch between multiple workstations (I used to bring my mouse back and forth from home to my office).The only improvement that would be nice is making the clicking sound quieter. I feel I'm disturbing my roommates when I'm playing a game or doing work that requires a lot of clicking.",
          "Love this mouse but a little over a year in and the optical light that tracks the mouse's movement has started to not work, making the mouse useless.Love this mouse like crazy, but the longevity at this price point is unfortunate.  Any thoughts on how to fix the tracker light?",
          "I've had gaming mice. I have had ergonomic mice. I have had the best and also the cheapest.I always come back to Logitechhere are my reasons1. Seemless installation, immediate use. it's as simple as popping that USB dongle in my PC and done. Or opening Bluetooth on my laptop and connecting.2. 3 system selection. I can have one mouse configured to 3 devices. this really helps when I am working on my PC, need to switch to my laptop and then over to my internet PC (to renew my connection). click the button and away we go.3. Awesome software, immediate button mapping, speed settings and then forget it and go.4. great finger and thumb support. I never end up with a numb or sore hand.5. it's great for gaming.6. it's awesome as both a wireless and connected mouse.7. The price should sell anyone on buying this mouse. It runs gaming mice into the ground and is half the price of most of them.8. easy to clean.9, super long life battery. I recharge my mouse about once a week. sometimes longer.10. recharges in 1 hour or less.11. Cats are interested in it despite it being a mouse.cons.Ready? NONE.",
          "Great ergonomics, and I have an XL hand. Nice extra buttons. Internal battery life Is amazing and super quick charging when needed. Highly recommended.",
          "I knew this was the mouse I wanted. Any of the Logitech MX Master models would have been fine by me. I purchased this one because of the better deal Amazon had it for sale for. I tried a bunch of mice recently and I kept trying to find something comparable or alternate to this mouse that would have the same ergonomics, build quality feel and refinement for a cheaper price. And sure there are a lot of them out there that might be able to do the job but this definitely feels extremely premium in your hand. I feel good paying the price I did for it. There are such useful buttons placed throughout the mouse and ergonomics was definitely kept in mind when designing this mouse. your thumb has 4 available functions! I found that insanely smart. I know this model and the MX Master in general have been out in the market for a long time now and many if not all that know mice know this one for sure. I tried really hard to stay away and just try to find a cheaper solution but with all the special features this comes with and how responsive it is overall, you just can't beat this mouse. It was packaged really well, came with a micro-usb charging cable (I know, its out-dated and should have been type-c but it really doesnt make that much of a difference to me) and was bluetooth ready. Connecting the mouse is extremely easy and if you still want to refer to some instructions to make sure there is a slim easily-peelable sticker on the bottom of the mouse illustrating all the directions on how to connect. The usb unifying device is literally plug and play and if you want to free up a usb slot then you can connect from bluetooth. The bluetooth connection process is seemless. Just go to bluetooth settings and add the mouse. The mouse will then automatically offer to download logitech options which is specifically for logitech devices. This program would allow you to change and modify all mouse settings possible to personalize the mouse to the user. This is where the higher premium price tag comes in play! When you think about what you paid, its honestly a great deal. I have yet to find another mouse that would offer this to you. If you take anything away from this, just always know you get what you pay for. This was worth it for sure!",
          "Me agrado la durabilidad de la bateria, los botones extras, el material se nota de calidad.",
          "Great product for the money",
          "I bought it more than a month ago, the package arrived in perfect condition and it was what I bought.I charged it and use it daily for hours sometimes for more than 16 continuous hours and it has enough charge for a good time.I do not give it five stars because the side buttons are very united and are in an uncomfortable position, I am a photographer I use it with Photoshop and Lightroon and I love it, I recommend it perfectly.",
          "I have used this mouse for many years. In many respects, it's a great mouse, but it has a significant design flaw and I would not purchase this again.The two buttons on top of the mouse are flush with the front. This makes it extremely easy to trigger accidental clicks if you even just lightly run into an object on your desk. For example, I am always hitting my coffee cup or some other object on my messy desk. I've just now accidentally sent a message I did not intend to. For the same reason, it's also very easy to accidentally right-click and errantly select 'cut' from the dialog menu.If they could just redesign this to add a hard lip to the front this would be a perfect mouse.",
          "I have been using an original MX Master (which I\u2019ll call MXM for brevity) at the office for the past three years and it is by far my favorite mouse, until the MX Master 2 (though for my uses they are largely the same).Scroll wheels on mice have been a real pain for me in the past, it seems like scroll wheels on every mouse I\u2019ve used prior to the MXM were junk. They were always janky where clicks wouldn\u2019t register, or scrolling just wasn\u2019t smooth. I was talking with a guy at work a few years ago about this and he let me test-drive his MXM for an hour and I loved it, so I immediately purchased one.I have used it with zero problems for the last few years, and I\u2019m still addicted to quickly scrolling through web pages, code files, spreadsheets, etc by using the smooth-as-butter quick scrolling feature. For me the scroll wheel alone is worth the price, but of course it has plenty of other really useful features.At home I was using an MX Anywhere mouse because I travel frequently, so the smaller form-factor is nice. However, it does feel a bit too cramped and when I use it I miss the ergonomics and smooth scrolling. I finally decided to get another MX Master (this one being the MX Master 2). I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t buy this sooner!It\u2019s basically the same as the original MXM with a few added features. The MXM 2 supports \u201cFlow\u201d software which allows you to seamlessly use the mouse across multiple computers (up to three) without having to manually change the connection on the bottom of the mouse. You can also copy and paste files across multiple computers, provided you copy/paste by using the mouse itself rather than keyboard shortcuts. The MXM 2 also supports higher resolution (up to 4,000 DPI) and longer battery life.The thumb gesture button on the MXM 2 does feel a slight bit mushier than the original but for me it's easier to click. I see a lot of people complaining about the forward/back thumb buttons being set too far back making them uncomfortable to use, but I have adapted to using them a bit differently. Rather than pulling my thumb back and searching for the correct button I simply keep my thumb in its natural position and rock it up/down, letting the side of my thumb hit the buttons. It only took me a short time to get used to doing it this way, but it feels completely natural.This mouse is super comfortable to use all day long. It is a bit on the larger side so if you have smaller hands then it might not be ideal for you.The MXM  really does work on every surface I\u2019ve tested on. My coffee table has a glass top and no other mouse works fluidly on it, except the MXM series.I don\u2019t do much PC gaming outside of playing Civ, which doesn\u2019t require twitch accuracy, but I\u2019ve heard a number of people say it\u2019s not an ideal gaming mouse. I will take their word for it, so if you\u2019re looking for a gaming mouse then I\u2019d do a little more searching around. That being said, for productivity it works flawlessly.Finally, if you have an original MXM and it\u2019s still working well for you then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth upgrading unless something like Flow is something you will find really useful.",
          "I recently purchased this computer mouse, as it has rave reviews, and I am extremely impressed with it. The mouse is highly customizable, with many different buttons that can be programmed to perform different actions. This makes it very easy to use and customize to my needs.The mouse is also cross-device compatible, so I can use it with multiple devices without any issues. It was also very easy to set up, requiring only a few simple steps to get it up and running.One of the things I love about this mouse is that it is ergonomic, so it is comfortable to use for long periods of time. However, I would not recommend leaving it on while being away from the computer for a long period of time, such as the weekend. This can cause the batteries to drain, and it is better to turn the mouse off when not in use.Overall, I would give this mouse 5 stars. It is ergonomic, customizable, and easy to set up. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a high-quality computer mouse.",
          "Bought the MX Master 2S along with the Logi Craft keyboard to switch between my Win desktop, MacBook Pro, and Win work laptop and negate some clutter on my desktop.In a word, this functionality is glorious.  I have only had some small Bluetooth disconnect issues from the keyboard, but nothing substantial that a quick power off and back on after switching doesn't take care of.  I've been using both peripherals this week in relation to work and my side consulting business on  3 machines and I couldn't be happier.  Very little lag and the mouse has always connected to the device I'm switching to at the time - around 10+ device changes per day.My only complaint, thus 4 stars instead of 5, is with Logitech QC.I'm currently staring at a stack of 4 prior Logitech keyboards and 2 mice of various models I've used over the last few years that still work and I need to find a home for.  The brand has been rock solid to me. I've used Logitech at work and home for productivity, gaming, and travel and never once have I been let down - until my initial  shipment of the MX Master 2S.  I immediately felt that the scroll wheel didn't feel  'right' but installed the Logitech Options software on all 3 of my machines for both the Craft keyboard and the mouse.  On all 3 different operating systems, the mouse worked fine except for the scroll wheel - which is a deal breaker.I really needed to get my new setup in place quickly so I re-ordered, applied for a refund, and shipped off the defective mouse.  The new one came 2 days later and the scroll wheel felt better right out of the box.  After pairing and connecting to all 3 devices, I was elated to find  that the scroll wheel instantly worked as it should.After a week with this mouse and the Craft keyboard to accompany it, I am completely satisfied despite the small Bluetooth quirks I mentioned from the keyboard.  So much so that in conjunction with the Samsung CJ34J791 ultra-wide monitor, I simply cannot go back to my previous setup.  That's how much I love it  - I was able to condense 2 different desk setups into 1 saving space in my home office.In summary, my heart really wants to give 5 stars and after a week of use, this mouse deserves the rating.  However, the 4-star review is mostly to alert prospective buyers to a potential issue with the scroll wheel.  If the scroll wheel doesn't work - don't spend hours trying to troubleshoot - just return it for another that hopefully works and enjoy the results.",
          "I already have the MX 3 version from Logitech, and this one is almost the exact replica. I love this mouse and how I can switch from one pc to another. The only things I don't like are that when spinning the wheel is noisier than the MX 3, and also the back and forward buttons are right next to the horizontal scroll wheel, and I sometimes press them by accident. I would change the location of this buttons, but after deactivated them I have not issues when I press them by accident",
          "This mouse is really smooth, precise, and feels comfortable.  Should I mention the battery life is amazing?",
          "I love the idea of all the features it offers but, in practice, they're underwhelming and just a little too...clunky.My biggest issue is with the primary scroll wheel. I was expecting it to be smooth and tight; Instead, it felt clunky and springy. Even when you shift wheel modes, it still feels very loose and imprecise. What confuses me though is that the thumb scroll wheel actually feels perfect. I don't get why they didn't give that treatment to the main wheel. I would just use that as my main, but\u2014even with all the customization available\u2014you can't just assign that as your primary scroll wheel. I tried dialing in various mouse settings and just seeing if I'd get used to it after a few weeks, but it still drives me crazy.The rest of the features are fine but personally underwhelming. The ergonomics, tracking, rechargeability, and trimode connection are decent but no better than my other $20 mouse.The Gestures feature was a neat addition but also feels clunky\u2014instead of smooth, natural, and snappy as gestures should be.The Flow feature was another that really appealed to me but was disappointing. It's a powerful feature and is probably as smooth as you could reasonably ask, but I have a unique setup and it ended up being more annoying than helpful.I love the look of the mouse though. I'm gonna miss aspects of it.",
          "I got an original MX Master, and returned it because it died on me. I then got an MX Master 3, and returned it because I absolutely hate how its mouse wheel functions. I've had my MX Master 2S for about 8 months, now, and it freaking RULES.Battery life is insane. I have to charge it *maybe* once a month, and I sit at my computer, mousing away, for 6-12 hours a day, every day. And charging just involves plugging it into a USB cable for a few hours, during which I can still use the mouse just fine.The unusual back and forward buttons took a few days to get used to, but now I love them. The sideways scroll wheel doesn't seem that great for horizontal scrolling, but I do that so rarely that I may have just not gotten used to the quirks, yet. The regular clicks feel great, and the mouse wheel works exactly how I like it.This mouse is a *steal* for its current price of $57. There are much more expensive mice that are much worse than this thing.",
          "At $80-90, it's way more than I ever wanted to spend on a mouse, but it's the only one other than the Razer Orochi that met my specifications, so I bit the bullet.  I like it.  It's comfortable to use, has a premium build quality, and the the Flow feature is neat.  Things that stick out to me:Pros:--The scroll wheel can switch between ratcheting and free-spinning.  By default the button right below the wheel toggles this, but you can set it to something else, or set it digitally via the Logitech drivers.  Additionally, the wheel can shift between the two automatically based on how rigorously you're spinning it (the sensitivity for the auto-shift can also be set)--The area right below where your thumb sits is secretly a button!  I didn't realize this at all until I took a close look at the button assignment settings in the Logitech drivers.--I like that the Logitech Options software doesn't sit in your system tray, like Logitech's gaming software does.  I just didn't want to have two different Logitech drivers sitting in my tray, I'm weird like that.--Like with their gaming hardware, all of the buttons on here can be given keystroke assignments, if the pre-loaded functions aren't doing it for you.  You can't record macros, though.Cons:--For this price Logitech ought to have included a carrying case, as I just know I'm eventually going to lose the wireless receiver if I'm not careful.  I've bought cheaper mice that came with carrying cases.--It doesn't seem like this mouse can be used wired, despite coming with a USB cable.  It's not like I bought a wireless mouse to use wired, but I feel like if you make a wireless mouse with a USB port, it should have a wired mode.--The thumb wheel isn't very useful.  The things that I might like to use it for (scrolling through pictures, maybe panning across an image) just don't work that well, and the things it does do well at (volume control, screen brightness) aren't really that crucial or time-saving.  Right now I have it set to scroll through applications.EDIT September 2020So I've now owned this mouse for nearly three years.  Most of my thoughts on it written above still hold: I've yet to find much use for the thumb wheel (as much as I like the idea), but the mouse is otherwise pleasant to use.  However, I've decided I also don't like the gesture button (the 'secret' thumb rest button I mentioned above) very much.  It has a very mushy feel that sometimes makes me second-guess myself when pressing it.  And more importantly, it seems to have eventually contributed to partially bricking the mouse.A couple of weeks ago, I had an issue where the mouse stopped tracking.  The buttons and wheels still worked, but I couldn't move the cursor at all.  The gesture button seems to have been the culprit: I had to open up the mouse with some precision screwdrivers and loosen the circuitry for the gesture button to get the sensor to work again.  I've since disabled the gesture button altogether in Logitech's software.",
          "I have owned the previous MX Master for over two years. It was amazing in pretty much every respect. Over time it got scratched up from being in my travel bag so when the new version came out, I jumped on it. I've had no regrets since. It's everything the original version offered plus more.The MX Master 2S is overall unchanged physically. Same button placement, same shape, same size. The only identifiable thing are the new colors. The previous black+bronze was nice but curious color choice - a bit steampunk if you ask me. The new color options, blue, white, and black on graphite (my choice) is a more traditional color for peripherals.In terms of buttons, it's the same as the previous model - two main buttons on top, scroll wheel that acts as a third button and a wheel lock button to freespin the wheel when you need it. The main two top buttons feel clickier or crisper than my previous mouse. I don't know if Logitech changed the mechanism or my old mouse is just worn out. However the more tactile feel is a welcome change. The free spin button is something unique that I have not seen on any other mouse. Normally the wheel is a friction wheel offering bumpy tactile feel. This is useful for precise scrolling. When you click the center button, the mouse releases the friction of the mouse and allows it to free spin. This is immensely useful if you need to scroll quickly for large spreadsheets, documents, or webpages. I am a photographer and designer and having free spin is great for changing brush sizes, brush hardness, opacity, and other options in photo editing programs.There is also a horizontal scroll wheel and two buttons on the thumb. Admittedly I barely ever use the thumb scroll but it's a useful wheel to have to assign it to creative uses. The two forward and backward buttons unfortunately haven't changed at all. Most people complained about the size and shape of these. It's hard to touch-press them unless you're very used to the mouse. This has not changed at all. These buttons really need to be larger.Finally there is a hidden \"gesture\" button on thumb pad underneath the soft rubber. You push down to switch between windows in Windows 10. Alternatively you can assign this to something more useful. I almost never use it since I alt-tab everything. If you didn't know this button was there you would probably miss it. It is well hidden and the press down is awkward. Either way, it's an extra button you can use creatively.Overall the mouse design is excellent. The size is perfect and the slightly slanted wedge design is great to save your wrists from carpal tunnel injury over long time use. This is SIGNIFICANTLY better than a traditional flat mouse (I'm looking at you Apple Magic Mouse). While it's not a perfectly vertical mouse, it's large enough for your hands to cup it naturally and pivot on your wrist bone for more precise movements with less pain.My favorite feature is the multi-system switch button. On the bottom there is a button to switch between 3 systems. Previously there was a separate connect button that Logitech smartly did away with. Now there is just one button, press once to switch between 1, 2, or 3, and hold down to put the mouse in search/connect mode for a new device. This feature is simply amazing. I have a desktop, a laptop, and my fiance has a laptop. We all have each system assigned to a number. Simply one press will let you seamlessly switch between systems. There is no lag. There is no delay. There is no reconnect. Once you've paired it, you never have to do it again. The mouse works with Logitech's universal dongle as well as bluetooth. Honestly bluetooth is all you ever really need. I have the dongle on my desktop and just use bluetooth on the two other laptops. This is by far the BEST FEATURE of this mouse. I don't need to buy extra mice for other systems, I just take the same mouse with me.The mouse also works on pretty much every surface I've tried it on. I have a black table and several mice have given up working on it. They work for a bit but loose their way. I've tried this on really dark furniture, mouse pads, and even glass. It takes all surfaces like a champ!The second best feature is the battery. I have used other wireless mice such as Razr, other Logitech, and Apple. The batteries for these mice area lacking in battery life. Nothing is worse than working or playing a game and the battery dies mid-way. Typically those batteries last a few days at best. The MX Master 2S WILL LAST YOU WEEKS. I got mine two weeks ago and I still haven't charged it since. If it does die, it will prompt you on screen and you can charge while you continue working.Overall this is the best wireless mouse I've ever used. I would not hesitate to buy it. It is a bit pricey though, for good reason. If you can find it on sale, DEFINITELY buy! You won't look back!If this review helped, or managed to get this far, why not give me me a like? Thanks :)",
          "I bought this same mouse in 2018 and it finally died. Mouse was taped together at the buttons to keep them clicking. Bought another because it lasted so long.",
          "Excelente inversi\u00f3n. F\u00e1cil y vers\u00e1til.",
          "I bought this mouse to use the Logitech Flow feature while working at home. It works great. Much better than having to switch mice and keyboard when switching systems. There is a little pause when switching, but you get used to it. Overall a nice mouse, but like all Logitech mice I\u2019ve owned, the left mouse button wears out after a year or so of daily use. The button works, but it no longer reliably allows me to drag and drop. The button releases when I think I\u2019m holding down. I can get it to work more reliably by pressing near the front (end where the cable normally comes out of), but I normally press the middle of the button. I\u2019ve had this happen on all my Logitech mice over the years and just replace them every year or two. I\u2019d definitely pay a little more for a mouse with better switches.",
          "I would recommend against giving this as a gift, as technical issues quickly soured the experience.I opened the new box, plugged in USB dongle, downloaded the Logi Options+ software, and was immediately met with lag and constant disconnections. Fortunately I'm good with computers and was able to fix this.  Made sure the mouse was connected to my PC via USB dongle and not bluetooth, went into device manager, and disabled power management on the USB port the dongle was plugged into.However, this was never an issue with previous mice I've used. And critically, most people wouldn't know to do that and would have no clue why it keeps disconnecting.To be fair the mouse is nice, though still made of a light plastic. It glides across the desk very smoothly. The scroll wheel is great too, but I kind of wish I went with the 3S model for the bare metal wheel. I also wish the mouse had optional weights like my previous corsair m65 (which started double clicking/breaking after 2 years) - the extra heft gives a greater perception of quality (to me, at least). All in all, for 70 it's pretty alright.",
          "I finally decided to retire my Logitech G5... it still worked fine, I just wanted something newer.  Since I had a good mouse for so long, though, I hadn't really kept current with the market.  Even though the Master 3 is on the market, it seemed like the Logitech MX Master 2S was the better buy.  At $70 you get a mouse with solid build quality.  The controls are logically laid out, assuming you're right-handed.  Generous amounts of Teflon on the bottom of the mouse assure smooth movement.  I did notice that the mouse sits up a bit higher than I'm used to... either I need to not use my thick mousepad, or I need to make sure that I use my wrist rest.  I use the mouse with the Unifying receiver, and will probably purchase at least one more USB dongle.  The Logitech software is a little bloat-y, but at least it's for a peripheral, and not something like ARGB control....As far as stuff I don't like, I really only have one thing... the vertical scrollwheel kind of rattles.  It's a little disconcerting, considering how nice the rest of the mouse is.  Also, it's a stark contrast to the horizontal scrollwheel, which is really nice.Overall, the mouse is great.  In fact, I'm not sure what the Master 3 would have going for it that would make it worth the extra $30 for me.  As it is, the Master 2S looks and feels like a flagship mouse, at a completely reasonable $70.  Recommended",
          "Definitely worth the price",
          "This is the best mouse I ever owned. The wheel continues rolling, which is handy when you need to scroll a lot like in excel or other data files.The feel is awesome too. It is heavy so you have a good feel where you are moving the pointer.Lastly, the side scroll is handy to scroll the horizontal bar. I don't use it often but it really helps to discover from time to time if something is hiding on the right side of the screen.Charging is great too. When the battery is low, just plug it into usb-c charge cable and keep working.As a computer programmer, this is the best mouse I ever owned.",
          "I have had the MX Master 2S for a little over a year now and I've loved it. It feels great. There are multiple buttons, all customizable, that allow you to tailor the mouse to your own preferences and create great workflows.The only problem I have with the mouse is it's longevity. About 6 months in I started having problems, specifically with the Gesture Button located on the thumb rest area. It a very handy button to have, which I had mapped to switch between windows, but this button stopped working and I had to troubleshoot. I noticed there were many YouTube videos out there, indicating this was a common problem.Now, just over a year in, the Middle Button has also stopped working. Not having the Gesture Button was livable, but being unable to scroll means I have to replace the mouse.Again, fabulous mouse by design, but evidently not built for durability.",
          "Very nice mouse! Logitech is always my to go computer accessory company.PROS/CONS- Full size mouse. This mouse actually is bigger than my gaming mouses. I own a corsair and 2 logitech gaming mouse. I've added picture for comparison. I didn't compare with my corsair because I have it packed away somewhere and didn't feel like looking for it.So the reason for the size is because unlike my other mice, this one needs to hold a charge.- Continuing with the size, it is not a very good mouse to use on the go. I've added photos for these as well. I didn't have my bag filled up because I just finished my summer class, but when I do the mouse bulges from my bag. It does not seem safe. I feel like if I were to sit with my bag on, i'll squish my mouse. It's an expensive mouse.- Continuing again with size, I got a case to hold the mouse. This adds even MORE girth, making it even harder to store it in my bags. If you really want this mouse for its features, you might want to stick with the Logitech MX Anywhere 2s. It's a lot smaller and it'll fit in your side pockets.- Battery life is amazing. I never have to worry about charging it. Of course this result will vary my usage. I only use this maybe couple hours a day, few days a week. I've charged this mouse once since i've had it, and I've had this for couple months now.- Precision is good as any gaming mouse. Best part is that you can use this mouse ANYWHERE. I love glass table/desks, so anytime I had to use a mouse I had to have a mouse pad. With this mouse, I don't need it anymore. Basically I've NEVER have to worry about using a mouse pad with this mouse.- This is the first wireless mouse I've purchased where you can edit the DPI. I love high sensitivity mice. I usually have my DPI settings at around 8000. This helps a LOT when I use my laptop with my external 28in 4k monitor.- So many buttons! You have the usual front and back button, but you also have a extra button where your thumb lies. All these buttons are customizeable. Also very tactile feeling.- I LOVE the scrolling. You can read how it works, but you have use it to really understand how nice it is to have the auto scrolling feature. This TOO is customizeable. The horizontal scrolling is nice too. I don't use it much, but it's such an underrated part of the mouse. Not having to use the horizontal bar or middle clicking to do the 4 way scrolling is amazing.- The only one MAJOR con i've faced other than the size is related to the scrolling. The auto scrolling feature sometimes hickups. It would either lag or stop scrolling. Only way I've managed to fix this is refreshing the web page. I'm sure this can be fixed with a software update, but taking a star off for that.- I haven't used the FLOW feature yet, so... yeah.",
          "My son is in computer programming and he stated this really is a great mouse\u2026. Only issue is there is no place to attach the plug in for computer when you are not using it. Taking off top to tuck it inside is not an option.",
          "It has been 6 years since I went shopping for a new mouse, my last one was Logitech too.  It still works, but I decided to stray and try another gaming mouse and that was a mistake on many levels.  Now my other Logitech mouse is with a family member who won't give it up (understandably so), and so I went to buy the same mouse again for myself, only to find it was discontinued.  My heart dropped a little - my last mouse was Logitech Performance MX Wireless Mouse, and I LOVED it - but then with the stellar reviews of this MX Master 25 mouse, I knew all wasn't lost!Some might balk at paying $70 (or more) for a mouse, but after I had paid that amount for my last Logitech, I knew it was so well worth the money!! And this MX Master 25 is no exception.First of all - the fit to the hand is amazing.  There is no mouse that fits the hand better, there is no straining on any part of the hand or any fingers, my wrist is comfortable, I feel it is the most natural fit and I haven't had that with any other mouse I've tried.Also - with this new Logitech mouse, the ability for it to control 3 laptops at the same time is great!! My desktop space is extremely thankful!! I got rid of 2 wired mice, freed up a USB port to boot since one connected via bluetooth, and now, when I want to to a little gaming on the side when the workday is otherwise slow, I just flick the switch  on the mouse and I'm in business and same going back.  Very convenient for sure.Anyway - I use this mouse for everything, including heavy PC gaming - I promise you, o Logitech, I will never stray towards another mouse again, no matter how many fancy lights they put on it!!!(And judging by the durability of my last one, it'll probably be awhile before I feel the need to look at another mouse anyway .....)So - yes - if the price tag is holding you back on this one, I just want to say go for it.  It's worth every penny and also,  there won't be a need to buy another mouse for years (assuming the durability of this one is the same as the previous ones) AND this is now 3 mice for the price of one as well so - there you have it!! :)"

          "This year, I've been getting more serious about my home and how I want things to be here. One of those things that I've long thought about but only recently put any real effort into is the living room \"atmosphere\". I've long had dreams of a great audio-video entertainment setup out there, and this year it all came into focus for me and I finally knew what I wanted to do. Believe it or not, this keyboard is central to that idea, though I also recently killed my desktop computer's wired keyboard, so now it's seeing use full time.Basically, my living room now has an excellent 5 speaker (two fronts, two rears and a subwoofer) sound system, and a TV wired to the secondary video output of my desktop computer. That TV is soon going to be replaced by a Vizio 32\" Smart HDTV unit, so that the computer's video will be clear enough to use properly without a magnifier application to help with reading print on-screen. That's where this keyboard comes in. I needed a wireless keyboard that could work the computer from the living room (the desktop machine is in the bedroom) without pesky signal dropout issues and thus nitpicky placement. I'm pleased to say that so far it works perfectly. I paired it up with a  Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse, and though the mouse's placement is indeed a little picky, the keyboard works great. Now I can sit out there and bring up whatever I want on the computer, be it a video file, some YouTube or Amazon Instant Video entertainment, music, or my usual run of mad science research, no problemo. I can even check my bank account, pay my bills, all the usual things I do when I'm at the computer properly. Once I get the HDTV, I'll be able to do all that and more without the blurry, indistinct detail that goes with a CRT television. Skyrim in HDTV and Bose surround sound, OMG **** yes. :-)So what is this keyboard really like? Well, it's thin, it's very compact, it's very light, and it does feel a bit cheap. That said, it's got little feets in the back to prop it up at an angle, which gives the feel of a proper keyboard, and thank the Gods, it's a full, proper, keyboard layout with no sensation of the keys being scrunched together. At least, I don't notice it, and I type using just my left thumb and both index fingers WITHOUT looking at the keyboard (don't ask me how I learned to do that, but I can wing out 40WPM easy now this way), so keyboard format is EVERYTHING to me. It speaks volumes that I could go over to this thing so quickly and not immediately hate it, like how I feel about my laptop keyboard. I would NOT be hard on this thing, physically - I don't feel like it's built to be durable under abuse. I also would NEVER spill anything on it if at all possible, because surely it would be easy to kill this way and you don't want to go killing your nice wireless keyboard.I don't use mouse or keyboard software, so I can't comment on that. What I can tell you is that I really like this thing, I'm impressed by its range and I'm good with how it feels, and definitely I'd buy it again. Nice, especially if you need something super portable, reasonably compact, and very lightweight. It also has an on/off switch for those times that you want to save battery power... though I'm not sure it's really necessary. Nice keyboard!As usual, I'll come back and give an update if for whatever reason I think I need to.Rick NR417",

I wish I knew how to turn them off if that's even possible.I usually have much better luck with Logitech keyboards. My last one lasted several years and that was with me using it for gaming and working from home part-time. I am not the easiest on the top of the keyboards -- the actual keys -- because I usually have nails and I am a \"hard\" typist. I'm 51 so I learned to type on an actual typewriter so it's my nature to press the keys harder than I'm sure they need it.But I do take care of my things so I was very surprised yesterday when one of the back \"legs\" or \"kickstands\" broke almost in half when my boyfriend just barely touched the top leaning over me to pick something up off the floor. Unfortunately I have arthritis in my hands so I need the elevation of the legs/kickstands to type comfortably. I'm going to try some Gorilla Super Glue and see if that works.",
          "I was getting tired of the Dell keyboard that came with a desktop PC I bought so decided to purchase an upgrade to replace that. I wasn't expecting the significant improvement over the Dell keyboard. But typing on the K270 reminds me of what you used to get when you bought a new desktop PC. Definitely more enjoyable to type on then the Dell's chicklet keys.  I also have a Logitech K840 mechanical which I like for gaming but not so much for general typing. I would not hesitate to recommend the K270 for a good keyboard.",
          "I have to replace my keyboard 2-3 times a year because I scratch the letters (mostly ASDFCEW, that area) off with my nails. Why on earth did I not bother to get a cover sooner? Shame on me. I'd rather replace the cover 2-3 times a year (if it even comes to that) should I slice a hole in it, scratch it up, etc for $8.00 a pop than a new keyboard and mouse combo for $20.00 - $30.00 a pop... what a no-brainer. Fits the suggested logitech keyboard (bought them together) like a glove. Would also be extremely useful for clumsy people who slosh their drinks around alot or eat at their keyboards. Feels a bit weird at first typing on it but you get used to it. 10/10.",

Simple plug and play with no setup or driver downloads necessary. It worked perfectly straight out of the box.If you are a hardcore gamer looking for low response rates, this is not what this keyboard was built to do.At this price point, if you are looking for a solid, all around wireless keyboard with good battery life, useful multimedia buttons, and standard Windows keys with a numpad, the K270 backed by one of the most well known peripheral companies, is a solid choice.",
          "As a professional typist with decades of 12-14 hour days of doing nothing but just typing, I am very picky about keyboards.

          "\u00a0with double-sided scotch tape to the surface of my keyboard slider.  I placed new liner in honor of my new keyboard and voila, no slipping and sliding.The placement of the keys on this Logitech K270 keyboard are the nearest to the original placement of most of the keyboards I read reviews for.  As a longtime typist the changing of major key placement and altering of the spacing between groups of keys always appears counter-productive to me.  I don't understand the trend toward re-inventing the keyboard by every major keyboard manufacturer, but it continues to occur with even more frequency as the years roll by.  This keyboard presented no problems for me whatsoever in that aspect.  It sports a standard, full-size layout which I appreciate.  I do however like the addition above the the F function keys, of several  small short cut keys.  I particularly enjoy the keys that takes me to my home page and to my e-mail (both with no set up required by me at all).  There are also keys to increase, decrease, and mute the volume of videos, music, etc which I find helpful.  There is also a key that brings up a calculator to the screen.I haven't had the keyboard long enough to encounter the need to replace the two AAA batteries required.  The length of the battery power is estimated at 24 months or 2 million keystrokes per year.  Now that I don't type all day everyday it might take me awhile to get to 2 million keystrokes in a year.There is an off/on switch on the keyboard to preserve battery power; however, I never turn mine off, nor do I turn off my wireless mouses.  Just not a habit I ever developed.  I would rather just change the batteries.  I also have not utilized the feature available to allow just the one receiver for the keyboard and other compatible items such as your logitech mouse, but I have no reason to doubt that it wouldn't work perfectly as advertised.All in all this was easiest to set up computer keyboard I have encountered in years.  The keyboard itself has everything required to make someone used to typing on a standard keyboard completely satisfied with the purchase.  I recommend it highly.",

It has a low, slim profile with 'flip-out feet' on the back for a slight angle. Grippers on the back keep the keyboard in place without leaving marks behind.

My only quibble is that it would be nice to have the shift lock indicator be on the left shift key, rather than on the upper right of the keyboard. Highly recommended.",

          "\u00a0of which I have two that I use daily and which I find the best mouse on the market.  However, the description and reviews of the Logitech K270 seemed the most positive of all the keyboards and at $28.75 it was in my price range.  I would have preferred to purchase it locally because I have a history of having to return keyboards because of being unhappy with the touch, sticking keys right out of the box, horrible configurations and key spacing, etc.  However, no local business carries this keyboard in stock.I set aside an entire evening to set up my new keyboard, again based on previous history, and also because it was wireless, a new type of keyboard for me.  I had a lot of extra time left for other endeavors that evening.  Simply put; I opened the box, removed the keyboard and receiver from box, inserted the receiver in my computer tower, pulled out the paper tab from the battery door on the bottom of the keyboard, flipped out the feet on the bottom of the keyboard, turned the keyboard on, and started to type.  I was amazed and pleased but I thought it was too early to review the product, I wanted to give it awhile to check out the actual fact of typing with this lightweight, well designed keyboard.The next morning I started with the new keyboard and wanted to test the touch and design of the keys placement on the board.  Within 15 minutes I had forgotten that I was supposed to be trying out a keyboard; it simply became my keyboard.  Now 24 days later I finally remembered I had never reviewed the product.  That is because in that 24 days I have never actually given much thought at all to the fact that I am typing on a NEW keyboard.  This was pretty much my first seamless keyboard replacement.I am of course aware that I don't have to keep adjusting the wire from the keyboard to the computer, that I don't have to adjust the sliding drawer where my keyboard rests because the wire is caught on something, that the wire isn't tangled in my feet because it is drooping to the floor, that the wire isn't keeping me from opening the sliding drawer far enough, and all those problems I have endured for years because I thought a wireless keyboard might not be responsive to my need for speed.  In that regard, I have yet to notice anything, other than the lack of the physical wire, that tells me I am typing on a wireless keyboard.The touch of this keyboard just seems normal to me and hasn't caught my attention at all.  This keyboard is designated as being Long-Range Wireless.  My keyboard and computer tower are very close in proximity, so that was a feature I didn't need.  However, I have tested this out and I can type on this keyboard down the hall from my office and into the dining room (next room over from office) and the response is fine.  The second room over stretches the keyboards wireless limits and it starts to drop letters. I did not measure the distance. All in all this did not present a problem for me though.  I never notice slowless or dropped letters or non-responsiveness where it matters, at my desk or in the next room either.The little feet on the bottom prop the keyboard at just the correct angle for me.  I used to have to keep an additonal prop aid under my Saitek keyboard to get the cant just right.  There is no wrist rest on this Logitech where there was on my Saitek.  It took approximately 15 minutes for me not to miss it.My sliding drawer or keyboard tray is formica and like every keyboard I have had, the keyboard is a bit inclined to slide, but I long ago affixed rubbery-like shelf line\u00a0",
          "This may just have been a single instance of the product not going thru enough finishing touches or maybe all of these keyboards have sharp edges near the left ctrl key and numpad enter key.

          "Seems to be fine.  I wonder how long the on/off switch will last as it seems a little weak.  I like that the caps lock key has a little extra plastic to differentiate it from the tab and shift key.  Full travel, but this also allows for crumbs and dust to get under the keys easily.I can't speak to the battery life or gaming as it is new and I am not a gamer.  Response time seems fine to me, but I'll have to see as batteries age.  Key caps have bright lettering and while no backlighting, seem to illuminate better than expected.",

          "I don't do gaming, but spend a lot of time on my computer.  This keyboard, I found, is pretty quiet.  Not sure why everyone says that it's noisy.  I also found a lot of questions as to whether it's a nano or unifying keyboard.  The K270 I received IS unifying.  Came with the little plug in with the orange star.  Some people are saying that theirs's didn't come with one.  IF YOU BUY THE K270 THAT COMES WITH A MOUSE, IT IS NOT  UNIFYIING, but comes with a nano dongle.  THE  K270 I JUST RECEIVED DID NOT COME WITH A MOUSE AND IT IS UNIFYING.  That may help to answer why some people have the unifying one or the nano one.  Also, the little dongle was attached to the side of the box.  Everything came out, except the dongle.  Looked inside the box and there it was, stuck to the side, really stuck.  Looked like nothing was in the box.  Love this keyboard.  My last one was a Logitech K520 with the wrist rest.  I bought a wrist rest for this K270 since it doesn't have one and love the whole set up.  Just got it today, so unsure on how well it will last or how the letters, etc stay clear from wearing on the keyboard.  Set up so easy.  Good price. Happy camper.",
          "This keyboard is everything I expected and more. I was working off of a standard Dell plug-in keyboard for over 10 years. I hated the cord, and how much the keyboard slid around on my desk. But, I could not convince myself to replace it. I work long hours and need everything to be just so for maximum efficiency. I cannot work on a quiet keyboard, it slows me down too much because it feels so different, and if I try to go normal speed I have a ton of typos.This Logi keyboard is similiar to my old Dell keyboard in that the depression distance of the keys is about the same (not super short like the quiet keyboards), and the keys are springy like they are on my old Dell keyboard (quiet keyboard keys do not bounce back on your fingers when your typing). The main difference between the Logi and my old Dell keyboard is that while the keys feel like the old loud keyboard, they are much quieter, but not as quiet as a quiet keyboard. You would not think the sound of the keyboard would matter, but I have been so tuned into the noise while typing on my old keyboard that I can hear a typo while it's happening- weird but true. This new Logi keyboard is a good half way between the noise of an old loud keyboard and a quiet keyboard wherein it makes noise but the sound is not so loud it bounces off the walls of my office. I also love that the keyboard does not shift around on my smooth desk-- even with the little tilt feet out.",

It's not the greatest keyboard in the world, but I've never had an issue with it, and it's been put through the wringer (I let my kids play/smash it all the time). It's also super efficient with its battery somehow. I replace the batteries on my wireless mac keyboard probably 5 times more often, and yet they get about the same use. It has performed well beyond my expectations.",

Both my existing mouse and this keyboard work perfectly together!Note: you can\u2019t pair one keyboard/mouse to two receivers.",
          "The fit is PERFECT.  This is for my keyboard in my workshop were dust, metal filings and solvents can drift into the keyboard.  I also may have lubricants or debris on my hands as I type.  The fit will keep all of that nonsense away from the keys...while allowing me full function of the keys.The only downside is that the cover is not clear silicone.  You can barely see the keyboard markings through the cover.  They could have made it solid black with the same level of usefulness.Yes, I CAN type blindfolded...but for a computer keyboard with function keys and a number pad its nice to look down once in awhile.",
          "Good value for this product. It fits the keyboard perfectly. I like the feel of it when I'm typing.",
          "ok",
          "Be aware, you get a wireless keyboard without anything to connect to computer.  Unifying receiver not provided.  ReturningNot returning.  Found the receiver embedded in the box.  Ignore my initial review.",
          "This wireless keyboard works well. I like its minimalist design, with fewer large extra buttons for special features than other keyboards. My subjective experience is that its keys seem to be quieter than other Logitech keyboards I've tried. I do wish it had better range for its wireless communications; I had to relocate the Bluetooth dongle on a USB extender cable to get it close enough for reliable connection to the keyboard.",
          "I had to buy a new keyboard because I spilled coffee all over the old one. When I saw this protective cover, I immediately bought it. The material is so soft and makes typing very quiet. I have taken it off to clean already. I have told everyone I work with about this cover. If you eat or drink at your desk, this is a must!",
          "Very nice keyboard, but too springy for me.",
          "I just love it. Super fast delivery. In hours. Great product. Excellent price!!!",
          "It's been over a year and it's still working well. I haven't had to change the batteries yet.I really like the extra keys on top for volume, email, and putting the PC to sleep.I would buy again.",
          "We buy these because they are cheap and use them for business but we'll have roughly 3 out of every 10 end up with dead keys within a year. I've taken them apart, reseated the membranes, tried new USB keys, nothing works. Something just goes dead in the circuitry.I'll have to just spend a bit more but I've bought my last Logitech keyboard. Tired of this nonsense. Been happening for years with these low end keyboards. It's my fault at this point.",
          "a little background, for the past 5 years I have used a wireless keyboard from a generic company. only recently the wireless transmitter has finally started to go wonky so I set out to get a new keyboard. I tried going on the cheap (got a rocketfish keyboard for $20 on black friday, avoid like the plague) I tried going a little more expensive (got a microsoft keyboard and while it worked adequately, the wireless dongle jutted out in an oblong way that made it difficult for taking it with me) until I finally got this logitech here.first off is the size, it's a compact keyboard, no hand rest and no side buttons like a lot of other keyboards I've used, but it has all full-size keys for the standard buttons so even with its compact size and my mid-large hands I had no issue typing quickly and comfortably.the keyboard is about 17-18 inches long which aloud me to just barely fit it into my book bag which was a definite plus for me since I cannot stand using the computers at my college but I also can't stand the tiny keyboard on my 10.1 inch netbook! the bottom of the unit has a slight curve to it along with the bottom row of keys which I also like since it makes the space bar much larger than a standard rectangle keyboard.the keyboard has eight special hot key buttons which out of the box let you: pause/play a video, mute the sound, lower the volume, raise the volume, go to your homepage, open your email, put the computer on standby, and open a calculator (oddly enough this was the key that got me to finally order this keyboard since it's always ends up being one of my most used hotkeys on any keyboard.) these keys are easy to hit and are actually configurable with the set-point software, more on that later. the keyboard also has an on/off switch.the keyboard is very responsive, with no lag from my testing. one thing that isn't noted in the description is that these keys are fairly loud, personally I like my keys to have a resounding clack to them but that might not be the case for someone else.the unifying receiver is great, it's tiny, is very responsive, and can be used with any other product that uses the same receiver saving usb ports.something that is actually incorrect in the description is the customizability of the keys. it says in the chart in the description that this keyboard can't customize its hotkeys. but after installing the set-point software off of logitech's website I can confirm that they ARE! the keys are easily customizable to initiate just about any program or command. another neat feature is that through the software you can disable keys that are not used very often or cause difficulty in some situations, you can disable keys like the caps lock or scroll lock that serve little purpose during normal use and you can also disable the windows key which is a godsend for anyone who enjoys playing games (the amount of times in the last few years that I have accidentally bumped it during a heated match only to have to wait a minute before I can get back in is easily in the hundreds if not thousands so this made my day.)the battery life of this keyboard is long. I have been using it for over a week and the set-point software still says that the batteries are full. they say it should last 3 years so as of now it appears to be living up to that claim!overall this is a solid keyboard, it has just enough buttons, a small enough amount that they don't get in the way of a casual user but also just enough that a heavy user can still set up macros and make the keyboard their own. everything is just as you'd want it to be. if you're in the market for a new keyboard, do yourself a favor and consider this one. you won't be disappointed.",
          "A step back in technology (apart from the Unifying receiver)...but that's why I bought it.  I came from using Logitech's K780 multi-device keyboard which is a good keyboard, but for work (at home) I got tired of using the function button to access the F keys.  That doesn't seem like a big deal, but when using it for 9+ hours a day, it becomes one.  Even something as simple as a dedicated print screen button, which I use a lot in the course of a work day, is a nice-to-have.The size and layout of the K270 keyboard are similar to the HP desktop keyboards that are used at work.  So the transfer to work from working at home will be smother.  The Unifying function connected with an existing receiver already in use with a Logitech mouse (M570).  Paring was straightforward and seamless.  Prior to pairing and after switching on the keyboard, there is no power indicator that let me know the batteries were fresh.  Upon pairing, however, they keyboard \"came to life\" and began working no issues (still no power indicator on the keyboard itself).  So be wary in thinking this keyboard comes dead on arrival as some reviewers have indicated (though I have no other reason to deny their experience)The key travel is definitely more than the K780's and also louder, more akin to my HP keyboard at work.  Though louder, I wouldn't call the key sound excessively loud and is not distracting to me.  Like anything else, it will take some retraining from the K780, but I don't anticipate any issues.Having the expanded key layout, however, is nice.  And so far everything has worked and am hoping that continues.  I haven't had it long enough to attest to the battery life.One thing about the keyboard is that albeit light weight and not too bulky, those features lend for the keyboard to be a noticeably flexible when pressing down mid span.  It's not an issue when typing and focusing on the task at hand, but I wonder what effect it may have on longevity.  I'm sure that's as design tradeoff (my HP keyboard at work weighs considerably more), but I took a star away for that reason...that, and I rarely give 5 stars for anything.Overall, I do like this keyboard and recommend it for those who want a no-frills basic keyboard with wireless connectivity.",

          "First, why is that 1-star review complaining about the price still there and has so many upvotes. It is not even a verified purchase.I tried the linear and tactile version. Picked the tactile version because I got used to it quicker and appreciated the actuation feedback, which the linear version lacks. Linear is the quietest, but the tactile version is reasonable. You will not bother anyone. I picked this over the apple magic keyboard and corsair mk2 rapid fire. I will include my use case, specs/features, pros, and cons.Since covid, I work from home. I am a software developer, game a bit (3-10 hours) a week, and write a few reports as part of my job a week. The key caps are matte black and soft, which delivers a very nice feel. If you barely tap the keys, you can slide right across them. I do not eat near my keyboard, but the key caps are pretty good at resisting finger grease/oil. Touch typing will help with this as well. I have a 15inch work mac. I did not mind the butterfly keys, but this is better beyond comparison. The \"LightSpeed\" connection over usb does its job. I usually have the usb plugged into my gaming pc and use bluetooth for my work mac. I can transtition between the two just by touching the lightspeed/bluetooth buttons on the keyboard. The layout for mac is different, but i got used to it pretty quick. Being able to use one keyboard for mutiple machines at the touch of a button is incredible. You only need to get used to one keyboard, which greatly improves your typing. I use the macros keys for gaming. game changer. The dedicated media keys are a must have for me now. The volume scroll rod is smooth and the rolling distance matches the change in volume. The keyboard has a brushed metal (probably aluminum) finish. Feels very durable, dense, and premium. Under regular light, dust is very visible. The keyboard pacing is good and no fatigue after all day.The full keyboard is big. 19 inches x 6 inches. good luck finding a soft case for this. I have to use 3 micro fiber cloth to cover this thing when i am away. The keyboard has the back legs. One raises it 4 degress, the other 8 degrees. To me, the 4 degrees is not noticeable. The mechnical switch is visible and almost above the actual board. This contributes to its slim profile. I really wish there was a wrist wrest, so I could get a consistent hand posture and feel. 5 macro keys down the left. full row of function keys, must have for gaming. total of 12 soft rubber-ish buttons for stuff like media, macro controls, and wireless connectivity. Full RGB per key back light only over lightspeed. The backlight customization is limited over bluetooth. I usually have the backlight off... cause i do not look at the keyboard. I really could care less about keyboard rgb. There is a battery and capslock light indicator. Battery life is great. since i do not have the back lghts on, it exceeds the advertised 30hrs. Oh, I also just walk away when i am done working and it just takes one key press to wake up the keyboard and connect. Near seemless reconnection. The included cable is also nice. Mesh/braided. My desk looks a lot cleaner now with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.I used a cheap $20 keyboard+mouse combo from amazon at home for a long time. At work i have the macbook pro's butterfly keys and apple's full magic keyboard. I bought the corsair mk2 rapid fire linear, but did not like the lack of actuation feedback. The cheap keyboard cannot compare at all... Mac's butterfly takes sometime to adjust. If you like it you can really fly on that keyboard. The magic keyboard has a little bit more travel than the butterfly, but I still prefer the mechanic tactile feel and media keys of this g915. The 15inch mac build has a 90 degrees hard edge finish. When i type and rest my arms, my wrist will rest on the hard edge and after a while it bothers me and leaves a mark. This is why i like wrist rests.Pros: almost everthing i said above-fast reconnecting, and swapping between bluetooth and lightspeed-very good build quality, materials, looks, layout, functionality, and useability-full rgb with Logitech GHUB software-great battery-slim, low profile-nearly best in class for everything it does-logitech ghub software is surprisingly good for keyboard customizationCons: not much, very preference based-19\"x6\". traveling with this not the best. Will not fit most desk keyboard trays. make sure you have the desk space.-The SHIFT+NUM (~!@#$%...)_+) are not backlit. They are printed on the keys.-No wrist rest... like come on even the $20 combo has a wrist wrest. The mk2 also had a wrist wrest.-price (based on your value and opinion)I felt like i need to address the 1-start review on this item that has 300+ votes complaining about the price. This is one of the few wireless (dual connection), real mechanical switches, full dedicated media keys, with macros that features great build quality with a slim profile. I literally use every feature this keyboard offers. Using only one keyboard for my work mac and gaming pc just make that $250 worth it.",
          "Overall, I really like this keyboard. This is my first mechanical keyboard that wasn't second-hand. I've always loved the low-profile chicklet-style keys, and that was the main reason I wanted this keyboard. Listed below are a few things I've noticed after using this keyboard for about a month. I purchased the G815 Tactile version. I switched over from a Razer DeathStalker Chroma.Pros:- Low profile keys.- Fairly quiet.- The overall look is good.- Very thin keyboard overall.- Very sturdy. Even when using the stands to raise the top of the keyboard, it is very stable.Cons:- In the dark, the secondary functions on the keys (such as !@#<}) are impossible to see. There is no transparency with them, so the RGB does not shine through them.- You cannot edit a specific key on the keyboard besides the G-Keys. I was expecting to be able to edit just about every key, whether it's disabling \"E,\" or changing it to a macro as an extra G-Key. With the software, you are only able to edit 6 buttons; you can edit the 5 G-Keys, and the Game Key. With my previous keyboard, I was able to disable specific keys, or change them to another key (such as changing \"E\" to \"K\"). As a note, you can disable specific keys with Game Mode, but with Game Mode, you are forced to have three keys disabled at all times.- You cannot disable the Media Keys. This is related to the con above, but I feel as if it's its own gripe.- If you depress the keys all the way, it sounds hollow, and can get fairly loud when typing at a fair pace (for me, ~75wpm).- G HUB will not open at times. For some reason, even after re-installing Windows 10, and even just re-installing the program, it does not want to open.- The Memory Profiles are terrible. I've only gotten them to work with the RGB, and have not been able to get my G-Keys to be saved to the profile. And even then, it took a bit of fumbling the first few times to actually get the profile saved and able to be loaded with another computer.- There is no way to get the RGB to look good with white. It always has a hint of blue or red, which is disappointing.Gripes with the first-time setup:- By default, the G5 key is bound to F5. This drove me absolutely mad because I couldn't figure out why the page kept refreshing when I first got this keyboard. It turns out G1-5 are bound to F1-5, respectively, out of the box.- When installing G-HUB, it automatically opens Discord so you can connect G-HUB to your Discord account. There should be a way to not have that happen, as that is annoying. This happens every time you re-install G-HUB, as well.It may seem like I have a lot more cons than pros. That is true. But to me, it *is* a keyboard, and it's good at being a keyboard. There have been some things that are user error (such as missed key strokes because I am transferring from a membrane to a mechanical keyboard). I still like the keyboard overall, but with the cons listed above\u2014particularly with G-HUB\u2014I will likely not purchase another Logitech keyboard unless those issues are addressed.",
          "So, I bought this \"brand new\" and it definitely had some crumbs on it and the packaging was open. All in all I suppose I should have just exchanged it.  However, I ended up just sticking with it as there was nothing wrong with it as the month past.  If it breaks now, that's on me I suppose.All in all a great space saver, the battery life is great, and the sound is beautiful.  While the lighting isn't the strongest out there It is still rather nice in my eyes. The white would probably provide better bounce back for lighting.All in all a wonderful product.",
          "Bought this keyboard a back in Nov 2021 and now in Jan of 2023 i have noticed that some of my keycaps broke off. These keycaps are logitech proprietary low profile keycaps and are designed with one major flaw; they have extremly weak and delicate plastic stems (feet) attaching them to the switch.This means that even after regular use, few of my keycaps stems snapped off after a year of use. I had one keycap actually break both of the little feet so it cannot be attache to the keyboard switch at all.I lowered my review to 3 stars because of how expensive the kayboard is compared to longevity.----Pros:Slim and low profile design, The battery does last a long time (weeks for me between charges.) It is nice to not have  a cable running to the keyboard. I have one charing cable for my mouse, keyboard and headphones that i alternate whenever each device needs charging. This helps me keep my desk cable free.I do not see any latency issues with gaming, ever. No hickups, no drops and no strange behavior. It just works. I do, however, keep the USB dongle plugged into my monitor which helps keep the wireless distance pretty small and has a pretty clear line of sight.I do like the extra bluetooth feature, it comes in handy if i want to quickly connect it to another device.The volume knob wheel is very smooth and i dont think i can live without it.CONS:The keycaps wiggle. I also use this keyboard for work and i noticed that the keycaps feel loose. They do not have a secure connection to the keyboards switch and you do get a loose or wobbly feel sometimes when tying.The top number row special characters do not illuminate. I knew this buying this keyboard but it is still very annoying when trying to type with low light.The Keycaps are very fragile. Do not try to take them out, or the stems will break.I knew this buying the keyboard and i was very delicate with it. However, after a year of use few of the stems have broken off.The micro-buttons are useless. you have to switch the FN keymode to use macros. unless you just progrem over you F keys. There should be an option where you just hold the FN key and push one of the F keys to use a macro but thats not how it works.",
          "I was skeptical about buying this keyboard based on the reviews I saw. I took a chance and am happy that I did. I wanted a TKL, wireless, USB/Bluetooth keyboard that is good for typing/work and gaming, has the Home/End/Pg Up/Pg Down keys in the traditional locations and also has the F keys offset (not directly above the number keys). $200 is a lot for a keyboard, but I trust Logitech and wanted to give this a try. It exceeded my expectations.I need the keyboard to be able to switch back and forth between a PC (Gaming) and a Mac (Work). On PC, I plugged in the lightspeed wireless dongle and I was done. On Mac, I paired the keyboard with bluetooth, it asked me press certain keys on the keyboard and I was done. When connected to the Mac via bluetooth, the Windows key changes to the Apple/Command key and the Alt key changes to the Option key automatically. It was seamless. I did not have to download any software or set any preferences to make this happen. I wanted to point that out because I couldn't find any other reviews that touched on that subject and this was important to know for my needs.They Keychron I was using did not have a wireless USB option, so I had to toggle back and forth between Wired USB and Bluetooth. To do so, you have to flip a switch on the side of the keyboard, then you have to flip a second switch based on if you want the keys to be Mac or PC. With the G915, all of this is gone. Its all wireless, and when you press the USB button its automatically set to PC keys...when you press the bluetooth button its automatically set to Mac keys (because I paired it with a Mac). Huge QoL improvement for me.Gaming wise...my first night I played with it, I won 6 straight in overwatch and got promoted to platinum so....take that as you will. In all seriousness though, there is no delay, no ghosting issues, no missed key presses or anything like that. It works perfectly.Typing wise, I prefer the tactile keys. The actuation point isn't super deep (like it is with Keychron) and the keys feel crisp and make a slightly audible click. I am fast and accurate. Very happy with this.The profile is suuuuper thin. So thin in fact that I don't need my wrist rest anymore. The Keychron I had was incredibly thick and without a wrist guard, it felt like my wrists were constantly angled up. Not the case with this keyboard.I don't care about lights but.....it has them, and there are several options available in the G-Hub software.On the negatives, the keys aren't as tight as I am used to. They wiggle around kind of like a loose tooth might. It's not a huge deal, but its something I noticed that I thought was weird.The price is going to be the biggest negative for me. Paying $200 for a keyboard is unattractive, but since it covered all of my (weird) bases, I paid it. Wish it was close to $150.Overall, it fit my needs, performs better than expected and it cleaned up my setup quite a bit. Happy with the purchase, even if it was pricey.",
          "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n",
          "At $250 it is by far the most expensive keyboard i have ever purchased. Previously my most expensive keyboard was the Logitech G513 at $150.I bought this keyboard (alongside the Logitech G604 Mouse) to use at work, I have two computers that i switch between and the idea of using a single keyboard for both of them was what pushed me to make the purchase.Main computer: Dell Latitude 5490.Second Computer: Microsoft Surface Book 2 15\" (Connected via Bluetooth)I'd like to start with the bad before I get into what I like about the keyboard.The Bad:- The Logitech G Hub software is a PAIN to install on a company issued computer locked down by firewalls and IT. If I hadn't been in IT myself I doubt i would have ever gotten it installed. The software installer package when being run requires additional files to be downloaded in the background, this got blocked by my company firewall. I have the software installed on my Home PC without issue, but the software still is bloated and buggy.- The shift values on the keyboard are printed below the non-shift values. For a screenshot see the (as of this posting) the third image for the product that shows the middle of the keyboard and says 'Lightspeed Wireless' View the ? and / keys to the left of shift. Normally, on most keyboards I have used, the Shift value ? is printed above the non-shift value /. My other Logitech G513 keyboard has the ? above the /, so this change isn't consistent across Logitech products.- When swapping between Bluetooth/Lightspeed my RGB settings are lost, they can be reset by either turning on and off the keyboard or going back into the software to reapply them.- After toggling between Bluetooth/Lightspeed, the Logitech G Hub software removes the ability to use and change the G1-G5 keys. They are non-functional and the option to do anything with them is lost in the software. Toggling the power to the keyboard resolves this.- It reports that it has 0% battery life to my Bluetooth connected device, the G Hub software shows it at 99% but windows will occasionally inform me that the laptop is out of battery.- It is still using Micro-USB and does not have a USB-C port.- the M1,M2,M3,MR, Lightspeed, Bluetooth, GameMode soft buttons at the top are not RGB, they are as far as I can tell fixed colors. They have the technology as the exactly same styled RGB softbutton next to GameMode is a pleasantly configurable RGB.- The Logitech G Hub software does not detect or let you configure the device on the Bluetooth connected computer. (This functionality is built into the G604 mouse so it is possible.)A lot of these problems are software and can and *better* be fixed in an update to the Logitech G Hub software and firmware updates.Things I like about the keyboard:- Toggling between Bluetooth/Lightspeed is genuinely immediate. By the time my hand returns to home-row after hitting the key it is usable on the other device.- There is no input lag detectable on lightspeed, There is no input lag detectable over bluetooth (my G604 mouse does, but this review is not about that product)- Fun fact: You can technically use it on 3 devices: When on 'lightspeed' connection, it will first default to the USB connection if there is one. So you could have one computer wired to the keyboard, unplug the wire and have a second computer connected via Lightspeed, and then toggle to a third computer with the Bluetooth key. If you are considering going this route I would recommend grabbing a Magnetic cable for quick plugging in and unplugging of the keyboard. (I have some NetDot Gen 12 cables that support data)- I have the Tactile variant of the keys (Brown switches), Since i'm in an office enviroment keeping the loudness of my typing down was ideal, so i avoided the 'Clicky' variant, the Tactile keys feel good to the touch. They make good sounds (My G513 had a springy tang to the sound while it was being broken in, not too pleasant to hear)- I'm sure the battery life is good, 30 hours is 4x more than I need on a standard work-day. the Software tells me that it can last up to 60 hours, which is 2x more than the advertised length. I doubt i'll ever need to test the battery, but it's good knowing that if i do need to rely on keyboard battery, that it will last me many days of use.- It's really thin, and it feels strong and durable. it barely fits into my backpack with my laptop, im not worried that if my backpack falls or gets stepped on that the keyboard will break.- It feels light to hold and carry, but it is 'heavy' for how thin it is. Despite how light it is, it sits steady and immovable on my desk.- I'm in love with the volume scroll wheel.This is a good keyboard. The lost star is not because of the software issues, which I hope will be fixed soon and not be relevant to anyone who may read this fairly long review. I also did not remove a star because of price. I felt it was worth it for me but also irrelevant to the quality of the product.It lost the star because of:- 7 buttons do not have RGB- Still using Micro USB instead of USB C- The Key Printing issue",
          "I did a lot of research on the best wireless mechanical keyboard and so many respected hardware sites (Tom's Hardware, Techradar) list this option as their top pick. They are not wrong. I've had this keyboard for a bit more than a month and after some initial break in, the keyboard lives up to the hype.The programmable lighting is really nice. I'm not a big fan of the crazy RGB gamer aesthetic but even I was suckered into creating a cool (if monochromatic) wavey light pattern. The G-Hub software isn't super user-friendly, but it gets the job done.The mechanical keys feel really good so far. There was an initial break in period over the first few days where the keys felt a bit inconsistent from one to another, but now they all feel really smooth and consistent. I went with the linear option and I like how quiet and responsive they are.  I was unsure if I was going to like transitioning from a full actuation \"clicky\" board to this one with the shortened key press distance and the linear switch, but I'm very happy with it. I should call out the keys are untextured and  totally smooth, almost slippery feeling for the first few uses. It was very off-putting at first but either I got used to it or the keys caps have broken in and it feels fine now.I'm not a big macro user normally, but I've created a few for work to speed up simple tasks that I do all the time like switch to outlook and create a new message. Not super helpful, but it feels cool to do.The  build quality is amazing. I've already shared my thoughts on the key caps and switches, but the board itself is a very nice anodized brushed aluminum. It's a small thing, but it looks great, makes the board rigid even though it's very thin and lends a nice heft that \"cheaper feeling\" boards don't have. The fit and finish is also top notch. There aren't any weird gaps where the pieces fit together and all the edges are very tight. The media keys are OK -they aren't mechanical and can feel a bit squishy. The volume bar is knurled aluminum and feels great.The battery life is spot on. I get slightly more than 30 hours on a charge with lighting active. The lightspeed wireless and bluetooth connectivity are easy to pair and I haven't had an issue.My only complaints about this board are about the form factor and the media/profile/lighting keys. The keyboard is a non-standard length due to the addition of the macro keys. This makes it impossible to find a wrist rest or lap board that fits flush to the length of the board.  Logitech should definitely make a wrist rest for this board. You can find custom options on sites like Etsy, but they are 2-3x the price of mass produced ones. The other issue are the keys used for media controls/keyboard profile switching/etc (the round buttons in the images). They don't feel mechanical and feel pretty squishy. I would have preferred all mechanical keys, but I don't use them nearly as much as the rest of the keyboard so it's not a deal breaker.Overall, this board is super expensive - but you are getting what you pay for with well made components and features that you can't find anywhere else. I have concerns about long term durability of the key cap coating (I hear it wears off with heavy use over time and they are a custom format, not easily replaceable) and the battery life. I expect this board to perform well for several years based on the price and initial impressions and will update this review if any long term issues come up.",
          "Saw a demo G815 with the clicky keys. Enjoyed it and found here for $50 off. Swapped from a HyperX keyboard to this one and I enjoyed the slim feel of the keys.The part that makes it a 4 star for my tastes is the first impression of having a extra row of keys to the left of the keyboard which makes is harder for me to recenter onto WASD or QWER for my games, this opinion may change after longer use (I\u2019ve had it for 10 hours of gaming so far). The keys are also far lighter so I have mistyped more than a few times just from my standard resting position.Overall, very easy to setup the software, very satisfying clicks, and more comfortable on my desk with it being more slim. Would certainly recommend to a friend.",
          "First up, build quality is good. It feels really nice, and I'm LOVING the low profile mechanical keys. I'm bummed it doesn't have a case because it may just wind up commuting with me to work. As a keyboard I REALLY like it. The keys are dished rather than flat like some competitiors, and that is a really nice feel. Ergonomically it is really working for me.Also the Bluetooth connects REALLY fast. Impressively so. The lightspeed connection so far has been indistinguishable for me in gaming. Which may mean nothing as I don't really play competitive, twitchy online games much anymore. Yes the keyboard feels like a wired keyboard and that's better than old bluetooth keyboards I have had in the past, but that describes both bluetooth and lightspeed.In short I'm pretty hooked on this thing which has it's down side given the premium price.OK, but I gave it three stars... why?1) It's over $200 and while it feels nice, it's basically a plastic chassis with a metal base plate and some metal or metalized plastic cladding on top. There is a well regarded similar style wireless keyboard for basically $80 that lines up pretty similar in materials.2) There are other bluetooth boards out there with very similar build for about $80. You are paying a more than $140 premium for lightspeed and color customization. Even worse, that $80 keyboard supports being paired to three devices. This supports 1 bluetooth connection and 1 lightspeed connection.3) I mentioned color customization in #2 there, and that is where this is supposed to shine and can fall on its face.  If this feature is worth money to you, you clearly want the lighting to work how YOU want it to. And it doesn't unless you only use it via lightspeed or wired. You do that and you have all sorts of control of layout, lighting, what it does unde low battery, etc. It's pretty sweet and not to hard to get the hang of using it.BUT...If you set it up how you want and go to bluetooth mode, poof it's gone. It does what it wants. Which is not great if you are allergic to RGB clown vomit like I am.Now initially after reading up on it prior to purchase I thought Iw ould be able to set it up to say be all red when on my gaming machine via lightspeed, and all green when connected via bluetooth to my laptop. It just doesn't do that. It's not aware of the state of the connection and thus you cant do that and set up a bluetooth default and lightspeed default. But I didn't much care because the same reviews that implied you could also failed ot mention that the mode buttons are illuminated and make it really obvious.You cna control modes form teh keyboard by holding the illumination button and pressing 0-1. 8 and 9 you can set yourself. So hey.. I can jsut set 8 to be green and 9 to be red and pick which one I want on demand. No biggie, right? Wrong. See that works like you expect in lightspeed more. In bluetooth mode, no.. when you idle enough to trigger the idle mode, it engages the idle mode from the factory. Not the one you set up via lightspeed and the app. This is basically breathing, dimming blue. And when you start typing it goes back to the right color though, right? NO! it goes back to factory default mode, solid bright blue. Paused to read an email for thirty second? Your board is back to blue mode and screw you that's why.Ok, this can't be right so I poke around more. What you can do is use the on board storage. If I do that AND configure 8 and 9 to be things I like in bluetooth mode I CAN get teh following behavior. lets say 8 is green and 9 is red. I go to bluetooth, and it stays in whatever mode I was in in lighting. If I hit brightness-8 it is now my custom all green setting. It idles and it goes breathing dimmed blue, BUT if I start typing again it goes back to my custom green setting. I can live with this.However, you know when I said light speed mode was perfect? Yeah.. when you tuern on on board memory, it is not perfect. That disables your control of idle and low power lighting configs. It too will no go to dim blue breathing mode when idle.I can live with this because that wasn't a killer feature for me, but It's a $200+ keyboard it'd be nice if it worked well, and that could be a killer feature for YOU.If anyone can tell me I'm just missing the right way to do it, I'll gladly update my review and bump it at least one star.ETA: Having lived with this keyboard for a while now, I still like. One non-obvious good thing I have come to appreciate is that it has an off switch. This makes regularly cleaning it much easier than with your typical wired keyboard or wireless keyboard with no off switch.",
          "full size",
          "This is my first ever mechanical keyboard I have spent significant money on. With that saidPros:- Lightweight, yet keyboard feet keep it from sliding across the desk. Speaking of, the feet are very nice, and get a solid angle for typing- Switches: Logitech switches are very nice (I got Linear switch model). Switches are a bit louder than I had anticipated, but are smooth, no issues of debouncing or misinputs (you can tell when key is pressed or not, never misstype again!). The removal of misinputs or misstyping is super nice for software development; things like VIM commands and REGEX can get all messed up by one extra character you didnt see.- Keystroke press force: Force to press key down is firm, but is solid, and gives tactile feedback on press.- LEDS: Lights have tons of cool features, and Logitech G Suite opens up light controller to your desire. Would love to see Logitech add an API for lighting controller. Would be super cool!- Accessory buttons: Macro keys are not inconvenient, I have seen many comments about hitting G5 in attempt to hit control. This has happened 1 time, but I mean 1 time in a week of typing really isnt that bad. There are 15 macro keys (5 * 3 profiles), and scripts can be written to run from any macro which is super cool (Say you wanted a key to open ETrade or Robinhood, you can do that). Volume knob is extremely big, easy to get to, without accidentally pressing it above the numpad. Very high quality metallic volume knob. Profile buttons, quick macro button, gamer mode, brightness, and media control buttons all very nice with conditioned rubber tops for premium feel.Cons:- Accessory buttons: Actual switching element of ACCESSORY BUTTONS (NOT KEYBOARD KEYS) is a little iffy. Does not give nice responsive press, which can be gotten from buttons as cheap as 0.10$, kind of a bummer.- Caps / Num Lock / Profile button LEDS: Non customizable white LED. Not ugly, but doesnt go with the theme. Same with the Profile Buttons, except they're yellow, not white.- BIGGEST CON: No backlight on the symbols. These are extremely important for software development, doing things like: Python comments, Perl/Bash scripting, C/C++ programming, anything with high dependency on symbol input, is fairly annoying to do at night with this keyboard. Obviously you can remember which symbol is associated with each number (The numbers are lit), but this is a pain in the arse, and for 170$ it shouldn't be a problem.Overall, that's my opinion on the keyboard. Its not bad by any means, but I can see why some people are let down. Build quality is superb, packaging is a bit lacking (I can see how people might need RND), appeal is as nice as pictures, and actual keyboard functionality gets 8/10. Changing profile LEDS and caps/num lock LEDS to be RGB, and inclusion of backlit symbols give this keyboard a 10/10.Cumulative Rating: 8.8/10.",
          "Needed to get a new keyboard after my previous one started double clicking and this one intrigued me quite a bit. I wanted to find a wireless tkl model that also had dedicated media buttons and this one fit that bill. I was initially a little hesitant due to the high price but decided to go with it anyways. I am very glad that I did, as it is the best keyboard I have ever used for sure. Now I have not used a huge variety of them, probably around 5-6 over the last 7 or so years, but I was still impressed at how much I enjoyed using it. Here's how I feel it fares in a few categories -Connectivity :I haven it had any connection issues when using the keyboard with its included wireless dongle. While I have not made use of the integrated bluetooth, it is a nice to have that I may in the future. The keyboard mostly stays right on my desk at all times so Im not entirely sure what kind of range you will have with the wireless but, based on my experience with other Logitech light speed devices, I would imagine it will suffice even if your use case places it further away from the machine its connected to. The keyboard uses micro usb for charging and wired connections. Which felt a little underwhelming given the high price point, even if the keyboard has been out for a few years now, but all of my other peripherals are still micro usb as of now so it was convenient for me. Though I don't swap keyboards as often as my headset or mouse so usb c would have been nice as far as future proofing goes.Battery Life :Battery life is typically one of the biggest drawbacks when switching to wireless peripherals but Ive been pleasantly surprised so far. Not only is it a keyboard, which means operating it in wired mode isn't as annoying as with a mouse or headset when charging, but the battery will last a fair amount of time as well. The keyboard has a fairly aggressive sleep timer by default which allows it to last for around a week at minimum even when I am using my pc regularly. The sleep timer will not shut off while typing or anything but it will likely sleep if you are watching even shorter videos. Which is no problem for me as I like the superior battery life gained from this and the keyboard is very quick to wake, so you can pick right back up. The battery life I have achieved is also with rgb on, so the outlook may be even better for you if rgb is something you keep off.Typing Experience :This keyboard is my absolute favorite to type on. The keys have plenty of travel and I actually prefer the low profile switches used here compared to the typical profile of a gaming keyboard. On top of that, I also generally prefer clicky mechanical switches so the blues used here are perfect for me, but obviously that is subjective. I switch between a few different computers regularly for one reason or another and I easily get back up to my full typing speed on this keyboard. One caveat to this, though, is that due to the low profile switches the key stabilization could be a touch better. It's not terrible, and the space bar feels fine, but overall the keys do wobble a bit more than I typically like. I also use Caps Lock quite often and much prefer having a dedicated light to let me know that its on/off versus the changed in the key backlight some keyboards use. As far as the media buttons go, though, the school wheel feels nice but the other buttons feel a little mushy and too sensitive to press. They're far enough away from the main keys so I don't misclick on them but they can be pressed from any angle and just have very little tactility. Not a dealbreaker but figured it was worth mentioning.Software :Logitechs G Hub software is one of the better peripheral software suites out there in my opinion. it seems to be relatively lightweight, and I have not run into bugs or issues as often as I have with the software offered by Razer and Corsair. I have not done too much customization of the keyboard with the software, however, so I can't really elaborate how effective it may be for a power user in this regard.Closing thoughts:Overall, this keyboard is amazing. I love typing on it, and the wireless does provide more benefit than it does cons for me personally. The lack of usb type c and the lackluster media keys are really the only drawbacks I can think of and neither are dealbreaking issues to me. The main area of contention would have to be the price. It could be difficult to justify the price especially if wireless seems a needless feature for what you are looking for. Which makes be a little sad that there is not a wired version of this keyboard. The typing experience is so excellent that a wired version of this keyboard for around the $100 to even $150 mark would be an easy recommendation in my opinion. There is also the fact that I believe Razer is releasing their own low profile keyboard that would compete with this. Given its far newer, it may rectify those 2 drawbacks with this keyboard so pricing will definitely be an important factor. Though, again, I prefer Logitechs software, and I have not had great battery life on Razer devices so we'll have to see. In any case, this keyboard is still a great option, especially if you find it on sale.",
          "I promised myself a great keyboard to go with my new computer. Over many years Logitech has not disappointed so I focused on them. This keyboard was the one for several reasons.Years ago I had a wired one similar to this one with a roller volume control. That was a large deciding factor. The lighted keys are nice. One negative is special symbols do not light up. Not crucial but would have been niceThe charge lasts forever. The wireless is nice, my old one was wired, so much nicer with no cords. This is a good example of you get what you pay for. Highly recommended.",
          "TLDR: great keyboard but not worth the money. I\u2019m this essay I will\u2026First off, I love the keyboard. The response time is great, rgb is bright (if you\u2019re into that) and the Logitech hub isn\u2019t a terrible piece of bloatware.If you\u2019re looking for a wireless gaming keyboard you could do far worse. I\u2019ve had no latency using logitechs wireless hub but haven\u2019t bothered with blue tooth. I use this keyboard exclusively for my gaming set up though. The key caps are cheap for a 200+$ keyboard. It\u2019s extremely low profile which I find to be awful for typing in a work type setting but for gaming it\u2019s fine. The battery lasts forever even with full rgb on. They went cheap with a micro usb charger but I can\u2019t tell you the difference other than convenience this makes on charging. USB c would be preferred since it is the standard now but here we are. Thankfully if you have the Logitech gpro mouse which I assume Logitech buyers might for a gaming set up you can use one plug to charge both (not at the same time obviously).It goes to sleep fast but wakes up faster than my wireless keychron k4 I use for work which is really nice.Like everyone else my complaint is the price. I\u2019d the keyboard was 150 I would have gladly paid that without feeling bad but 200+ is a big ask and makes me have buyers remorse on what would be a great keyboard. The key caps are cheap too but I\u2019m not big on that kind of thing. The keyboard is solid but keep in mind it is very thin and so ergonomically isn\u2019t great if you\u2019re someone who likes their keyboard elevated.On prime day this was on sale for 160$ which I missed sadly. If you can wait for that sale again I would do that because as I said, at 150 im happy at 200$ im second guessing my purchase.",

          "Not as bright as the last keyboard I had, which I can get by, took a little getting used to but that was all. Overall the keyboard is so nice, being able to go wireless is so nice especially when I draw with my wacom tablet because I can still reach the keyboard no matter where the tablet is. My probably only complaint is that I can't see the alt keys so I am having to learn where like the & and * are better, but thats just a 'i switch from a keyboard that showed those to one that doesn't' so its a me problem lol.I wish it was a little quieter, as someone whos mic likes to pick up all the clicking and furiously quickly types, its annoying for my friends at times.I will say cleaning this is so much better than the corsair I had before, I have 5 cats and the amount of cat hair under my keys at times... -shudder- Don't have to worry about that now.",
          "I love this keyboard, i love led, but why in the hell are none of the secondary characters like under the numbers lit up? the numbers are lit up but not the characters they share a key with? you go through all the trouble to light the key up but leave them out? whats the point of going LED if your not going to light everything. At first i didnt think it would bother me but when i got the lights off in my room you cant even see the secondary keys. i just think that was massively overlooked. Your already lighting up the character on the same key so why not do the entire key? its actually really annoying, i love the keyboard otherwise but i just have to say that makes absolutely no sense to me if your going through the trouble of making a light keyboard but leave those important symbols out. my old logitech didnt have that issue i didnt even think it was something i had to worry about buying a LED keyboard. Anyway buyers beware if you are on your computer in a dim or dark room you will have serious trouble seeing the secondary characters.",
          "The secondary characters don't light up! This is a terrible design flaw that I don't understand and it drives me crazy. I absolutely love the feel of these low profile, tactile keys. However, the lack of fully lit keys and the G keys, which are unnecessary and get in the way, made me swap this keyboard out for a corsair k70. Logitech, if you read this, please make an updated version of this keyboard without the g keys and better lighting!",

          "Update :  I originally said you could not assign colors to individual keys.  Not true.  In the G-Hub software there is a tab called \"Free Style\" where you can set any key or group of keys to any color you like.  Perhaps they should include a _complete_ tutorial with the software.  I only found out because I googled what that tab does.I initially purchased the G915 (full size version) Tactile.  HUGE (no pun intended) mistake.  I have always had full size keyboards and had no issue. But the G915 is larger than normal.  My mouse was constantly hitting the right side of the keyboard and the  G5 key by accident when muscle memory was going for the CTRL key.  So I returned it and got the G915 TKL.  Nice.Overall both have the same pluses.  The keys are bright and smooth.  It's actually fun to type on these keyboards because the switches are so silky smooth.  It's true the special symbols on the numeric keys don't light, but seriously, how often is that a problem.  I use $ and * all the time so I already know they are on the 4 and 8 keys.  It's not really a problem.  I have also read some reviews that don't like the volume knob-bar.  I don't get it.  It turns the volume up, and it turns it down.  What's the issue?The charge time to 100% is 30 mins - 1 hour while using it.  And the charge lasts for days.  What I really like is the backlights have auto-off to save battery when you haven't hit a key in a minute or so.  Then as soon as you touch a key, they all come back on.  This can be turned off or on through the G app.It's true, you can't set each key or key group individually.  For me, it would be nice but it's not a deal killer.And the best part, and the main reason I bought these, is you can switch between bluetooth and lighting with the press of a button.  I connect to my work laptop with bluetooth, my desktop with lighting.  And when you switch it's instant. No waiting for a handshake.  Goodbye usb switch!  Dig it!Overall I am very happy with these keyboards.  If I could change anything about them it would be :1. USB C on the charging port (it is 2022 afterall)2. Individual key color assignments3. Did I already mention USB C?4. A USB Passthrough port",

The most expensive ones are less than $200, which were Corsair\u2019s and Roccat\u2019s creme de la crop keyboards (and this was 2013 when high prices were more acceptable). I replaced them all with these cheap low-profile mech keyboards because these are subjectively better. Yes, these are wired, but the price difference between these and the G915 is a joke \u2014 considering these are better in many ways as well (like the keycaps).Even the\u00a0",
          "Got this because I use a computer professionally and thought it looked SO cool. Keys feel great and I can type very fast. It's not loud.

Very comfortable and I expect it to last forever like every Logitech thing.It's nice having a fast connection to the computer for speedy typing, and it never misses any key presses. Other wireless keyboards I've had (MS Ergonomic) do sometimes miss things if you're going fast. And there is a tiny delay I don't like from growing up hardwired.Battery lasts forever, but the app keeps bothering me to recharge it as soon as it gets to 15%, which will last me an entire week.Seems durable and repairable. There are replacement keycaps available if you google for them.I got the \"matching\" G502X mouse as well, and it is a little odd that the keyboard and mouse use different charging connectors.",
          "I mean, this has to be the best keyboard ever made. Like, ever. It does so much, while also being extremely simple. It's beautiful, it's sleek, it's lightweight, it's wireless, it's quiet (linear version at least). Minimalist but also loaded with features and customization. Did I mention how light it is? Unbelievable battery life, probably have to charge it once a week or so, just plug it in overnight when I go to bed.  Climate change friendly? Not entirely sure what that even means but, sounds good to me!Also I'm fairly sure this keyboard is either magical or has some sort of secret AI, because I swear keystrokes I used to miss or struggle with just beautifully and naturally fall into place now. It's like it just knows where my fingers are going to go, or somehow guides them to the right place. The keyboard itself made me a faster and more accurate typist. Amazing!It is pricey, but I expect this keyboard to last me a very, very long time. I've never met its equal, maybe there's some secret amazing find cheaper third party option floating around somewhere that's just as good (I did try one, it was awful), but, for over 10 years now Logitech has always done me right, and, at least for me, their quality of product always stands the test of time and I've never regretted a single Logi purchase. Before this my G910 was the best keyboard, and I stand by my assertion the G602 is one of the best gaming mouses out there. I've never denied I'm a bit I'm a Logitech fanboy. For a reason. For reasons. I can now add the G915 to that list of reasons.I wouldn't have minded some sort of palm rest or palm rest option. Even if you had to buy it separately and attach it as an accessory...but like I said, they were going for minimalist, and so that was one thing that had to go. I'm not going to detract points because it's not a huge deal and most people don't want a palm rest, though they are good for helping to quickly pick up a keyboard without bumping the spacebar or something...but again, not a big deal, just being nitpicky. I have a memory foam palm rest that is perfectly sufficient and fantastically comfortable compared to any plastic one I've ever used.Get this keyboard. It's worth it, I promise.",

Logitech was once a good brand, that went the way of the Apple and Razer when it comes to premium prices, but does not have the materials and parts to back it up. Essentially, your money is going to their marketing department. I do not want to pay for their marketing. I want to pay for MY keyboard.I use my keyboards for everything. Gaming, working (lots of coding), browsing, everything. I am a power user. This keyboard does not deliver based on the price.- - -NOTES\u207d\u207f\u00b9\u207e In 2020, or 2018 even, Micro-USB is cheap, stupid, and unacceptable. It tells a LOT about a company when they choose this old technology over the more modern USB-C. My main issue with Micro USB is its fragility. The port breaks more easily. When it does, your device is BRICK. I've broken a lot of devices this way. (To avoid this problem, I\u2019ve since used magnetic micro-USB cables\u00a0",
          "The keyboard itself is great. The keys feel nice to type with, and the linear model that I got is so much quieter than the other versions. The keys are responsive and snappy. The only gripes I have are minor, but they're worth pointing out anyway. I wish it could get a little brighter. And the letters on the keys can be hard to see when no lights are on at all, though they're never really off to begin with. Though, at the same time, the Num Lock and Caps Lock indicators are too bright. Still not really a big issue though. It has a number pad, which is a big plus. Two little kickstands prop it up a little, but it's not too much of a height difference.G Hub is a terrible software, and it's mind-boggling how buggy it still is even after all these years. Sometimes it'll only open after a new install. So I would recommend saving your color and lighting layouts locally on the device so you never have to deal with G Hub again. But if you have no issues with the software (unlike me and many others) then this too can be considered a nonissue.Overall still an incredible keyboard. It had better be, for that price.",

Well worth my money but is it worth it to you? Read on.So, things I like:- Super thin but heavy enough not to move around at all. Stable as a rock.- Fast. Like really, noticeably faster. My typing speed instantly increased.- Butter smooth linear keystrokes, no muss, no fuss, no click.- Metal body looks and feels pro, top quality. It should for the price.- A bit of space between the keys means less fat fingering.- Really, super programmable per key. For example I have just the logo to do a lighting effect while the other keys are static.- The G HUB program that sets up the lights and macros was intuitive enough I figured out how to use it just tinkering with it. I was able to do a lot of interesting configuration on my KB.- I set up my keys with colors to denote function. So most keys are white but my F keys are yellow, my G keys are orange, my Windows and audio keys are blue, my caps, num, scrlk, pause, prtsc keys are green, etc. Makes for at a glance and peripheral identification and less hitting the wrong key.- A small lighted bar on the spacebar.  Nice touch.- Stout cord and rubber protector. Braided cover. Built to last. Handsome IMO. YMMV- Audio controls are simple and responsive.- Separate programmable/macro keys (G keys). Sure, they could have built another function into the F keys but having them separate means one touch activation. When gaming simple is best. The biggest argument I see against separate G keys is a larger KB footprint. But not here. My old Azio KB without those measures about 18\u00bc\" (46cm) across while this one is about 18\u00bd\" (47cm) so \u00bc\" (1cm) difference. My standard HP keyboard for work is 18\" (just under 46cm) across so the difference even there is minimal. Unless you are upgrading from a KB with no number pad this just isn't an issue. They accomplish this by having a much narrower bezel between the edge of the keys and the edge of the KB. Clever design.- I thought I would miss the built in wrist rest but I don't. With this much thinner KB it just isn't needed. And that change means a smaller footprint front to back. Under 6\" (14cm).Things I found odd:- Needs TWO USB plugs. One with a KB symbol, the other with a USB symbol. Why 2? Power requirements? Not a big deal but it's weird. [EDIT: The extra plug is to make the USB port on the top of the KB is a passthrough. But it's USB 2.0 and a KB is not a lot of traffic so why they thought a passthrough was needed I don't know. Still weird.]- The USB passthrough is next to the cord on the top edge of the KB, not on the side as expected.- No scroll lock light. It has a scrlk KEY but no indicator light. Not that most of us use that but if you ever turned it on by accident you would have a heck of a time figuring it out.- There is no audio passthrough. I don't care but you might.- The keys use the new style of being raised up off the keyboard so there is empty space under them. It looks kinda cool but I worry I will catch the corner of an edge key and pop it off. IDK if that would break it or just pop off the top. I would rather not find out.Stuff I don't like:- The symbols !@#$%^&*()_+ etc are just printed on the keys; they do NOT illuminate. So on the 1 key only the 1 lights up, NOT the !  And they are printed in a medium gray, not white, so they really don't stand out. In low light --- like for gaming -- they are completely invisible. This is the only thing I truly HATE about this keyboard.  I'm sure someone will point out that I should be able to type without looking but then why illuminate the keys at all? And esp with symbols their placement changes from KB to KB. Any way you look at it, this is a big FAIL.- The letters and numbers on the keys are small. They could have easily been 25% larger without looking oversized and still with plenty of room for the symbols And they should have. They are very clear so even my old eyes can make them out but bigger would have been better.- I have yet to figure out how to use the 3 memory keys. I've tried a number of things and nothing has worked yet. The manual, being for the G810 which did not have those keys, is no help. I have found no YouTube vids on how to do it. I'll figure it out but this is a problem.- Speaking of the manual, the closest I could find was the G810 manual and this is a complete redesign so not much help there.- The web site was weird and buggy and had no idea what a G815 is. It said something about being in transition so maybe that's it. But wow, just wow.- The caps lock and num lock lights are white, rather bright, and not adjustable. I will have to put a tinted plastic cover over them. Also, reading the printed text next to them to see which is caps and which is num is impossible. Litreally black on black. I can figure it out but that's obnoxious. Maybe I'll paint over that in white.- The brightest level is just about right for me, but I like lower light. It has dimmer levels but nothing brighter. Not sure why they went with such subdued light, especially since this is a USB plug in, not wireless, so no battery issues. If I had a fancy PC build on display with this KB doing a light show I would want it much brighter.The problems are mostly things that should have been caught by releasing a few prototypes to a handful of gamers. Overall it's a fantastic keyboard with some surprising issues for a premium priced KB. I don't regret the purchase but normally with this many issues I might give it just 3 stars. Still, it's already by far my all time favorite KB so I'll go with 4.And hey, Logitech, if you're reading this, if you need someone to tell you this stuff in the future I would be happy to do so. Because whoever is doing it now is not catching these things.",
          "I had been researching mechanical keyboards for almost 3 years, ordering testers to figure out what switches I preferred, and getting nowhere. Too much analysis paralysis, overthinking everything, not finding exactly what I wanted. A friend told me about this one and I just decided to just buy it. I'm so, so glad I did. It's fairly inexpensive for a mechanical setup, but the overall quality is such good value for the price point, not to mention all the features you get compared to other keyboards.The low profile is perfect for me. One of my big issues with testers is I like a bit of resistance so I don't hit keys incorrectly, but the full size keys have a really long travel distance, making me feel like I'd quickly tire of typing. The clickiness is about on par with a Cherry MX Blue, but is a bit higher pitched and not quite as \"full\" sounding. Enough to give you lots of tactile feedback and make others know you're getting work done, without resonating as much across your workspace.Having the logitech brand and software behind it is a really good thing too, compared to using a smaller company or going your own way with a custom build. There are programmable keys, media keys, and a volume knob that gives you all the modern keyboard functionality you want without sacrificing the mechanical feel. While the G Hub software is not the most intuitive, I was able to quickly set the programmable G keys up with macros in my most-used software, saving me lots of multi-keystroke stuff (for example in Visual Studio I set it up to run the formatter, save, and compile the open document all in one key press).While I don't do much gaming, it's very responsive for that. My only complaint there is the space bar seems to have a different switch activation point than the other keys, but you can easily adjust to it. I honestly might play more games now that I'm not using a \"squishy\" keyboard that causes too many errors.The RGB is a pleasant surprise for me. Not really big on that kind of stuff and expected I'd just throw on a solid backlight and be done, but it's interesting to have programmable RGB. For games, you can set custom key highlighting for particular game controls you want in different colors (e.g. WASD red, push-to-talk orange, something else blue, etc.). There's some cool animated modes, but my favorite for office work is simply changing colors of the keys last pressed. It's one of those features you don't exactly think you'd like so much until you have it.I can't judge battery life or wireless functionality since I have only used it in wired mode so far, which is a straightforward USB connection. It's nice that I'll be able to quickly use it for travel by having the wireless dongle available though, and my friend said the battery life can be up to a few days (chargeable from the same USB connection).Overall this is one of my favorite purchases in a long time because it's made typing enjoyable. As a programmer, I feel this one purchase has already improved my productivity and made me generally happier to do my work. My only regret is not doing this sooner and living with a sub-par keyboard so long.",
          "Clean finish, very smooth (way quieter than traditional mechanical) key strokes that have strong feedback, and the battery lasts FOREVER (first charge lasted about 3 weeks). Only drawback so far is the G1-5 keys on the left because I keep overshooting the ctrl and escape button.",
          "Is it expensive? Yes, but for some people it's worth it, for others it's not. That's up to you to decide for yourself, but price aside, I'll just tell you about the keyboard.The G915 works really well for me. I got the linear version and the key presses are much quieter than the G513 linear keys, which weren't really loud to begin with. I play a lot of Overwatch, so I hit the keys hard when I play. My gf can tell  a difference in the noise when I play.The media controls are a good feature. The volume knob is a smooth scroll. For some reason I assumed it would be clicky/notchy, but it's not. The G513 had to use a Fn button to access the media controls, which was a little annoying.  Also you can't customize the colors of the media/memory/other special function keys at the top. Kinda lame.Not a big deal, but I like the light up G in the upper left corner. Matches my mouse and mouse pad.I wasn't specifically looking for a slim mechanical keyboard, but this keyboard had all the features I wanted. It turns out that I do enjoy the feel of typing on it. The key travel doesn't feel too short (like the new MacBook keyboards). I also appreciate how heavy and sturdy the base is. Also, because the base is so thin, I don't feel like I need a wrist rest anymore (the G513 came with a really cushy one, which I loved). Dimitri from Hardware Canucks said you wouldn't need a wrist rest, and I agree. My keyboard sits on my super oversized mouse mat. The mouse mat serves as a soft place for my wrists while I type, in the same way that I lay my wrist on it when I use the mouse.I also do like the G keys on the left side of the keyboard. Now the new G Hub software is buggy, not too intuitive, and lacks some features when compared to the Logitech Gaming Software. But I was able to map one of the G keys to cycle through my different audio outputs. It makes it easy for when I want to switch between my speakers and headset which are always physically connected to my PC. The old way I used to switch audio outputs was by right clicking on the speaker icon in the taskbar. Just another small convenience. The one thing I don't like about the G keys though is my left pinky naturally gravitates towards the G5 key (the lower left most key) when I try to use the Ctrl key. I'm assuming I'll get used to the layout over time, but right now it's a bit hard retraining myself. Btw, on the plus side for the new G Hub software , it does give a bit more control on custom lighting for your logitech devices. It's not great and definitely not as good as Corsair's software and level of customization though.I bought the wireless version. Now I don't plan on using it wirelessly so it's always plugged in, but the reason I wanted it is because there's a button which can quickly switch the keyboard to bluetooth mode. I have it paired with my phone so when I get a text on my phone, I just hit the bluetooth key on the keyboard and quickly type a text message. (Just to be clear, I'm still looking at my phone while I'm typing -- I'm just using the keyboard to type.) Then I quickly switch back to continue using my computer. It's a nice convenience.One thing that I don't like about the keyboard is that the symbols are not backlit on the top row number keys (and other keys). Maybe they do it for aesthetics, but sometimes I miss that feature when I'm typing in a dark room.All in all, I'm pretty happy. It was definitely expensive, but for me, it does a lot of the things I want it to do and that was important to me.Btw, in case you didn't notice, the wired version of this keyboard has a USB passthrough, which the wireless version doesn't have. Just in case you wanted that feature.",
          "I\u2019m using the 815 so I don\u2019t have to worry about the battery, and I\u2019ve been using it for 2 years now.  Also I\u2019m a hard core PC gamer (FPS mostly) so that\u2019s my primary use.  I build my own PCs so G Hub was easy for me to figure out.Now that you know how long I\u2019ve used it for before writing a review, what I use it for and my comfort level I will give my impressions.  In short out of all the keyboards I\u2019ve used (too numerous to recollect\u2026 especially if I factor work into the equation) it is not only my favorite it is by far my favorite.It\u2019s not perfect by any means. I wish the secondary keys were also lit up (my biggest gripe).  I do wish G Hub was better but it\u2019s not like any comparable software by other companies are anything I\u2019d actually compliment either.  It does the job and it does get maintained. It is obtuse in some ways like how profiles are managed especially with onboard memory and setting up or deleting multiple DPIs.  But at the end of the day I still figured what I needed to do in one session including setting up my own rotating color profile.PBT key caps would be nice but honestly I really like using this keyboard.  It feels great so I guess the ABS key caps do the job just fine.  I use the Tactile version as I dislike extremely clicky keys, but if it helps give you an idea I go for cherry Mx brown switches on those types of keyboards.  Tactile on this keyboard may feel more subtle for some people depending on which keyboards they\u2019ve previously used.  Though regardless of that I\u2019d say the feedback feels good and didn\u2019t take me long at all to get used to.I really and I mean really appreciate how they came up with a small form factor keyboard (even the full size version) that packs as much functionality that it has while also feeling like a solid product. It\u2019s pretty hefty for its size which is great because it does NOT move around. As a gamer this is important.  I\u2019m also very big into music so I greatly appreciate the media keys.  Not only the fact they exist or that they still fit in this small form factor but also because they did them justice.  They don\u2019t feel like a last second decision add on.The complaints I do have are overshadowed by the strengths.  That is my opinion after 2 years of using it.",
          "Keychron K1",
          "Overall, this keyboard is great, and I have no regrets in purchasing it. The battery life on this keyboard is insane, and the responsiveness is also impressive. I haven't noticed any issues while playing video games or typing.The reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because of all the minor issues with the keyboard that keep it from being perfect.- Hard to change the keycaps, so if you want custom ones then be prepared to do a lot of work- The special characters aren't illuminated at all- The Logitech G-hub software is very limited.- You cannot create commands that have multiple keys. So G1 + up Arrow is not a valid trigger- You cannot disable the G1-G5 keys when in game mode",

          "I really like it. The key cap material feels a little cheap for the $200+ price tag, but I haven\u2019t felt like it is enough of a negative to return or recommend other keyboards. There is a little bit of where you can slightly shift the key caps horizontally, but I don\u2019t feel like it gets in the way of my typing at all. Only when I rest my fingers and push completely on the keys do I feel the keycaps slide. They also will only shift maybe a few millimeters. While gaming and typing normally I do not notice it. Trying to press the keys from all angles, I cannot find an angle where they do not register a press. Even on the space bar. The space bar, and all other keys larger than the standard letter and number keys, have a design with three supports so it has always registered a press from whatever angle I pushed on it from. While typing normally I do not run into any problems. I think if you have the cash to spend on it, this keyboard might be worth it for you. It\u2019s all subjective though and I can admit that coming from a wired keyboard the difference is completely for the quality of life improvements over anything like insane response time or other advancements in keyboard technology. It is fast with very low lag, and I don\u2019t feel any lag from a good 15 feet from the adapter, and think I can go way further, but my room is small. Even with stuff like a bed, pillows, and other stuff in the way I cannot see any difference. I imagine that you could game on a tv if you wanted if you sat on the couch, with reliable speed, but I don\u2019t have a large enough screen to check.I wanted the 915 TKL for the wireless, the TKL that frees up space for my small desk, and reliability. By buying this keyboard you are buying it to have a wireless small reliable keyboard. I do not think that it\u2019s any better than a wired keyboard in its technical ability. I used the G512, and other keyboards in the past, and loved them. This keyboard is if you want to spend extra on it. There are more budget keyboards for gaming from Logitech and other brands that have on par response time. This is if you want, and can, spend extra.Bluetooth is fast as well. I\u2019m using it on my phone right now to test it\u2019s Bluetooth ability, and it feels fast enough to say it is a valid choice for whatever Bluetooth ability you need. I do not have the ability to test gaming on Bluetooth however, but would imagine that the USB adapter is much faster and more reliable than Bluetooth due to the nature of Bluetooth being slower than other methods of wireless.I got linear switches and they are quiet and smooth. Going from a clicky G512 to linear it\u2019s exactly what I wanted. Smooth the whole press, and has what I think are great overall ergonomics. I do have large hands though, and can easily reach the F keys even though they have a small space between them and the number keys. This might not be the keyboard for someone with small hands if you plan on using the F keys a lot.Overall, I\u2019d recommend it, but it is expensive. I would recommend waiting for a sale or receiving a gift card to make it more worth it to buy. 9.75/10 (.20 for the key caps, and .05 for the horizontal \u201ckey shifting\u201d)[side note: the brushed metal is not black and does stand out in bright light. I think it\u2019s okay but if you are going for a certain aesthetic look with your keyboard you would have to be looking for a dark metal-y grey with this keyboard.]",
          "The keyboard is beautiful... and thin. Like, HOLY HELL, no need for a wrist rest thin (seriously, used a wrist rest for the last two years with my g810... and poof it went.I got this last week, so here's 'first impressions';PROS:* Not quite sure if this is a pro, but.... the thinner keys didn't take me nearly as long to get used to as I expected. First type, they were more like laptop keyboard keys due to the profile, and I wasn't sure I'd like them. Within the hour I was sold.* I like the metal. I was worried it would be too cold, but the keys keep you from feeling it at all, and I predict cleaning will be way easier* The keys are raised, so blowing air should get rid of all the stuff that normally requires taking keycaps off. Major time saver for those who care about keeping their keyboards clean and maintained.* ON BOARD MEMORY! Hell yes. Finally don't have the rainbow wave every startup like my old g810 (aka, until the program loads up) - Also great if you need to swap it to another keyboard* Stable feet. I like my keyboard raised (old habits), and briefly trying the 512 was a PitA with it's side feet. This one's flip out the back (like my 810), and are stable as a rock.* MEDIA CONTROLS - I fell in love with the volume wheel on my 810, and this thing's is even nicer. I love not having to get out of fullscreen to alter the vol, or fiddle with fn keys.* USB passthrough at LAST! It's one of those \"you don't need it until you have it\" things, but I appreciate it.* New fun built-in viduals. The ripple is cute. Set a color, you get rainbow ripples on keypress emanating from said keypress. REALLY pretty and fun. Also makes it look crazy when you're typing papers and someone sees your keyboard just spazzing the hell out. It's like a sleeper rainbow :PCONS:* Still not MX Cherry switches... my g810, for all I've loved it, started failing right as its warrenty expired (RGB & multi-presses)... and I'm assuming that's due to the switches. These are different, but still Logitech's alternative.* SINCE they are Logitech's, not sure why the shift+ keys aren't illuminated like they were on the g810. I can't say I remember which number gives me & or $ or %, and NOT having them lit up really sucks in low light. At least the big bonus for the 810's 'special' switches was that it lit everything up.* UNLIKE my 810 (older model), not ALL keys allow custom lighting. Just... WHY?!?  * The Num and Caps lock indicators are stuck a bright(er) white, which ruins any light scheme you might have going.  * The Brightness key lets you re-color it, but the game mode key FOR SOME reason is likewise stuck as white.  * The memory keys are likewise stuck in yellow (and on, even with the keyboard NOT on memory mode).I would understand the MR key being stuck red, but WHY the other ones? Why num/caps? Why game mode?* The G keys on the left are too close... might get used to it (hoping I will!) but for now I often hit G5 whenmeaning to hit Ctrl. Seeing as that's a keybind modifier in games, yeah... quite an issue. Wish the G keys were above Functions, or had a bigger gap from the main keyboard, at least.* The new \"G hub\" is atrocious. I know this isn't keyboard specific, but this made me swap from their old \"Logitech Gaming Software\", and it's an obvious downgrade. I had to turn my freaking PTT key into a macro before it let me add it to my mouse keybind. Why? Because it has a list and tells you to drag and drop stuff. Old program? \"click what you want the keybind to be\". Simple, intuitive, easy. Freaking idiots making things touchscreen compatible ruins everything (also, what LGS had in one visual Ghub requires you to swap through several pictures) T_T",
          "Got this for my brother. He loves the keyboard and it looks amazing",
          "After sending two refurbished models back because they either didn't work or because they looked like someone drug them behind their car for 10 miles, I bit the bullet and bought a new one. It's a great keyboard, with a great mechanical feel and features. The only negative I can find is the macro function. Programing the keys is fine, but when they execute the macro, they are exceedingly slow. I use the macro keys to store common phrases I use in my job and even after setting the time to it's lowest setting, it takes forever compared to my old keyboard (an Alienware device). The old keyboard macros were near instant, this one, the letters appear one at a time as if being typed, albeit by a fast typist, but still slow compared to nearly instant.The volume controls and forward / back keys are excellent and get used a lot as well. So far, outside of the macro speed issue, I like the keyboard almost as much as I liked the old one this replaced.",
          "TKL",
          "Overall, the keyboard is great, if I was to be fully honest... if you are not use to a gaming keyboard with hotkeys built in then there will be a small learning curve. For example, the CTRL key and the G5 key or any of the far left keys, getting us to the CRTL key not being the farthest left key gets some getting us to. By default (on my keyboard) the G5 key is set to F5... so if you click it by accident it will refresh any page you are working on. The other issue with the keyboard is that the function keys (symbol keys that share the number keys for example) they are not backlit... I turned on my overhead light in my image to show that these function keys are printed and not backlit... the bottom line, if you are not use to keyboarding... you will have to get close and hover over to see the non-backlit portions of the keys.One thing to note too, is there is software that can help with color arrangements for your keyboard... I was able to set the M keys in the top left to onboard memory to remember my RBG configuration. Very helpful when you are running a KVM. But... If you are running a KVM, the keyboard does not automatically light up when you switch from computer to computer (if anyone was wondering).Overall, I am happy with my purchase, I got this keyboard on Amazon Prime Day and saved $100 ($250 normally back when I purchased) - for the price, I would suggest waiting for a deal like I did.",
          "Battery didn\u2019t last as long as I\u2019m guessing the ones that first came out two years ago.",
          "Update #1 (12/13/2022):The keyboard still feels great after a week. I full charged it after I got it (12/05/2022) and about after a week of on (most nights constant sometimes minimal) use its now at 5%. Its not bad, definitely not the month worth that some people say, but also well within the advertised hours (something like 30hrs playtime).It's just the keyboard, dongle, and the wire in the box. The keyboard itself is super thin, I love it. I'm glad I got the clicky version because it doesn't actually feel that clicky to me, I think it's because the travel distance is less so it's not nearly as a loud as a normal clicky would be.The dongle that the keyboard comes with is connected to a USB A female to micro USB B female. So you could just leave the wire that connects to your keyboard into the back of your computer and still have access to the USB port since it acts as a new adapter for your wire. So far I've just attached the dongle to the micro USB A female and planned to take the dongle out when I want to charge.I'm not a keyboard guy and I have only owned sub $30 keyboards so I don't think I'm as picky as the others. This was definitely a splurge and I don't like spending money (especially for just a keyboard) but I do like to keyboard and at least it feels really nice. For now I'm not sure if it was worth my money but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for my item ($179 for black friday)",
          "I love the keypress responsiveness and ease of depression with this keyboard using the Logitech linear switches! The combination of using the Logitech G915 keyboard with the Logitech MX 3 Mouse makes me so much faster that I don't want to stop getting things done. I discovered that I can do stuff that I never could before typing wise with the G915, such as being able to use the number buttons above the letter buttons on the keyboard for entering data. I found that with this keyboard combined with the functionality of the MX 3 Mouse I enjoy doing the work now that I found tedious before. I get so much done; it is ridiculous! That is why I'm writing this review. It doesn't even bother me at all since it doesn't take very long to do this. Work kind of feels like videogaming right now.The G915 keyboard is almost perfect. The main issue for me is that the home row of keys is linear instead of tactile. The ease of depression results in me needing to think more about raising my fingers back up to prevent accidentally pressing a home key. Since your fingers produce the most force on the home keys, it would be best if the home keys could be chosen to be tactile while the rest of buttons are linear.Prior to purchasing the G915 I had purchased the Alienware 510K keyboard with cherry MX switches. I also have an Arzio Aramato CE keyboard with cherry mx red switches that I have used for years. I use my keyboards in combination with a RollerMouse red plus with the full palm rest. I was looking for a replacement for my Arzio Aramato for when I need to do a lot of typing. The Aramato CE looks amazing, but the issue is the travel distance on the keys don\u2019t allow for fast typing and it is extremely loud. The rounded keys also create gaps where it is easy to miss keypresses.I had tried out the Alienware 510K at a store but not hooked up to a computer to get a true feel for how it types. After hooking it up to my computer and I found that I could not find a truly comfortable angle to use it with my RollerMouse red plus palm rest. The other issues with the 510K are that while its cherry mx red switch were quieter than the Aramato CE\u2019s, with a better short travel distance, they put up far too much resistance. It was especially apparent on the spacebar, the enter key, and the number pad zero key. While I loved the white look, the extra space in front of the end of the keyboard presented a positional problem for reaching the keys while in front of my RollerMouse Red Plus.The Logitech G915 is far superior to both of these keyboards in capability. The fact that it is wireless completely trumps them. Then add on its lighter, with quieter keys, less travel distance as well as easier to activate keys, better lighting capabilities, a scrolling sound control, which is way smoother than the one found on the Aramato CE. Top that off with programmable profiles.I will say that the Aramato CE is still a sexier looking keyboard, but the capabilities of the Logitech G915 are just the cr\u00e8me of the crop. The slight depression and finish on the surface the G915 keys is so good at just holding the fingers in place enough while allowing them to slide when you intend to move your fingers. Even when my fingers start to sweat, they do not slide on these keys unless I intend to slide. I would have loved if the G915 came in a white key color with a silver or white board color scheme! I did not see such options for anything other than the G915 TKL, and the button placement was completely different on that particular version of the TKL.I did also try the G915 TKL version. I was disappointed in this one because they removed the macro keys G1 through G5. They also removed the M1 through MR buttons for program profiles. I was okay with that missing, but the keyboard felt naked and too small without the G1 through G5 macro keys. The G915 TKL is also heavier than the G915. The only improvement the TKL had over the G915 was a storage space to place the USB drive. The USB drive was also larger on the TKL than the G915 which is another thing I thought was strange since the TKL had less features. The only other feature that the G915 could use to improve itself is the soft keys are too mushy on the audio and video buttons, profile buttons, connectivity, and lighting buttons. The soft touch is nice, but it should give a much smoother action with a definitive press like the rest of the keyboard keys.I do think that the Aramato CE did have a better volume scroll wheel access design since it could be grabbed easily, or you could use the thumb to scroll easily, instead of only being able to use your fingers to activate the volume scroll wheel.",
          "this keyboard is very expensive given what it is, but it had all the features I wanted and I don't have the time to mess around with making or ordering some fancy custom keyboard.This keyboard is great for productivity and gaming. haven't noticed any issues with latency.I have yet to use it in the generic bluetooth mode so I have no idea how that will preform. Use lightspeed wireless dongle or wired. wouldn't consider using the generic bluetooth in gaming but nice to know its there in case I have to use it on a different computer and i don't have the dongle or cable.Media keys work fine. so far haven't come across any application that they don't work in. I mostly use itunes or spotify and they work fine.its not a deal breaker but given the price it would be nice if it was USB c and not micro usb. i don't think there is really any performance gain in this situation between the two.. but USB c would be nice as it would easier to plug it in without looking compared to micro usb where I have to make sure its being plugged in the right side up.Battery will last around a week or two with regular usage, but I find this directly affected by how flashy/bright the led pattern/profile is set to. Can be charged and used at the same time without any hiccups. It also warns you with red lights when its dying so there are no mid game surprises.My bigger complaint is more based with the gHub software you have to use to configure it. Its just un-predictable and confusing at times to change things. Has a difficult time loading my default profile on start up occasionally, and will load its default built in profile often on start up and I have to launch the software to make it load even though its supposed to launch and load on start up by default.You technically don't need to use the gHUB software but then you can't map any macros or customize the LEDs (you do have a couple default LED patterns built into it but they are a bit too flashy or a boring color for my taste.)",
          "NOTE: There are 3 different versions of this keyboard: clicky, linear, and tactile.  I first tried the \"clicky\"... and while it felt \"breezy and light\" to type on, the click sound was just a bit too much for me.  Decided to go with the tactile version, which I like much better.Otherwise, this is a great keyboard.  The ability to connect in multiple ways and easily switch between those multiple methods, I could actually switch between multiple devices in the same session (computer and phone)... is a nice feature.  The backlight and changing lights gives the keyboard a nice cool looking effect.My own criticism is the secondary shift-keys are not backlit.... so you really need to know where these characters are located, otherwise  you won't be able be able to find the  ( or * in a dark environment.",
          "This is for the Logitech G815 low profile Linear. It's frustrating sometimes that Amazon combines similar products and the reviews are about the keyboard I'm not looking at. Anyway, I have some serious arthritis and tendonitis issues in both right and left hands and wrists. Surgeries for ruptured tendons, a steel plate on my left wrist holding it together combined with a subpar physical therapy on my last surgery making typing very difficult at times. What works best for my ergonomics is a low profile mechanical keyboard that require very little effort for a keystroke. For years, I had been using the Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 with low profile cherry keys. This G815 actually has a lower profile. The action is a little bit lighter than the low profile cherrys on the K70.But I have a couple of complaints, especially considering the cost. I paid $199. It freaking went down to $169 a day or two after I purchased it. Complaints. The spacebar just isn't right compared to the other keys. It requires a bit more force than the other keys. The left shift key is similar in action.Another thing that bugs me is the lighted keys. All the symbols don't illuminate. Only the non-shift part of the key is illuminated. It's really too bad. Same for keys on the 10 key keypad. Only the numbers illuminate. For $200 all symbols on a key should light up. I'm very disappointed in this.  There absolutely no reason other than saving a few cents per key, making it even more disappointing that all of the key does not light up. Had I researched further, it may have been a deal-breaker for me. They light up on the Corsair K70.It seems writing this the cons outweigh the pros. But the very low profile of the body and the low profile keys, make it a joy to type on. Especially with my physical situation. I mean this thing is thin. The body is about the same thickness as my S22 Ultra.  One thing that's a bit annoying is that it seems like you can only customize the 5 G keys. That's kind of annoying as well. For what it's worth on the Corsair K70, you can customize all keys. For example, I don't use the right windows key or that stupid context key next to it. I like adding my own command to those keys. You can't with this Keyboard and the G-Hub.Bottom line.  Unless you have some physical condition that requires a light touch low profile mechanical keyboard, there are better options out there. I will continue to use it because it has made typing easier, but I regret paying $200 for it.",

          ".)\u207d\u207f\u00b2\u207e Like micro-USB, the use of ABS keycaps says a lot. Why use ABS keycaps on a $200-$300 keyboard? It looks cheap because IT IS CHEAP. Now, I am not asking for metal, but just a couple of extra bucks and they could get PBT. These keycaps will shine (in a bad way) over time, and your keys will fade and scratch off. They will also peel off (more on that below\u207d\u207f\u00b3\u207e). I have had $35 mechanical keyboards that use double-shot PBT. Think about that.\u207d\u207f\u00b3\u207e I understand that the LED's on almost every other mechanical switch is limited to the top portion. What baffles me is Logitech's choice to use traditional keycap design that puts the shifted (secondary) function labels at the bottom, thus ensuring it does not get illuminated fully. It would have been fine partially-lit. However, they literally used a sticker for the labels (you can feel it). Remember, this is a $200-$300 keyboard, in 2020 (not 2010).My other problem with the keycap is that the characters are dark. You cannot see the keys when there is no light. Logitech wants you not to use backlights to save battery, but it is unusable without it. Even when lit, the brightest 100% setting is not bright enough, which makes anything less than 100% almost useless.\u207d\u207f\u2074\u207e I say this because I do use these $70 keyboards from Havit:\u00a0"

          "I've been using this about 2 weeks for gaming and work related tasks; rolled with the dual wireless connectivity options over the cooler looking RGB wired 810 Orion.Initially, I thought the Bluetooth connection was absolutely garbage.  I only tried connecting to my Asus X99 deluxe motherboard's built-in Bluetooth, which utterly failed.  Pairing was always a struggle, and once it was, it never stayed connected (despite the firmware update that specifically said it addressed that issue).  Best case I'd spam a key, and several seconds would pass before it would register.  If I was real lucky I'd get about 20 seconds of ok typing before it decided to go back to saying 'paired' instead of 'connected'.  But it seems that this is only an issue for my MOBO's built-in Bluetooth (so far).I tried connecting it with my Sony x900e 4k TV, and it actually works really well.  Navigation through any of the TV menus works fine, as well as entering or exiting any apps.  Typing in any text box works well too, no laggy input or intermittent connection issues.  Even the media controls work well; tested in Netflix app and all function as expected, (stop acting as back / exit).I also tried the Bluetooth with my HP laptop, and the keyboard both paired and functioned perfectly well.  Programmed all day via Bluetooth to my laptop, and could seamlessly switch to my desktop Pc via the wireless dongle just by pressing those 2 buttons on the board.  This was one of the main reasons I got this board; the ability to have 1 keyboard for 2 separate devices being utilized at the same time.  The only downside I found while finally using Bluetooth typing on a computer, was that the G macro keys are not available over Bluetooth, which is an expected sacrifice for not using the wireless dongle that pairs with the gaming software.The wireless dongle delivers adequate performance, but I've already noticed some annoying things about it.  Gaming seems solid, except one time a key got randomly re-mapped (ESC acted like it was my emote button in Overwatch...while I was in the menu during a game, eventually worked itself out but you can imagine how triggering that can be...).  So far it has only happened once, will edit this post if I ever see other strange things occur.Otherwise the wireless connection seems fine; didn't notice any input lag moving around in Overwatch, and feels way faster compared to my very old G15 wired keyboard.  Granted, I'm definitely biased about the speed of the physical key actuation / point of virtual registration since I'm coming from a membrane type board, but still probably says something about the speed of the wireless connection itself.One other random thing I noticed was when the auto-sleep mode goes on, it takes a sec to wake back up and sometimes actually writes nonsense characters at my cursor (e.g. instead of a line being copied via ctrl-c, some random 'c-10' text or something was written over my line).  I guess minor issue that ends up saving you battery power, but when you're programming that can be extremely annoying especially if you don't realize it happened.  Not too convenient to have to hit a 'safe key' first to make sure its actually on...would be nice to be able to control the 'sleep mode' timer of the keyboard with the Logitech gaming software....new firmware upgrade please and thank you Logitech...I know how to turn things off when I'm done using them :)On a side note, a bonus cell phone stand comes with this board, and it's actually pretty nice; low profile and stable (have to put phone on it sideways when charging since most ports on at the bottom these days...but still pretty nice for a freebie extra that I actually prefer over another cheap one I bought).Final thought, wish the wrist rest was removable. I already have a nice cushioned wrist rest, and having to place it ontop of the fixed hard plastic wrist rest completely changes the feel of using the keyboard.  Even though my wrists are probably positioned higher and therefore ergonomically healthier, could do without having to stack wrist rests.",
          "Really like this keyboard, it was a good price, has both wireless (via usb) or Bluetooth capabilities, so it\u2019s good for gaming and switching to use for work. It is really large and doesn\u2019t have backlit keys, so if this matters to you, it\u2019s probably not the right fit.",
          "First of all, let me inform you that there was a firmware update a few months ago that fixes a petty issue that some reviewers complained about. When the keyboard went to sleep, it would lose the first keypress as it woke up again. So if you pressed shift to make the first letter of a sentence capital, the letter would still be lowercase when you pressed. it. That was easy enough to work around, but still annoying.That issue is fixed. You are all welcome for the news. (I am just happy to tell you.)In my lifetime I have had dozens of keyboards. From the beloved jackhammers known as the IBM model M with the \"Bulking Spring\" keycaps, all the way to membrane garbage keyboards. I like mechanical keyboards enough that I would not dream of using a membrane keyboard again. But I hated Cherry Red and Cherry Black because I could never be sure I had actually pressed the key.This keyboard has a slight feel to the key actuation. Not enough to bother you, but just enough to notice the feel of the key actuating.The keyboard is very solid. It is not light weight. And it does not move on it's own as you type. For typing this is as good as it can be on a wireless keyboard.Some reviewers mentioned the lettering coming off. I have seen no evidence of this at all. And I thought that perhaps it was something solving the lettering off like oil does to some materials. But I have typed on mine while eating fried chicken. And while I do take a moment to clean it off afterwards, I see no evidence that this caused any problems.The battery life is truly amazing. I have no yet had this a year, but from what I read, it will still be working just fine for more than a year.I have not yet tried the Bluetooth function. But I am very happy it has this as it future proofs this great keyboard for me.The only thing I wish this had was a chargeable Lithium battery and a backlight. But running off a single disposable 1.5 volt Alkaline AA battery, I can certainly understand why it lacks a backlight.I bought this because what eventually dies in every keyboard I have ever owned is the cord. I have swithced to a wireless Headset for exactly the same reason, and it works. My current wireless Headset is several years old now, and I expect it will be at least several more years before I need to do anything with it.For those of you reading this who really need a backlight, consider my solution instead. I can only see out of one eye at current. And my vision is rather dark all the time in my working eye. So I bought and mounted a tiny part of a cheap 2700 Kelvin strip light under my monitor. I then blocked most of the light with a thin strip of paper mounted to the front of my monitor. This leaves a very dim amount of light that washes over the entire keyboard. The white lettering on the keys reflects the light very well.With this, the keys look grey rather than black, but the white lettering is a very bright white with zero glare at all. I wish I could take a picture to show you, but I lack a camera of any sort.I occasionally have to go to the hospital for a few weeks at a time, and short of leaving the light on and just enduring the terrible glare it causes, I have a very hard time seeing the keys.I hope this helps those of you who need an idea to help with seeing it.Anyone who has a portable solution, please share. Thanks in advance.",
          "First of all I gave this 3 stars for gaming simply due to not having used it for gaming. It is so different from my other recent keyboards that I'm just not getting used to it and imagine I'd still die quickly in games. For those used to it, it's probably great.The 6 programmable keys .. Well, I'm on linux. Good luck finding any logitech software. Instead, look for \"Solaar\". Install it. Turn on \"Divert G Keys\" and use it's rule editor. If you use Linux I'm sure you can figure it out. If not, there's always reddit.Having just those keys setup in a certain way makes my programming sessions massively more productive. They're basically macrod to switch through programs in certain ways depending on certain conditions but when you have dozens open this can be a big time saver. On linux you can create a shell script and point a \"rule\" to it instead of having to use it's clunky rules where you enter each argument separately.As for the keyboard itself. It's ridiculous these cost so much truly. It brings me back to my youth where maybe it's just my luck but a lot of the keyboards I wound up with were mechanical and cost about 10-20 bucks but hey, times change.For what I have for now, I'm really happy with this. I'm not sure about Windows/Mac users that use the official Logitech software but I can easily set the F!-12 keys or any other key to a script if I wish (and likely will due to lack of me using the F keys in Arch Linux).It has nice feed back. It feels solid. As for ergonomics ... I gave it 4 stars. It tries. I think it does alright. I don't think any keyboard really ever gets it perfect. It's definitely more comfortable than my last.I'd dug through over a hundred in the 20-500 dollar price range before settling on this one. Yes there's some with flashy lights if you care or extra keys (but again any on here can be repurposed) but this keyboard's working out perfectly for me.Finally having full-size keys again is nice. It seems like even normal keyboards nowadays are usually stuffed together. This one feels great.A couple bonuses. One not so big - media controls. Alright but nothing special.The other - You can connect this via the dongle and via bluetooth allowing you to quickly swap between multiple devices. This has made my chromecast \"typing\" much more enjoyable but also if I were to need to pull out more machines again it would save desk space.Early morning review. Don't mind if it's not the best. The points are made. It's a decent keyboard for the price. I'm happy with it.",
          "This keyboard ticks a lot of boxes. It comes with everything you need, and nothing you don't. Logitech's wireless technology is fantastic. I've never had any issues with disconnection or connection issues and this keyboard is no exception. Upgraded to this from a G910 Orion Spectrum, so I was already used to the key switch in this keyboard. For those who are wondering, this doesn't come with normal mechanical switches. These keyboards use Logitech's Romer-G switch. They're meant to be a tactile switch, which means there's a tactile bump you can feel when you type on the keyboard. The G910 I upgraded from already had these switches so these feel completely great to me. When it comes to the switches, you either love them or hate them. There's no in between. I personally love these switches. They feel good and they have a nice stock sound to them. The keyboard comes with 6 programmable macro keys, which is nice for a multitude of applications and are fully configurable in the Logitech app. The only complaint I have with this keyboard is that there is not any backlighting/RGB. However, it makes sense since its wireless and powered by AA batteries. All things considered, this keyboard performs fantastically and is quite great to type on. I definitely recommend this keyboard.",
          "In my quest to find good a good wireless keyboard (I'm trying to cut down on all the wires around my PC), I decided to try this keyboard out and have been really enjoying it so far. I went from a TKL MK to this, so the size was something I had to adjust to.Currently enjoying:- Wireless - I'm a casual gamer. The types of games I like to play are FPS games, but I usually try any game that looks interesting. I was really worried about the lag since there's no wire, but I haven't noticed anything to worry about. I don't have to worry about an extra wire to organize, and I can also move the keyboard out of the way when the cats try to lay on it. Big bonus lol.- G keys and Media keys - as I was on a TKL MK before this, I didn't have the option to really customize my keyboard experience (was too lazy to even try). I used to have to click around to mess with sound settings and whatnot. Now, all of this can be taken care of via the customizable keys. I love this feature.- Very easy to connect via Wireless (haven't tried Bluetooth).Neutrals:- Keys are very sensitive. Doesn't matter much to me since I press down fully anyway, but this might be a good thing for others.- Keys are clicky. They have nice sound and touch but, from what I remember, they really don't hold up well to the Cherry Switches. Still good though.- No LEDs. Probably a negative for some, but I don't usually use LEDs in my builds so this doesn't matter much to me.Not enjoying:- Not Cherry switches. For me, this is probably the biggest negative to this keyboard. I think Logitech as a whole has proprietary switches? As someone who likes changing keycaps constantly, this makes me pretty sad. Also, I was hoping to move to some Blues for my next keyboard (my MK keyboard had Silent Reds), but it just wasn't meant to be since Logitech doesn't use Cherrys.- The wrist rest area - I want the option to remove it. Adds basically 50% more surface area to an already big keyboard. Makes me wonder if there's some wiring or whatnot in it. Why else wouldn't they allow users to pick whether to use it or not? Either way, I hate it.Haven't tested:- Durability - I've had this keyboard for not even a full month yet.- Battery life - See above.Really solid keyboard. My previous keyboard lasted 2 years before I decided to buy a new one just for a wireless feature. I'm hoping I'll keep this keyboard around for a while as well.",
          "Reading a lot of the negative reviews, I've noticed a trend--they seem to have tried other mechanical keyboards. I had not! So, if you've had other mechanical keyboards, I'd probably read those reviews prior to making a purchase decision.To those of you moving away from membrane keyboards, who don't know the difference between Romer G and Cherry, who just want an affordable (erm . . . relatively, anyway) keyboard that is a step above non-mechanical keyboard and has the ease and convenience of wireless, and who aren't pro gamers where every femtosecond of response time is crucial, and who don't care about RGB (and thus are the elect, as RGB is the lamest, trashiest, most low class tryhard fad to ever grace technology), I'd say this keyboard is a good option. There might be better! But I've had it for over a year, and I like it quite a bit. It probably won't stand up to the standards of the mechanical aristocracy, but for the nouveau mechanical, it's not a bad choice.",
          "I was skeptical about the advertised battery life and input lag of a wireless keyboard. I have to admit, I'm impressed with this after about a month of ownership. There's no signs of deteriorating connection quality, in the advertised lifespan of a couple double AA batteries seems to be accurate.I use both a Bluetooth and RF connection to swap between multiple monitors, as it's more effective than my KVM USB switch. The connections are picked up quite easily. Windows 10 and 11 both turn on the Bluetooth radio before booting in, so there's no problem using the Bluetooth connector to sign into Windows in case anyone was worried about that.In terms of cost cutting and battery efficiency, the only issue or aspects of the keyboard that I could find was that the keys are not back lit. This makes perfect sense to me as leaving though lights on would obvious drain on the battery. These are the romer g keys that I have come to love on other Logitech mechanical keyboards. If you're not familiar with these keys, they are mechanical keys but incredibly quiet. There's no problem talking to someone on the phone and typing or playing with a discord mic open while mashing key binds.Lastly, there is a power switch, and that was a deal breaker for me when I purchased the keyboard. However I usually forget to turn off the power, and it hasn't had any noticeable effect on the lifespan of the batteries. I still recommend turning the keyboard off every time, but I usually don't and I haven't noticed any hit to the battery life. So that was cool. Oh! I was also concerned that this was a AA battery powered device rather than something rechargeable with USB c or the like. That is not been an issue, however, since the double a batteries have not needed to be replaced in a month or more of use.",
          "I love this new keyboard. Just bought this the other day and also typing this review on it. Here are some things I've noticed about this:Pros:1. Keys feel authentic (meaning in terms of mechanical feel)2. My fingers glide pretty good on the keys. I don't have to press hard on the keys for them to register.3. The volume up/down key work on my laptop, for those who really like this \"laziness\" feature.4. The programmable keys work very well, but for those who don't use external apps to configure keyboard settings, the Logitech G Hub app that is downloadable off the Logitech website was a little hard to understand for me. This was my first keyboard I had to configure, so I had to watch some videos on YouTube to understand the app (P/C)5. The response time it says on the product, 1 ms, lives up to its name. It's little to no delay when I'm typing on this, so I think any gamer or anybody working from home during these times would love a keyboard like this!6. This keyboard has a well crafted feel to it, meaning it's not flimsy, pretty sturdy, and looks clean.Cons:1.  I got this keyboard not for its gaming purpose, but mainly for looks and specs, and the other media controls on the keyboard, Play/Pause, Stop, Previous Track/Next Track, do not seem to respond. Maybe I'm just being an idiot, but when I use them on an app like Spotify, the buttons specified don't work.2. SInce I type fast, my fingers tend to slip onto other keys, sometimes hitting the programmable keys on the left. I tried using Game Mode on the G Hub app, and it won't let me select the programmable keys to turn off so I don't accidentally bump them while typing. Bummer, but I'll live.3. Haven't found a use yet for the bluetooth feature, where you can swap devices easily with the touch of a button. Only have one computer, so this feature seems pretty useless to me.4. The keyboard was heavier than I expected. Not like unbelievably heavy but I was shocked that this was 3 pounds! Not really important to me, but somebody might find this helpful.Overall: I love this keyboard! Some things may not work, but for its intended use, I think it's a keeper. I would definitely get it again",
          "I originally purchased this keyboard in 2018. It broke recently due to really me not cleaning it or maintaining it properly, also I spilled a drink. Up to that point, it was extremely reliable, never had any issues with any of the wifi or bluetooth connectivity. The keys on the one I purchased in 2018 were a bit springy and used to have a noise like a small metal reverberation after pressing but that has since been resolved (and originally went away with wear over time).The battery I only ever replaced once in my life (i think) it freaking lasts forever. This is a great keyboard that I use to switch between my work pc and my personal PC with the click of a button, saves me a lot of time in not having to connect keyboards back and forth.Maybe not the best for gaming, but I highly recommend! It's a very solid hybrid to switch quickly between multiple devices, from the same area.",
          "Overall, great keyboard. Not great ergonomically, but it is what it is. Unfortunately after 2.5 years the keys started to repeat consistently. I don't abuse my keyboard, even cleaned it with connector cleaner. Unfortunately nothing helped.Disappointed with the lack of durability, but when it worked it worked great. Would constantly switch between Bluetooth and the wireless receiver depending on which computer I wanted to use, and this keyboard did it perfectly.",
          "DISCLAIMER: i am not a gamer and do not use this for games, this review is from non gaming perspectiveThis is my first mechanical keyboard and wow, the tactiles of typing on this are great, SO much better and more comfortable and pleasurable than a membrane keyboard.  I should have been typing on a keyboard like this my entire life lol.  Now I am a mechanical newbie so i can't compare it to all the cherry brown, red, etc. switches that the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole can lead you down but compared to membrane keyboards its a BIG improvement.The keyboard also has a palm rest which adds even further to the comfort of the typing experience.  Add that to the inherent convenience of the wireless format and you can choose exactly how you want to use the keyboard for maximum comfort.  The mute and volume up and down keys on the top right of the keyboard are very convenient and indirectly increase comfort too by saving you from using the mouse.  Theres actually a whole media playback suite on the top right, with a stop, skip forward and backwards, and pause/play button as well. The battery life is also amazing.  I use my desktop about 3 days a week about all day/12 hours (when i'm off work) and I haven't had to charge it for 4 months, its still at 80% battery life in fact.  This is on bluetooth mode so note it might be different in 2.4 ghz mode.  I also admittedly am not a writer or anything.  i just use social media fairly often which tends to be shorter messages.The main flaws with the keyboard are that its kind of heavy and when you haven't typed anything for a while the keyboard goes into a sleep mode, and when you start typing again it will lag for 5 seconds or so while it \"wakes up\".  but once it wakes up its butter smooth , no lag at all.",
          "This is the first mechanical keyboard I've owned. I've been gaming and typing on the same $20 microsoft membrane keyboard at work and at home for almost 10 years. I've had friends who've owned expensive $150 logitech keyboards with useless displays built in and lights that frequently failed after several months so I've always stayed away from them. I was excited to find a full size +10 key wireless mechanical keyboard and hesitant because it was Logitech. As soon as I got it out of the box I found myself enjoying the sensation of typing on a mechanical keyboard. It's not that loud compared to membrane keyboards with a lot of miles on them. As someone who tends to make a big fuss about the neighbors dog barking several houses down that comment should hold a bit of weight. It's really only about as loud as a Microsoft ergonomic membrane keyboard with a year or so worth of typing on it.This keyboard is twice as heavy as my basic membrane keyboard. I was kind of surprised at how heavy it was. Almost as heavy as a 15\" laptop but with a wider footprint. Not something you can just scoop off of your lap easily.The proprietary roamer G switches are super easy to accidentally press because they don't have much resistance to them. Some of the tactile bumps of the keys are softer on my \"A\" key than the rest of my keys and when you accidentally press it slowly just from your finger hovering over it and resting on it a bit too much you don't even feel the bump until you have a screen full of aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa or your game character starts taking a hard left. The keys are not as quiet as my nearly silent membrane keyboards but I've got co-workers and cubicle neighbors who's keyboards are about as loud (They use different membrane keyboards). I do hear a spring sound when I'm hitting the space bar a lot and the keyboard is resting on my lap, even with my big headphones over my ears, the spring sound just kind of echo's out from the internals of the keyboard. The spacebar has a sharp edge that hits my thumb at an uncomfortable angle but that might also be because I use the keyboard on my lap most of the time, though I can't imagine it being any better when used on a flat surface. I could put a thin bit of foam on the sharp edge to soften the blow, but I haven't yet so I must not be that bothered by it.The programmable macro keys on the side are not keys I'm a fan of. They confuse you into thinking you're on the wrong row of keys. I go to hit the escape key and I end up somehow hitting the G1 key at the top of those macro keys. Plot twist, I've programmed G1 to just hit the escape key as well. But this auxiliary line of keys can make it hard to get re-centered on the correct keys because there's this weirdness your brain does when you've not gotten totally used to it that makes it hard to just guide your hand in from the edge of the keyboard by touch. I'm getting used to it after almost 2 weeks but it's still a bit alien and I wish they were somewhere else maybe above the f1-f4 keys. The rest of the shortcut keys for media playback are nice, solid buttons, you can feel the volume up and down button being distinctly different and don't have to look at the keyboard to know which one you are hitting. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little toggle switch to turn off the windows key with \"gaming mode\" several other keys can be programmed off while that switch is toggled but I only care about the windows context menu keys being off. The power switch on the side is nice too. There's no pc power button which I like, because I have a toddler that likes to walk up and surprise me by pressing buttons on my keyboard and he was good at finding that PC power button on other wireless keyboards I've tried out.I'm sad I can't find a wide variety of replacement keycaps and I've already replaced the w, a, s, d, and 1, 2, 3, keys just so I have an easier time being certain I'm on the right keys when my hands try to go back into place. The proprietary roamer G switches aren't just something you can put any fancy key cap on. The only ones I could find were from a different keyboard. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1RZSFM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 But the swap went perfectly fine, I just wish I had more variety, maybe companies will start making compatible caps soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll give me a nicer space bar. I now despise typing on my membrane keyboards because I miss the precise feel of the Logitech.",
          "So, I got this keyboard kind of as an entry point into mechanical keyboards, as a substitute to my trusty wired Logitech K120.And over 2 years past my initial purchase in 2019, it's finally having issues and out of warranty. On the plus side, the batteries it came with have not run out since I bought the thing - though that could be attributed to the fact I wasn't using it for a few seasons as well, but when I'm using it, it's my daily driver. Gaming, both WASD and rhythm, coding, writing.Which brings me to the issue. One of my first keys has finally started to experience 'chatter' where you press a key once and it sends multiple rapid inputs. Thankfully it's  not one I use for gaming, the \"i\" key but I now have to toggle a software solution on and off to intercept these ghost key presses so I can type passwords and regular words with relative peace of mind.This can be caused either by debris (which cleaning did not resolve for me) or by the Romer-G switches failing. And unlike many mechanical keyboards, these switches are  relatively expensive (I'm not even sure Logitech makes them, you have to get Chinese substitutes) and soldered individually. Sounds like more hassle than it's worth, so I'll make do with software until it becomes unusable.Featurewise, it's alright. One of my first phones, a Galaxy Note 5, didn't like the bluetooth pairing, had to make multiple attempts to authenticate pairing every time I wanted to use it. The macro keys are too easy to hit for me, and while I've gotten mostly used to it, I still hit them when searching for my CTRL and ESC keys. The 'Game Mode' switch that prevents you from hitting keys has seen little use from me, but notably, you can't disable the macro keys in Game Mode anyway - just unbind them to have no function (you can do this per-game or globally, but still) The wrist rest isn't removable but I haven't needed to remove it, it's a static keyboard saving me a wire.When a keyboard valued at 120$MSRP is lasting less time than the 20$ K120 because of potentially just dust from use, I think I'll save my money and stick with membrane boards going forwards.",
          "I am overall very satisfied with this keyboard, so really I'm just going to break this into a list of pros and cons. The key switches are subjective (so I will not include them in the pros and cons), but I do think they are pretty good switches. Similar to Cherry MX Browns, but with a bit more tactile bump, shorter travel distance, and maybe a bit more friction. It's a slightly different feel, but I don't mind it after getting used to it. Then again, I am not a keyboard snob, so I can get used to just about anything. Having said that, since this keyboard is not backlit, it seems kinda strange to have used Romer-G switches instead of Cherry MX switches since superior backlighting is one of the main benefits of Romer-G. Oh well.Actually, I'm just going to list the cons. I have no major complaints about this keyboard. I think it's solidly built, easy to setup, and just generally works well and feels nice. Hence the 4-star rating. The cons list are all minor gripes that don't really take away from my enjoyment of the keyboard at all.Cons:-I don't like the G key layout. Normally, the ESC key is the top left key, but on this keyboard, it's G1. It really throws me off as I frequently use ESC to get out of menus. Might just end up mapping G1 to ESC to get around it.-The wrist rest isn't removable. It adds several inches to the keyboard that I was rather do without. I'm not sure why keyboards even still have wrist rests since actually resting your wrists there is likely to give you carpal tunnel. Without a wrist rest, this would fit perfectly on my lap board. With the rest, it hangs off the side.-As mentioned above, no backlight. For me, not a huge issue, and I have to assume the backlight is absent for battery life considerations, but it's strange to use Romer-G switches and not have a backlight.-My one gripe about the switches is that you can faintly here the springs when you type. In actual use, this doesn't bother me, but it makes it seem a bit cheaper.-The media keys just don't feel good to use. Not a huge deal for my particular use case, but I would've preferred the roller from the G610 and buttons with a bit mushier feel.",
          "I'm probably jumping the gun on this as I just received this today and only had a chance to use it for a few hours. That said, I really like it thus far and don't have any issues. The wireless was a plug n' play, as was the integration to the Logitech gaming software. Really, it couldn't have been any easier.I'm likewise thrilled with the ergonomics of the keyboard. It comes with a build in \"carpal buster\" wrist pad that seems to be the perfect angle and size. This is addressing the repetitive use injury I have, and was the reason I bought it. It's already feeling better because it's taking all the stress of my hands and wrist and I couldn't be happier.The Romar Keys are really unique. I won't lie: it's going to take some time to get used to them, but I really love the quick actuation with the tactile feel. It feels comparable to my Cherry Red keys from a previous keyboard I owned, yet is a little snappier/springier. I think if I was a gamer, I'd love this keyboard for PC computer games. As a coder/tech writer/multimedia guy I think this is going to be a great fit once the learning curve goes away. It will be interesting to see if I can increase my typing speed.I love keyboards with G-Keys for macros and such, and Logitech's gaming software is top notch for functionality. I've used it for years and have zero complaints about it.  So the 6 provided programmable hotkeys and companion software are really well received with me and I already use them a lot.This however is unfortunately a segway to my only issue: Logitech has migrated away from gaming keyboards with the 12+ programmable macro keys, gaming keypads, and such. Man I loved those things. Even though I'm not a gamer, I used those things to hotkey my macros and shortcuts which optimized my workflow. It is amazing chewing though tasks in minutes with what would take me an hour using these kind of hotkeys linked to macros. Fingertip access to automated tasks makes awesome versatility.Logitech: if you are reading this, please bring this kind of stuff back. The 18 G-Key setup integrated into a modernized keyboard with your Romer keys, and driven by the excellent software you've already developed? There would be so much win in that equation and I would purchase that in a heartbeat.Regardless: I really like this keyboard. It's another win for Logitech, making this the 6th time I've purchased with few or zero regrets. I'm hoping to purchase more in the future with the old school macro setups and new school mechanical switches should they come out.",
          "I am a Logitech fan.  I mice, I have one of their keyboards for my iPad and I purchased this keyboard to replace my old Microsoft wireless keyboard that finally died.  Important to me were mechanical keys and a typical keyboard layout.  The gaming and Bluetooth features are good to have, but not as important as the good standard layout.  This is a large keyboard, so I see it mostly suitable for a PC setup.  People with laptops who enjoy more portability might not be as impressed as I am.  It's great for my purposes.",
          "This suited all of my requirements. I desired battery powered, but not an internal lithium one. Simply regular batteries that I can change, which should increase overall longevity. Didn't want a ton of extra keys and I desired mechanical keys of some sort.Two drawbacks I have noticed. The first is the keys are rubbing off already. Which means the key text was printed on the surface instead of embedded into the key. The second is there is no indicator of any kind to let you know when the num lock is on. So you may need to find an Windows app for this.",
          "I was on the hunt for a good wireless keyboard that i could with my laptop in the livingroom. I have a setup with a monitor that i can lift up from between the couch and the table and position to my front left so i can use the computer for work and play at home, or to just browse the internet while watching TV.Finding a good keyboard that can do everything was hard! I also have 4 kids that like to destroy things so i needed something tough. Everything i found was $200+, except for this 79 dollar beauty.So the first thing is that i paid $79 for this keyboard 8 months ago, at this price i would expect that its not going to have all the features and functionality of a $200 keyboard, there has to be sacrifices. Its also important to note that Logitech's website says the MSRP for this is $149.99, I wouldn't pay that much for this keyboard.Pros first:1) The keys are nice and springy, definitely not for everyone. People that are used to certain kinds of cherry switches may dislike these. For myself, i think they are good... This keyboard does well for gaming, for typing, and for everything i've used it for... I can type 150+ WPM with my normal every day typing speed landing anywhere between 100 and 120 WPM. The keyboard on my gaming desktop is the Corsair K95 (with 18 G keys) and uses the Cherry MX Brown switches. I think i like using these a little bit more.2) Its mechanical! This means key presses will be more consistent due to higher quality parts (talking about actuation distance, pressure to actuate, etc...) and its going to last longer. Its like getting more for your money!3) There's a bunch of G keys that allow you to record custom macros for games where you may need it.4) Volume and media controls that can be pressed without having to press a Fn key.5) Bluetooth AND Lightspeed technology! Of course, use Lightspeed, only use bluetooth if you have to. Lightspeed gets you 1ms response times, essentially matching the speed of corded keyboards!6) Its built tough! The keyboard has already been flung off my lap, sat on, kicked 3 feet, and jumped on multiple times by a 35lb toddler.Cons:1) The volume up and down should be a roller not buttons.2) While the mechanical keys work well (they are Romer G Tactile), they can sometimes sound like little bells with some of the extra noises they make when quickly removing your finger from a key after pressing it. Every time i hear it, i feel like it might be super cheap and break, but it just hasnt yet (which is great!).3) The wrist rest does not come off. This can be a deal breaker for some people! For me, i like this and it gives me something to easily hold on to when moving it around. I prefer this for my current setup but most setups will not like this.4) Lights for Caps, Scroll Lock, and Num Lock. There's no Num Lock and Scroll Lock lights, its caused me a bit of confusion a few times and i still havent gotten used to it but i realize quickly each time when something goes wrong that i just need to hit the button again to fix the issue (like num lock). When it comes to the Caps Lock button, there's a square shaped light at the top for this and a battery light next to it. I can never remember that the other light is a battery light so when i toggle caps, i see one light on and the other off and im not really sure which is which so i find myself toggling caps lock multiple times often just to get the light right. If this was the only keyboard i used, i probably wouldnt have this issue. The labels below these lights are incredibly hard to see too, they are black text on a dark gray background, terrible contrast.5) No lights! Lights on a gaming keyboard should not be optional. They should always have them! In this case, because this is a cheaper keyboard, i would only expect white lights... However, back to that $150 price tag that Logitech originally wanted, you can find other gaming keyboards of comparable quality and more features at that price point. This is a big no-no on this keyboard in my opinion! I didnt reduce stars still because backlighting on a keyboard is rarely a necessity. The light from a monitor will almost always light up the keyboard just fine, but with some setups, the keyboard is in a drawer which is blocking the light when pulled out.Final Verdict:I still give this keyboard 5 out of 5 stars because its a great deal at this price point. A good gaming keyboard with these features is hard to beat at $80. I wouldn't pay more than $99.99 for this keyboard. Once you pass the $100 mark, there's plenty of other keyboards that can exceed this one.",
          "Impressive run. Started having double tap issue after 4.5 years. Other than that, still works. 18 month battery life is true. After looking around some, I decided to just reorder it again. It's perfect for me. I only wish it had replaceable switches.",
          "So before this I was just using some old dell usb keyboard which this was quite the upgrade from.  I chose this mostly for the lightspeed wireless and bluetooth switching and the fact it took normal batteries.Overall I like the keyboard, with 0 empirical data I'd guess I type slightly better on this kb than I did on the dell.Dislikes: biggest issue to me is the G keys which are ONLY special with some logitech software suite on and running (and this software does not work over bluetooth).  I haven't tried it because why do I have to keep your software running just to use these keys? The keyboard sends the same keypress for the G keys as the corresponding F key so you can't even use them as extra keys when binding keys in a game, as far as I can tell if you don't want to use the software or you're going over bluetooth the only use for these keys is they still work when the \"gaming mode\" switch is on so you can turn off all the F keys but still use G1-6 as the F keys.  Anyway that's a big long wall of text to say I don't care for how these keys work and would be fine without them.Also a number lock light would be cool.Overall I'm really happy with the keyboard but the G keys feel like some scummy attempt from logitech to force you into using their software all the time and I don't think there's any reason they couldn't have let the keys register as something other than duplicates of the F keys without it.",
          "The battery on this keyboard lasts for a very long time. It uses two AA batteries and I've only needed to change them twice in two years.",
          "Starting off, this would have been a 2 or 3 star rating, but some of that is my own pickiness with keyboards - I much prefer flatter keys because they're much easier to work with with long nails (it's difficult to tell key height from a picture), and I'm really not a fan of mechanical keyboards but it's difficult to find a good gaming set with the extra buttons where I want them.Taking that out of the equation, I'd start off at 3 stars because it's a really big annoyance that the keyboard and mouse came with separate dongles. If I'd ordered them separately, I'd totally understand, but I ordered the keyboard + mouse set. On top of that, it doesn't seem they can be linked to the same dongle, which is annoying. The reason I gave a star back was because they can be connected via Bluetooth, and so far that seems to work well for the keyboard. It's not intuitive to connect the mouse to Bluetooth, but at least that brings me down to using one dongle. Also a factor is it's definitely a nice touch to add the USB extender cables; most folks have all their USB slots in the back of their rig, and that can lead to some minor signal issues. So worst case if I need my front USB slots back or run into issues with the Bluetooth connection I have an easy way to connect both dongles to the rear USB ports.Now here's hoping I can actually get used to the keyboard and actively like it!",
          "Very good keyboard, Slick, low key. Great connectivity. I got this for the great price and because it has no LED lights. I hate LED lights on my keyboard and mouse. I may be an outlier but I am grateful for this keyboard! 5/5",
          "I really want to give this a 5 star review, but it has these 6 extra buttons on the left side of the keyboard. It makes the keyboard longer than you expect, so you will put your hands on the wrong place if you are used to using a normal keyboard.WHY? Please just make a regular high quality keyboard for a good price, why do companies have to add all this bullcrap that ruins the product. There isn't a single person who has found those extra buttons useful, but I guarantee you many find them annoying.",
          "This is one solid keyboard.  The buttons feel just right.  It is the best keyboard I have ever used.  The button to switch to bluetooth is super easy.  It is right on the keyboard and not a switch.  I can hit one key to go back to the pc dongle with ease.  It is heavy, but that causes it to be very solid.  I sent back 3 other keyboard and mice combos that just didn't work well.",
          "The paint on key DFG were coming off after 6 months.",
          "TLDR: Its fantastic.Before buying this I was using a $10 Logitech KS120 keyboard from Walmart, which I loved. I had been leery of wireless keyboards for years because they were expensive and introduced latency. But when I read up on this and saw its claimed 1ms latency I was intrigued. That it was mechanical was icing on the cake.After using it for a few days I can say this is the best keyboard I've ever used. I love it. Typing on it feels great. The keys are not too loud too, which is a nice bonus for late night gaming/programming while my wife and kids are sleeping. I haven't done any measurements, but was not able to perceive any latency when playing FPS games.My favorite extra feature I didn't buy it but was surprised to have is quick switching between Logitech's proprietary low latency wireless and Bluetooth. This means I can pair to my phone and quickly type out a text message and then switch back to my PC.NOTE: You may, like I did, assume that the wrist base is detachable. It is not! However after using it for a few days I love it anyway. But if you're expecting it to be removable you'll be disappointed.There are no USB ports, but what do you expect, its wireless. I already have ports on my PC and my monitor anyway. It also has 10 key rollover which is fine, because I don't have any more fingers than that anyway. There is no RGB, which is a huge plus in my book. I wish there was a NumLock light though its only got Caps Lock.The only downside so far as been the Logitech software. You need to keep it running for the G1-G6 keys to remain useful - otherwise they revert to just being F1-F6. And I keep hitting G1 on accident so I had to map it to Escape. I had to install the new GHUB software, but that didn't support my old G35 headphones and mx518 mouse so those stopped working. Luckily if you dig for it you can find an old version of Logitech Gaming Software, version 9.02.65, and it supports both my legacy devices and this keyboard.Overall I'd highly recommend this for anyone interested in a good, relatively inexpensive (compared to others) keyboard who also want low latency and a not stupid keyboard layout.",
          "My wife has a bookkeeping business and uses her computer 10+ hours per day.  She's always used the keyboards that came with her computers, so she has never experienced excellence.I bought a G613 for my own use (I do zero gaming) because I wanted a mechanical, wireless keyboard.  The fact that it uses AA batteries is a HUGE plus for me, because I do not want to have to charge it like a cell phone.In the 1970s and early 1980s I used an IBM Selectric typewriter, and then later I used IBM buckling spring keyboards with my PCs.  Those were great keyboards.  This G613 is not similar to a buckling spring keyboard, but is truly wonderful to type on, in its own way.The keys actuate smoothly, consistently and precisely.  I can detect the spring \"twang\" that some complain about, but it doesn't bother me (or more importantly, my ultra-sensitive wife).The G613 is a very high quality, professional looking and feeling keyboard.  Very solid, substantial construction.  It's heavy, but in a good way.So after I used my G613 for awhile, I really was loving it and raving about it.  My wife was looking longingly at it, so I gave it to her and got another one for me.She loves the key actuation, as much as I do.  She also has commented on the obvious high-quality construction and materials.  And, she really likes the way it looks.  She loves the spacing and feel of the ten-key pad.Everything that seems to make this a good gaming keyboard makes it a superb office keyboard that gets constant use, day in and day out.  I really feel that Logitech should take the G613, remove the \"G\" keys and with NO other changes make it the K613.  Keep the Lightspeed connectivity and the Bluetooth capability.In my case, I discovered the G613 by accident.  I was ready to pull the trigger on the K840, but I was really hesitating because it was corded and I don't want cords on my desk.  I did a search on Amazon for a Logitech wireless mechanical keyboard and the G613 came up!  If I stayed on Logitech's website I would never have found it, for I would never have gone to the gaming section of their site.Though categorized as a gaming keyboard, it doesn't look like one.  I was relieved to see that it was not a flashy design and didn't have the pachinko palace (garish in my eyes) lighting.  This is a mature, professional, elegantly designed keyboard.  I truly believe that it is mis-marketed.This is NOT a membrane keyboard.  It uses Romer-g black switches, which are very precise and smooth in their action.After I installed the firmware update, there has been no delay in typing upon waking.I wholeheartedly recommend the G613!  So does my bookkeeper wife!",
          "I'm impressed with this keyboard so far!I got this to replace my Logitech G19 because it ticked all the following requirements:-----------------------------------------------------------------Supported on linux by solaar (debian in my case) CHECKWireless  CHECKDedicated macro keys  DOUBLE CHECKNow for the bonus round: It has mechanical switches!!----------------------------------------------------------------The mechanical switches were definitely second to the dedicated macro keys for my use case, but after I used it for a while, but I really like these switches! Hopefully they will last a while before I have to bust out the soldering station and replace the most frequently used ones...Now for the cons:I had two main issues/complaints, but one of my issues has resolved itself. Out of the box though.  For some reason the 'K' and 'J' keys doing unwanted keystrokes, but I still don't know if it was just my habit of resting my fingers on the keys a little too heavily since I was coming from the rubber dome switches of the G19, or if these just needed a few hundred presses to  get through the initial break-in period. In any case the issue has resolved itself. My second complaint is the lack of onboard memory! Even my ancient G602 mouse has onboard memory that allows me to program the extra buttons and use the device without Logitech Gaming Software (Don't even THINK about that G-hub crap... I'd stick to the older better software if I ever need to use windows for anything. Unless of course you have a newer mouse or something that's not supported by LGS)If I get angry and break it over my knee I'd order another right away! haha I kid I kid...You can't go wrong unless you're one of those weird left handed mouse users and don't need or plan to use the extremely useful and convenient macro keys for increased productivity and fast actions in games. BTW I can say that wince I write and use silverware etc. with my left hand... but if you use a mouse with your left hand you're doing it wrong! Just aayin...  :DThese screenshots are how I set up solaar to make use of the macro keys. This does work well, but I'm not sure if my solution is the best way to set it up since the documentation for solaar is lacking in a big way, but this does work to seamlessly execute scripts, even in full-screen applications. When keystrokes with specific delays are needed for a macro I use a utility called 'xdotool' to accomplish the task. Again, there are likely easier ways that I missed....",
          "Update:I've had this thing for about a year now, and it has grown on me. It's not as bulky as the old G710 I was using before. Pretty much the perfect keyboard for someone who writes and plays video games on separate computers. I can type all day and it feels great. Also I still haven't changed the battery, and I use this thing every day, sometimes for long gaming sessions.---Of all the full-sized bluetooth mechanical keyboards in its price range, this is the only one I could find. So cheers to logitech for that.I needed a wireless keyboard that I could easily share between two computers, and I needed a number pad. There were other mechanicals that don't have a numpad or, worse, have the keys all bunched together like someone desperately needs their keyboard to fit in the tiniest space possible. Typing experience is decent. I preferred the feel of the keycaps on my old G710 plus, but I'm able to type just as fast on this one. Stylistically, it looks nicer and more professional than most 'gaming' keyboards out there, so points for that. Kinda retro looking.I did have to install and launch the GHub app on mac in order to get the system to recognize the keyboard, but I don't have to keep launching it after that.Pros:-affordable-easy to switch between two computers if you don't mind one of them using the dongle and one of them using bluetooth.-looks nice-decent typing-lightspeed works well for gamingCons:-bare bones -- could be a pro or con depending on your needs, but the lack of a num lock indicator light seems a bit overly skimpy. but, gotta save battery life, am I right?-uses regular batteries instead of having a built-in rechargeable battery, which would have allowed them to cut fewer corners on things like number lock and backlit keys.-volume buttons?! whose idea was that? put a wheel on it or why even bother having media controls.-hollow springy sound that rings through the night when you press keys too hard-can't connect more than 2 devicesOverall, it does what I need, but I'm not exactly geeking out over it.",
          "Bit of background of my keyboards: one with knock off Cherry MX Red (Linear) and one with knock off Cherry MX Green (Clicky)My use case:Programming and gamingGaming level: Casual (Platinum Tank/Support in Overwatch)Nowhere on the product page could I find if these Romer-G's were of the Linear or Tactile type. Reviews were going either way and I can see why. While it does have a tactile bump, it is so easy to miss on most of the keys, I sometimes felt I was using linear switches. I say most of the keys because some of the bumps are much more defined, but it isn't in certain areas. For example, the \"bumpiest\" keys are the \"5/%\" in the Number Row and the \"J\" but the \"2/@\" and the others between the \"F\"-\"L\" are pretty much linear. These being Romer-G's, they can't be replaced or moved, so if you don't like where your bumpier keys are, you are out of luck.Next, the sound. Coming from pseudo-Cherry MX Greens, these were definitely quieter. But that isn't saying much when the comparison has one designed to make noise. The Logitech G613 has a weird twang to it too. If you hit one key moderately hard (just above normal typing pressure), you'll hear this weird echoing sound that can be heard over the sound of you typing. The spacebar makes this noise no matter how hard it is hit. Plus they have this weird feel to them that I can only describe as powdery. The feel isn't smooth and feels like it's full of static (not electrical, just the fuzzy white and black screen), almost reminiscent of membrane keys.Some good qualities of the keyboard are its build qualities and features. With very minimal deck flex, it feels like a quality product. It isn't particularly heavy or light, right in the sweet spot. The integrated wrist mount for ergonomics is a nice touch, but it's hard and can't be replaced. The included media keys and macro buttons are good and do their job. Logitech's software, when it works, is awesome and checks nearly every box. In-game, I couldn't tell the difference between the lightspeed mode and a wired keyboard, similar to their lightspeed mouses. I can NOT attest to the battery life, in either the gaming or battery saver mode, as I did not keep it long enough for my batteries to die out. (That said, the included batteries lasted a whole 5 minutes in the default mode.)TLDR Pros and Cons:Pros:Indistinquisible from wired to an average gamer (Platinum in Overwatch)Good build qualityFully programmable Macro keysSoftware is great, especially if you have a Logitech mouseCons:Bad switches, some are practically linear and others are definitely tactileSwitch quality/tactile-ness is sporadicNo backlightingWrist mount is not removable/changeableHollow twang sound when typingIncluded batteries are a jokeRecommended?No. Either buy a cheap keyboard and upgrade later, or just buy a better keyboard right off the bat. You'll probably have it for at least a year or two, might as well make it one you like.",
          "I love this keyboard for the most part. It does exactly what I wanted... a quick and easy way to switch between my work laptop and my home gaming PC. Laptop uses Bluetooth. PC uses the dongle. Keys to switch are right up top and easily accessible. I like the size. Lots of people prefer compact keyboards but not me. I did get one that died within 2 months but the replacement has been solid so I bought a second one I keep at my parents place for when I visit (not superbly mobile because of it's size). Anyway, my only irritation is that the letters have seriously worn off for me, especially around the keys for gaming. My left control key has no label, shift is almost gone, A is gone and a few others have gotten flaky. I knew this wasn't backlit and I really wouldn't expect that for a wireless keyboard, but I would have expected better quality on the keys. It's enough of a quality issue (to me) that I can't really recommend this keyboard no matter how well it technically serves my setup.",

There is a sheen to a few keys but the quality is amazing. Not a single dead key. I love the button for quick swapping from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi as well. It comes with a phone stand so I\u2019ve got my phone propped up connected to Bluetooth and will use my keyboard to quick respond to a text and then swap back over to 2.4 Wi-Fi and work!

Aside from the volume of the keys - a great feature pre-pandemic-perma-lockdown and problematic in remote-work-culture - everything with this board was great. But standard. The left-hand keys (G1-G6) while they can be mapped, don't really offer anything of additional value. And the volume keys and controls (upper right) can only control your whole system, not individual applications' output. Probably the most important cautionary tales: After about 13 months of 10+ hours/day constant usage, the printing on the keys weathers away (\"Where are my A, S, D, W keys, now!?\" ~No gamer, ever, but anyone else using this keyboard, definitely). And most importantly: the keys' sensitivity becomes too great after about 15 months. Here's an example without me correcting spelling, just straight typing: Thhe last three I've been sstrruuggling to corrrect every sentence thhaat I manaage to type out because sosme of thhe keyss will douuble hhiit or not hit at all aand the timie it takkes to ggo back aand change everythhing, or even to cclick everythhing to auutocorrrect takes smore timie than it iis even wororthh. Cuurrentllyy in the market forr a new keyboarrd and in cconsidiierinig repurrchaassinig thiis iitem (whhiich Ii won't) it seems apprropriiate to lleave thhe cautiioonary talless for those in the market for a keyboard moreo thhan every 2-3 yearss.(Back to normal corrections...) Cleaning the board is super easy and nothing special or unique, the same amount of beard and dog hair will wrap around theses keys like any othher.",
          "The keys on this keyboard feel great!  They don't drag and don't feel mushy, nor are my fingers slipping and sliding off of them hitting other keys when I'm typing at speed.  They've got that tactile responsive feel without the loud clickiness allowing me to type quickly without disturbing my co-workers when we're in meetings.I down-rated ergonomics because I wish keyboard manufacturers (Logitech!) would stop 'deciding' what you need for a wrist-rest.  That really needs to be removable.  Not only does it make fitting the keyboard into my keyboard tray awkward, but it's just hard plastic anyway.  What exactly is the point?",
          "The instant Logitech announced a wireless mechanical keyboard I went nuts because I've been waiting what seemed like forever for one. When I read the release details I was a bit bummed but they were a bit expected.I'll start by saying that I had a couple of reasons I wanted a wireless mechanical keyboard.1) I can't touch type on membranes anymore, my WPM literally tanks at least by 40 because I mispress. So other wireless solutions do not work for me.2) I've wanted to see my desk with no cables for a while, and this is made possible now with the G613 and a G900 combo.3) I use keyboard and mouse on a XIM 4 for console play and this alleviates me needing to have multiple keyboards and moving things around. I just plug the dongles into the XIM 4 and I'm done.4) I also like to use my Steam Link and Shield in my living room. This no cable business makes that a breeze.So by now you're probably wondering, why the 3 stars? Well the keyboard meeting criteria was a good start but it has flaws that are subjective. So I'll go into a Pros and Cons for me personally.Pros:1) Wireless AND mechanical2) Keycaps feel decent (Not that curved weird crap found on the G910)3) off/on switch4) Media keys and G keys5) Wireless AND Bluetooth compatible (more on that later)6) Absolutely no lag while gaming or typing.7) Battery life is phenomenal when other manu's stated it'd be almost impossible8) Plastic used is not very susceptible to sweat or skin oils which is a must for me9) *Subjective* Keyboard has a nice heft to it that feels quality. It doesn't flex like a cheap keyboard and I feel comfortable moving it around.10) Keyboard feet that flip out are sturdy and large for more support and the rubber is very grippy.11) Battery area easily accessible and nice spot to put receiver while moving it around or packing it up.Now for them Cons:1) Upon coming out of standby the keyboard normally misses a key press despite how quick it is.2) I do not like Romer G switches. I have used Cherry switches for so long that I am really accustomed to Browns. RG's feel very mushy in comparison for a typer. Almost membrane like but with more spring to the actuation.3) The built in wrist rest whether necessary for design or not is annoying. I've never used one and it makes the keyboard unnecessarily bulky.4) The media keys are kind of lame. They are big and easy to hit, but I'm not a huge fan of how they feel when pressing, or the feedback from them. I also personally prefer a scroll wheel for volume.5) Although I like the keycaps better than what's on my G710+ I do not like them as much as the keycaps on my CODE.6) Speaking of keycaps, for a $150 (at the time) keyboard you would expect to find something other than printed labels on the caps. I knew this going into my purchase from reviews, but still a bit of a let down.7) It is not backlit at all. This is obviously for battery life, but even though I am not a fan of crazy RGB I would have preferred a subtle white glow to see in the dark while playing games with dark scenes. If I did not have LED strips for ambience I would not really be able to see the keys while gaming at night unless I turned the light on.8) There is a caps lock light but NOT a Num lock light. Not real sure why, but I prefer to have it as I do use the numpad.9) As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, nothing negative on the physical keyboard aspect but if I wasn't previously experienced on making macros with LGS It'd be a nightmare. There's a lot of functionality there but the execution could be better.10) And finally a small but not really a deal breaker jab, why dark grey? I would have preferred a black keyboard.Now if you're still reading, you the real MVP. Going back to where I mentioned Bluetooth, the fact that this also doubles as a Bluetooth keyboard blew me away. It's almost a one size fits all for my personal use. Switching between wireless and Bluetooth is a breeze and it connects immediately to the device I want to type on. Be it my iPhone, Android phone, laptop, tablet, Shield, PS4 Pro, whatever. Just hit the Bluetooth button and start typing. Because of this, because of the Pros, and despite the cons I use this keyboard everyday for almost everything. I almost want a second one for work so I don't need to try and squeeze this thing in my backpack.3 stars and a slew of cons but don't take me the wrong way. For a \"first iteration\" from Logitech it's a really really solid keyboard. If they actually do wind up addressing some of my subjective views I would definitely be purchasing a G613+ or whatever it might be. I would have one at work, at home, and a 10 keyless one for my stream PC would be awesome too.",
          "This keyboard is an amazing keyboard. I love the way the keys sound when you press them. I love that it\u2019s wireless so I can sit back with my feet up and still use the keyboard. I like the weight and it being hefty enough to feel like a good keyboard but not too heavy to hold comfortably on your lap. This thing would have been the keyboard of my dreams! \u2026 if it was rechargeable. It takes batteries, which I skimmed over when I bought it. This would have been so amazing if you could have recharged it. I know that rechargeable batters deteriorate, but batteries are so expensive these days.It not like you don\u2019t get a decent charge out of the batteries. I\u2019ve had my keyboard and used it daily for a few weeks now and the charge isn\u2019t even half way yet. The keyboard goes to sleep on its own when you don\u2019t use it for about a minute. But I still don\u2019t see why you guys couldn\u2019t have tried to make it rechargeable\u2026 so sad.",
          "Like so many others, I had this keyboard about 6 months and loved it. Suddenly, it started typing letters twice. I thought it was something wrong with my hands or because I type very fast, but I realized this wasn't a problem on other keyboards in the office. Fortunately Logitech stands behind their products and provided a free replacement which is great because this really is my favorite keyboard I've ever owned. The weight of the keys and fact that it easily connects to multiple PCs by switching from bluetooth to wireless is a huge help and not easy to find in other products.",
          "I bought this keyboard because I was looking for a wireless mechanical keyboard. My desk very small and I'm trying to reduce clutter and cables all over the place. I have a wireless mouse and an external monitor that connects to my laptop via a single USB-C. The wireless keyboard I was using before wasnt really good at all, and I wanted the mechanical switches. I am NOT a gamer, but I do like to play extremely casual games every now and then for leisure.This keyboard doesnt have the greatest mechanical switches. They arent the Cherry Red or Blue MX switches that most people want and love. But obviously for this price range, I knew what I was getting. These Romer G switches are kind of \"heavy\". I would say they take about an average-to-slightly about average amount of force to actuate each switch. Overall, the switches for my purposes (mostly text documents, Excel, Word, online forums) do just fine and they do feel better than a normal non-mechanical keyboard. There are media hotkeys in the top right corner, capslock and battery light indicator, buttons to switch to bluetooth or receiver mode. A lot of people in reviews complained about the feeling of the media keys. While I agree they are pretty lame feeling buttons.....how often are you pressing them? To adjust volume and mute every now and then, you dont need super high quality keys. I think they are just fine for the function. The gaming special keys as well (G1-G6) are probably helpful if youre a gamer. I wouldnt know. But in Adobe Premier, I have already programmed a couple of them and they have turned out to be pretty helpful. I just need to get used to where the ESC and G1 keys are. They are right next to each other and very often when I want to press ESC, I accidentally press G1. Thats kind of annoying. If you want the super fast lighter switches of Cherry Red, Blue or even Brown, then obviously you need to spend more. As Im writing this review, the price of this keyboard is now $89.90. I guess I got a steal because I bought this when it was $59.99 and I didn't even realize that was a discounted price. If you can find it at a similar price that I bought it, then definitely go for it. Keep in mind this keyboard has no backlighting or RGB. If it had just a single white backlight that wouldve been much appreciated but oh well. Around $90 I'd probably just look for those $110-120 keyboards because theyll have better switches and backlight but may not be wireless.Wirelessness: This is the main reason I got this keyboard. Ive noticed no significant lag when working. But again, Im not a gamer so I cant comment on its performance for that. I use bluetooth because I like keeping my USB ports open. So far the keyboard connects quickly and seemlessly when I turn it on. Never have had it drop connection. I have no problems there. The wirelessness of this keyboard gets a 5 out of 5. It also has an easy ON/OFF switch on the side thats great for saving battery if you remember to turn it off (which I quite often do)Materials: Its all made of plastic but it feels extremely sturdy and is quite heavy. Sweaty palms and oil stains have yet to show up on this (about a month of use so far). Quality is just fine there and the matte black and grey colors are good if you need to use this in a business setting. No obnoxious red accents or anything.The biggest critique or annoyance I have with this keyboard is the NONREMOVABLE palm rest. I appreciate that its included with the keyboard, but couldnt they make it removable? Especially if youre like me and already have a palm rest that you enjoy using and when youre feeling like it....enjoy NOT using. Sometimes I dont want the palm rest. The fact the palm rest is stuck to this thing is quite a bummer. It doesnt ruin my experience with the keyboard but it does make me kind of annoyed when Im moving it around or want to use it without it. It adds unnecessary heft and size. Like I said, my desk is already small, and this keyboard takes up a huge space because of the stuck-on palm rest.OVERALL: If you dont mind the attached palm rest and if youre like me and dont really care for RGB backlit or super fast Cherry switches, and you just want a quality wireless mechanical keyboard that stays connected, performs well, and looks good for your at-home setup as well as at work, this is a great buy if you can find it for under $80ish. I do recommend this keyboard as long as you know what to expect when you bought it. I did my research and comparisons of a bunch of keyboards and am happy with my purchase. I knew the palm rest wasnt removable to begin with, but it is still annoying they couldnt just easily make it detachable. Good keyboard 4/5",
          "If you are looking for a wireless gaming keyboard this is a great option.Pro:Wireless via the dongle works perfectly with no latencyExcellent battery lifeHas a wrist restN-key rollover(press as many keys as you need at once without it freaking out)Dedicated on/off switchHas dedicated volume controlsMechanical, so I guess it is better? I honestly don't mind non-mechanical though...Takes regular batteries, this could be a con if you wanted a rechargable though; I prefer the simplicity, no charging cable and don't need to plug it in. Especially since the battery life is amazing.Con:It's huge, partly because of the numberpad but also the macro keys on the left. I can live with the numberpad but really don't care for those macro keysThe switches are supposed to be tactile but honestly there is almost no tactile bump and it is so close to the end of the travel that the switches almost feel linear just with a higher actuation force. Also, the spring back is somewhat weak giving it a mushy feeling. For gaming this isn't a big deal, but I wouldn't recommend this keyboard for extended typing.The wrist rest is plastic, not a big deal but a more cushiony material that expanded up more but can be compressed would have been preferred.No lighting, I don't care but for someone who plays in the dark it may be a dealbreakerIt is not an ergonomic keyboard, this of course is highly subjective; most people are fine with the straight keyboards, I personally love the microsoft ergonomic keyboard(and its predecessors the natural keyboard elite, etc)Overall this is one of the only reasonably priced wireless gaming keyboards with a wrist rest. Most people should be fine with it, but if you need tactile switches you may want to look elsewhere.",
          "I love the looks and feel of the keyboard.  Mechanically it seems very solid.  However, after about 6 months the characters started to come off of the keys and now after 8 months, several of the keys are partially or completely blank.  There should have been some kind of embossing.",
          "I like the look and the features of this keyboard battery life is good as well but the sounds the keys make are not my cup of tea you could say. I like everything else but any time I have to type more than a few works I really don't enjoy it.",
          "I mostly use my PC for Photoshop and Lightroom. Bought this because CTRL key quit working smoothly on my $25 Logitech membrane style keyboard. The responsiveness is great and the subtle clicky mechanical feedback is great. The only complaint I have is the gaming function keys on the left side seem a little close to the QWERTY part of the keyboard and I keep hitting them accidentally while reaching for the CTRL key with my pinky. Strangely enough, with the default software and no changes by me this kicks off some Photoshop action automatically which I then have to use the undo key combo to undo. Not the end of the world but would prefer these to have no function unless programmed by me. That being said, too busy to take a break and figure it out. Nonetheless I am confident that issue can be resolved with a little research. If not for that it's a 5/5.",
          "It will take some getting used to having the G keys on the side as I keep accidentally hitting G1 instead of escape or alt+G3 instead of alt tab. I think I will be happy with this keyboard once the muscle memory kicks in. I read about double clicking issues after a year or so so we will see.I use this for general use and gaming and so far have had no issues with it. The phone stand that comes with it is a nice touch since you can pair it with this keyboard and swap between your PC and phone with 1 button. I like swapping to bluetooth to send texts with a full size keyboard. This is my first wireless gaming keyboard because I was trying to find 1 that takes AA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery.I prefer replacing 2 batteries instead of having to charge it every few days and I read the battery life on this thing is phenomenal. I have a nice set of rechargeable AA batteries that I use for my mouse and now keyboard. My desk is so much cleaner now that I eliminated cables from my mouse and keyboard (I got the new naga hyperspeed that also takes a AA battery)The media keys do feel cheap but they get the job done. I would have preferred a scroll wheel for the volume like on my last keyboard. And I would love this keyboard to be backlit but I understand why they didn't to improve battery life and keep cost down. I would not pay full price for this keyboard but I think it's a steal at the $65 I paid.",
          "This keyboard is great. Probably the \u201cclickiest\u201d I will go as far as switches go. Even though I hate clicky switches, I love the Romer-G tactiles. Sort of like a Gateron Brown but with much more force in the tactility. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people into mechs hate romer g feels but I enjoy it.The for factor is a standard full layout. I get that it is a gaming keyboard, but kind of becomes oversized with the added G keys that I hardly use. Could be of use to others. I enjoy the ability to swap between Bluetooth and 2.4ghz. Made it easy to use my personal computer and work computer since I work from home. Bluetooth does take a few seconds to become recognized when swapping but 2.4ghz is instant.The 1 issue I\u2019ve had is the L key became stuck after about 5 months. I attempted to open it and see if I can fix it but realized I\u2019m SOL because I have no idea how to work with romer-g switches. Just trying to put the cap back on I broke some brackets which ended up having the top half of the switch stuck to the key cap. I would rate this much lower if I was stuck with this keyboard and no solution but the Logitech Support team got another whole brand new G613 back to me as soon as they had them back in stock. I couldn\u2019t believe how simple they made the process. Send them a few pics, the serial number, and what the issue is and they said they\u2019ll replace the whole unit and no need to send the keyboard back.Although I don\u2019t use this as my personal driver I will always make the G613 my work keyboard. the wrist rest and key cap shape helps me type for long periods of time with minimal error. Highly recommend.",
          "I'm writing this after 6 months of heavy use primarily as a productivity keyboard. The 6 shortcuts keys, which become 12 with using G-Shift on my Logitech G604 mouse are great. Cleaning the keyboard of dust is a piece of cake: just carefully remove the keycaps and dust it. Lightspeed and Bluetooth connectivity is great since I can use one keyboard with my personal and work computers.Negatives:- No onboard memory. It's a $130 MSRP keyboard with plenty of circuitry space. G604 mouse, which is smaller has onboard memory for button profiles, and the keyboard doesn't.-The plastic on keycaps wears out. This is supposed to be a heavy duty keyboard but the buttons I use the most frequently are all polished after 6 months.- Heavy & loud. This is a mechanical keyboard so these \"issues\" are expected, but 3lbs. (almost 1.5kg) seems a bit excessive.- No num lock indicator. I realize that an always-on LED would eat into the battery life, but there is no software indicator either. Given how sensitive the gaming keys are, I often bump the num lock key when using the media keys and wonder why I can't type numbers in Excel.",
          "Alright, so I've had this thing since February 13th, 2020 according to my Amazon purchase history. The first year with it was great, I had all kinds of macros set up for gaming shortcuts, the software worked well even though I had to look for and install the G Hub just for this keyboard, and I had no further issues. I was a happy customer at the time. Fast forward one year, I'm getting unresponsive keys that need to be pressed multiple times before it finally registers. This issue seemed to come and go at random times. Nothing was stuck under the keys, I pulled them all off to remove debris. Despite this, I shrugged it off as an oddity. Two years after that, the keyboard is practically non-functional! Keys are going lengthy periods of time being unresponsive or too responsive (multiple characters per press) and flipping back and forth between those two states with no inbetween. It's a hassle to type even the shortest sentences to anyone.That's why I'm writing this review with another keyboard, an old and basic Y-UY95 Logitech keyboard. It has no special functions other than a media bar, but it does what a keyboard needs to do at a far cheaper price. Anyways, I don't recommend the G613 for only lasting me 2 years, almost 3. The first year was excellent, and I would highly recommend it had it kept that performance for at least a few years more, but also maybe I spend too much time on my computer and ran this thing's life short.",
          "I have a laptop but I never use the laptop keyboard as it is not comfortable to me. I love this keyboard and I have had many in the past. The palm rest is perfect (as I usually have my keyboard on my lap) and I was thrilled with the weight of the keyboard. It is very sturdy. The fact that there is no cord (to charge) and has a battery along with bluetooth makes it just that much better. The touch on the keyboard is light and works perfectly for me. I used to have the Logitech 800 with backlit keys but I have to say I don't miss it at all! I cannot say enough about how great this keyboard is. I have a second laptop coming and believe that I will be able to link this keyboard to both laptops which will be so much easier! Everyday that I use my new keyboard I fall more in love with it!"

          "The KB itself is pretty decent, if ultimately unimpressive in any way compared to competition. Its mainly impressive in the fact that I paid ~$80 for it, and it still works, where as a $200 KB from the same company couldnt avoid double typing letters on day 1 / minute one purchase.the software, which both KBs share, is atrocious. Its easy to use and the UI is solid, and that is where the good parts about it end. i recommend googling 2 things before considering ANY logitech product, in particular KBs- first, \"Logitech G Hub\", secondly, \"Logitech keyboard double typing\", and you can educate yourself and make your own further decisions.my two cents, however: The software quiet quits on you and renders some of the KB functions utterly useless. I joined a game, only to be unable to do certain things. I try to toggle the game mode button on the KB? No dice, just doesn't do anything. It wouldnt let me trigger windows snipping tool either, which is what I usually use for a quick screenshot in a game. I actually assumed it was my computer itself causing the issue first.I exit the game, and notice that I actually cant get the KB to do anything besides type basically. None of the special or function keys worked. It was early and I wasn't thinking \"gee golly, maybe my KB crashed\". I go to restart windows and it pops up an error exception for Logitech G Hub during the restart process. I frankly should have known because the software has been nothing but a hassle since I got it. I'm almost embarrassed i didnt assume it was that first.I can say with sadness & truth that theres no price point that I think these boards are worth buying into. I've had boards from basically every competitor with a name that you can buy on this site, and every single competitor beats these boards at all price points- and frankly, you get more features for less money on competitor boards usually.I didn't want this to be the case and I'm not pleased that I have at minimum one return of a logitech board to make, and realistically it should probably be two returns. When it comes to useability I can say with veracity that the baseline mechanical KBs from red dragon et al are equal to or better when it comes to functioning as a KB.These logitech boards do offer some nice features like per key RGB etc- but its reliant on software that will simultaneously render your board useless. I'm apparently one of the lucky ones based on my google searching, since it seems as though that software has caused numerous other headaches for people.",
          "I bought this keyboard because I wanted it to match with my Logitech KDA mouse. I have mixed feelings about it.Pros: The keyboard's case is beautiful; I love its design. Additionally, the keyboard works great for gaming in my experience. The RBG effect is nice and bright (but not too bright that it hurts your eyes).Cons: The keycaps feel very cheap, so I'm not surprised by the other reviews stating that the keycaps fade overtime. Judging by the keycaps' quality, it's a given. Additionally, I think the keyboard that was delivered to me is faulty. My \"i\" key is very inconsistent. Sometimes pressing down on it doesn't register, other times pressing down on it once will register twice. It's frustrating just typing out this review.If you are a keyboard enthusiast, I would not recommend this keyboard. You could just buy a cheaper hot swappable keyboard and modify it to your liking. For people who simply want a plug and play mechanical gaming keyboard, or just like KDA, really think about its faults before buying. From what I understand, it can be difficult to purchase spare keycaps for this keyboard as the bottom row isn't standard layout. Additionally, last I checked; Logitech did not have any spare keycaps in stock for this keyboard. If you do purchase this keyboard, hopefully it isn't faulty like mine is.",

          "I've used Logitech products for years and have gone through four model K740s. Nothing lasts forever, and this includes the K740 (which apparently is no longer available). In desperation, I went with the Logitech G Pro hoping for the best, as a dependable illuminated keyboard for me is a must.Since my previous purchases, the keyboard world has gone nuts over gaming. I didn't fully realize this when I ordered the G Pro. The keyboard I received works well, but has several design flaws and limitations that make it a poor choice for someone who is a programmer and not a gamer.First of all: no numeric keypad. My fault, I should have looked more closely at the images of the keyboard before I purchased.The keyboard illumination is great...if you don't mind the symbol keys (@#$%, etc.) being virtually invisible. You see, only the *primary* key character is illuminated. In order to locate the $, for example, I have had to literally pull out a flashlight! Not only are the shift characters not illuminated, they are printed in a dark gray against the black keys. Virtually invisible to my aging eyes.For reasons known only to Logitech, they also reversed the positioning of the alternate symbols. On standard keyboards, the $ appears above the 4 key, indicating that pressing shift and 4 gives you the dollar sign. With the G Pro, the $ is *below* the 4. This is counter-intuitive and gives me pause each time I have to hunt down the symbol I need at the moment.Unfortunately, the G Pro is being returned and my quest for a better illuminated keyboard continues. Should I find this holy grail, I'll return with an update. I still give the G Pro three stars, as it's probably good in the role for which it was intended. It just doesn't fulfill my needs.",

          "I have the other version of this keyboard with the GX Clicky Blue switches and what feels like non-rubberized keycaps. The keycaps on this this gx brown feels significantly rubberized.I do not really like the GX Brown Tactile keys for one reason only. It has the exact same issue as the mx cherry browns and romer-g browns or any other brown switch, they have barely any tactile feel to them, which practically makes them linear switches in real world usage. If I wanted a linear switch, I would have bought one.Overall, the gx browns are smoother than the gx blues, almost feel like they could be lubed, so the browns are pretty smooth, that part feels nice. If it had actual tactile feedback, this would be a winner. The gx blue switches have the best typing feedback of course, but they are very loud and the gx blue switches also feel not as refined as they could be, it feels somewhat scratchy and loose, I can even feel the parts move inside of the switch when I'm pressing them slowly.I'm very divided honestly and it's frustrating. I want the solid tactile feedback of the gx blues in the gx browns, but the only thing really wrong with them is that they have almost no tactile bump, which is the only reason why I bought them, because I wanted that solid tactile feedback. That's all I want. When you're gaming or typing very fast, you barely notice any bump at all. It just doesn't make any sense why they would make the gx brown switch like a linear. The whole point for each type of switch is to be significantly different from the other for different purposes. It's almost like they're afraid to offend people with too much pronounced tactile bump or something. It's literally the most minimal tactile bump you can possibly design on a switch without it being straight up linear. I didn't buy a linear switch, I bought a tactile, so give me an actual tactile switch.This keyboard could be the right fit if you're looking for something that's affordable on sale and good design overall. The switches will probably not really satisfy you though. To be fair, all mainstream keyboards with pretty much any type of brown switch, they all have the same issue, barely any tactile feedback, which makes them practically a linear.So if you enjoy clicky loud blue keys or if you enjoy the smooth barely any tactile brown switches, this could be the keyboard for you on a budget. I wouldn't recommend them at full price at all, but for the on sale price of $60, yes sir, I'll take one.Personally, I only bought this thing because it was cheap and I would have to pay a lot more money for the type of switch I actually want, so here we are.A good product, I only just have issues with the switches.I personally prefer the gx blue clicky switches.Semi recommended as long as you know what you're getting.",

The GPRO series of peripherals are all top of the line and the keyboard is no different! The sleek design, the keys, the software, and the input are all state of the art. I love the keyboard and will continue purchasing logitech\u2019s products in the future.",
          "This is the keyboard of a League of Legends cringelord, but man it works great. It is really comfortable for gaming, and nicely compact due to the shedding of the number pad.The blue is refreshing, and the lights are bright.It's held up well under some very intense games.I really like it :)",
          "I have a destructive cat. On many occasions, when I left a keyboard uncovered for a while, I would come back to find that kitty had been sitting on the keyboard and had ripped keys out with her rear claws!  The solution came in two parts. (1) a clear, hardened acrylic cover that bridged the whole keyboard (2) this keyboard product.I like the rugged nature of the keyboard. HOWEVER, the key markings that invert the normal character on the key with it\u2019s shifted counterpart are highly confusing, given that I have > 50 years of almost daily use of the traditional arrangement",

          "I love this keyboard.  Early January, I needed a new mechanical keyboard.  On Amazon, first bought an RK keyboard.  After considerable effort to get it to work, some of the keys didn\u2019t.  Returned it and ordered a Velocifire keyboard.  Much more effort to get it to work, and it would work for an hour or half a day or a few minutes, and then off.  Keep charging cord plugged in, or not?  Tried ways to get it to work; not happening, so returned it, too.  Both of those were wireless, so I ordered this Logitech wired keyboard.  Wireless isn\u2019t that important to me.  Plugged cord into dongle and into keyboard on February 1, and it\u2019s been working perfectly since then.  No words to describe how happy I am with this keyboard.  Thank you, Logitech!",
          "I love my custom, clicky, thonky blue mechanical keyboards, but sometimes you need something a bit quieter...I tried reds and hated them for typing - apparently I \"rest\" my fingertips on the keys (more than I should?) and made more typos than usual. I was hoping that the promise of browns (quieter than blues, but with some tactile feedback) would be the solution! Are they?Kinda.... They are definitely quieter than blues which is a low bar to clear, but I wish they had more tactile feedback. I'm not feeling a hint of a click/switch/scrape so they somewhat feel like stronger-springed reds. Either way, this keyboard is better than typing on reds and accomplished my mission of finding something quieter to type on.Bonus - RGB and feel - this really does feel like a quality piece of engineering. It's hefty and sturdy. If you can ignore some of the blatant branding, it's actually pretty nice overall and you can manage all the settings, including RGB, via the Logitech app.  I like how there's a dedicated \"go dark\" button.Negatives - wish there was more key feedback, and I wish the cord wasn't dead center but on the left corner. =)",
          "I liked it so much i bought it twice! Not hot swappable  but feels good and heavy...very good quality. Space bar has a bit of a different sound then the rest of the keyboard but it does what it needs and fits in a backpack for my laptop. The colors are vibrant and if ur a lol fan i think it's a must",
          "I was bummed that this didn't have a braided cable and it still uses a micro USB. Overall it works great and haven't had any issues!",
          "This is a great keyboard. The RGB is bright and does not spill color glare like some pudding keyboards do. The G Pro software is good for making your own lighting profiles. The GK Blue clicky keys are a joy to type/game on. But. The symbols !@#$%^&*()_+}{:\"|?>< are not illuminated. They are painted on. In a dark environment, you cannot see them. Bummer. I would still highly recommend the GPro if this feature is not important.",
          "The keyboard came in perfect condition. The details and gold patterns look beautiful. It feels sturdy/well made and the keys have a satisfying clicking sound. All of the rgb lights work excellent and are bright. Overall very happy with my purchase.",

          "It was about mid-day when I thought to myself, \"I wonder what deals there are today\", and with that I decided to browse for deals. This was a daily ritual, so I wasn't expecting much but then my eyes set its gaze upon a deal so good I couldn't say no for an answer. A Logitech keyboard (League of Legends edition) for 54% off its original price! \"Wow, what a bargain\" I told myself. Without a second thought, I added this keyboard to my cart and browsed its other models and editions to see if this was the only model - sadly it was. Regardless, this $60 keyboard was originally $130 so I could care less about the design. I Eagerly purchased the product and waited for its arrival.On the day of its arrival, I opened the box with care and instantly put the keyboard to use. During it's short use, I experienced what seemed to be a broken \"e\" key. I decided to use this keyboard for work instead. Within a few hours, I had already switched to my previous mechanical keyboard for work. Luck had run out; I got a faulty keyboard.My experience with the keyboard had been pretty good so far, except for the \"e\" key. The brown switches had a premium sound for a pre-built mechanical keyboard and the material felt nice. It was a product I could get used to using. The actuation of the keys required more effort than I had anticipated but this was a new product, I'm willing to stick with it until I build the finger strength needed to use this keyboard effortlessly. The LEDs on the keyboard wasn't too bright. Just enough in my opinion. Keys were of pretty high quality and software to configure RGB on the keys was within expectations.With such high hopes for this product, I asked for a replacement. Similar to all my purchases, I waited eagerly for my product to arrive. The second keyboard came, and I was just ecstatic! Lets put this bad boy to use I told myself. I wasn't a fool this time though. I instantly used this keyboard for work since I had a higher probability of hitting every key. I'm my best QA -smirk-. Every key had worked without fail but I had noticed a small little detail I'm glad I caught early. The LED indicator for keyboard light and game mode wasn't working. After a busy few hours of working, I plugged the keyboard into my PC and to my surprise, it had retained the RGB info I had set for the first keyboard. Good job Logitech, that G Hub came in handy. I fully expected the LED indicators to light up but it didn't. I tinkered with G Hub to see if I could get the LEDs to light up, but it had failed. I couldn't believe it...I had yet again got another faulty keyboard. I thought long and hard about replacing this keyboard one more time and finally came to the conclusion that I would just return the product.Hope this review helps/helped some of you.",
          "It feels amazing. My previous keyboard was Logitech G-something gaming keyboard, but it was over 12 years old, and slowly dying. The lights on the keyboard is bright and fully adjustable without any software. The size and weight are perfect. They added some weight on there so it doesn't feel flimsy or slide around. It's bigger than the Apple mini BT keyboard, but smaller than the traditional keyboard with the 10 keys - it's just the perfect size. I use a KVM switch for both work on my MacBook and gaming on my PC. Now I just need a new mouse. I have a Razer Deathadder mini. The resolution is nice, but I didn't realize it was going to be so small.",
          "The keyboard itself is great. Ghub personalization is easy and capable of doing some really cool things, if you spend the time with it.My favorite keyboard of all time was the 6gV2, but those are discontinued, and this keyboard really reminds me a lot of it, in terms of function and feel.Why 3 stars?If you want this keyboard to do anything other than spew rainbow unicorn vomit waves across the RGBs you will have to use GHub.GHub auto updates have defaulted my profiles on my mouse and keyboard SO many times it's not funny.I don't customize my stuff anymore, because I have done it 10x already, and then GHub updates and ruins everything.You can turn off auto updates to solve this problem, I, however, still cannot bring myself to change stuff back again.Sucks, because everything else about it is 10/10",

Even had the sticker still on the box from return. Which earned it the -1 star( This is for amazon not the product itself)Product = 5 stars / Amazon = 1 star for what they tried to pull.",
          "I have owned several mechanical keyboards over the past 3 years. Ranging from cheap crap like Red Dragon, to consumer stuff like Corsair and Razer, as well as some of the higher end custom boards like the TOFU60 and some KBDfans stuff.For the money, I think you can do SO much better. While I appreciate the RGB quality and the sheer amount of endless RGB customization the GHUB software allows you, that is about the only thing I can rate highly.Construction is not totally terrible for a board built primarily out of plastic. But it is very hollow sounding and does not have much substance to it when typing. Has a nice weight to it and the adjustable angle stands are nice and have been useful. Stabilizers are average, but definitely nothing special. Why are they STILL using MICRO USB? It literally would cost them less than $0.30 to use USB-C instead. I dont get it. Keycaps dont seem to be double shot PBT, but theyre decent quality nonetheless. Nice RGB shine through. Switches are proprietary Logitech Blue clicky switches. They are pretty meh. If you like the sound of a loud dry keypress with significant amount of travel and play, then youll like it. Otherwise, if youve used boards that have a more consistent and overall smooth feeling keypress, this will not be a treat to use.I think this keyboard is half decent for most folks who want something they can buy once and not have to think about again after that. But if you have very high standards, have used modded or custom or just better quality keyboards prior, this one will very likely not be a great experience.Personally, I went out on a limb because I finished building my latest PC much quicker than I anticipated and have since sold the TOFU60 I had and my backup board which was a Corsair. So I bought this on a whim wanting to give a GPRO product a try. However after a month of use, I am going to revert to building a good starter 60% or maybe TKL mechanical keyboard since that can be done for under 150 and overall can feel 10 times better than this GPRO. :lTLDR6/10. Would recommend to people wanting something that they dont have to worry about ever again after purchasing. Anyone else, I would suggest taking a pass and getting an entry level custom starter board that has intent to be modded down the road.",
          "My general opinion is that this is a decent keyboard. It looks cool, the colors are very bright, and it's sturdy. However, I came across a couple problems. First of all, the keyboard was completely missing a cord when I got it. Second, the Shift and A keys were chipped on the black covering, as seen in the photo. The keys feel kind of weird to press, almost like I have to strain my hands just to press them. They just feel dry and harder to press down on than other keyboards I've used.Just be aware that there's a chance you'll received a messed up product.",
          "This is the first good keyboard in my entire life, it's a little expensive, even though the materials are really great, also its RGB is amazing and too useful. At least for me, this is a very comfortable and premium product as well, love it.",
          "I got the G pro K/DA keyboard and it's going strong. I've had it for a year now and not one of the keycaps is wearing away, so I'm not sure if anyone who is having that problem uses products on their hands right before using it, like oils or anything similar. I recommend taking off your keycaps once in a while to clean your keyboard just like you would clean the inside of your desktop. I recommend searching for safe products to use so nothing becomes worn down. The keycaps come off easily if you want to switch them, just make sure you buy the correct sized caps for this one as many keyboards have different-sized spacebars and whatnot.For those who are interested in changing the lighting and key assignments, downloading \"Logitech G Hub\" will help you immensely, especially when using the gaming button on the top right. This keyboard did not connect to my Omen Gaming Hub like every other thing I use did except my Logitech mouse.Overall, it's a great keyboard for me and I would recommend it to others. The clicky-clacky sound is fun too.",
          "First, I'll agree with every 5 star review out there.  This keyboard is amazing.  That being said, I'll state that the keyboard was not purchased for gaming.  I use it for typing in a home office environment.  I love everything about this keyboard but one small detail I'm finding to be incredibly annoying.  So much so, I'm surprised more reviewers don't it out.The keycaps illuminate, which is great!  All except the shift characters are NOT illuminated.  Lights down low and you're looking for the '&' symbol?  Better turn on the lights.  The RGB on the keyboard is completely useless for any of the shift characters.  This sounds like a small gripe, but it's huge if you wish to use this keyboard for general typing in a low light environment.  For that defeature alone I do NOT recommend this keyboard for home office users that do more than game.Still, I give this keyboard a 4/5 rating.  It's a 5/5 rating if you never have need for illuminated shift characters.  If you do need a full set of visual characters in a low light environment, then this keyboard will feel more like a 2/5 rating.  It's extremely limiting for that usage.Overall, I do NOT recommend this keyboard for those wanting a duel purpose gaming/office keyboard.",
          "The keyboard itself is a great quality, has great switches and the length is perfect for me.HOWEVER, this keyboard is TALL. Over time, it has caused me to develop \u201cGolfer\u2019s Elbow\u201d as a result of bending my hand up so far to reach the WASD keys while gaming. I have never had this issue prior to using this board. My tendons feel like they are on fire whenever I game on it now.",
          "Bough it for office work as I got tired of cheap keyboards. This keyboard is compact and well made, extremely responsive (as a gaming keyboard). Very pleasant for writing long texts. I think I love Logitech keyboards in general.",
          "-First things first I have never ever written a review before so this is my first time writing a review for something, now I'll just keep it short and simple.*Pros*1. Great keyboard for it's price, honestly. You have the limited edition KDA design that goes with it instead of that boring black design you get originally with the \"Logitech G Pro keyboard.\"2. Second factor is the BROWN SWITCHES. Absolutely no sounds and not loud at all, you can game at night with people sleeping and it won't make those loud noises like those blue switches.3. You have the RGB that goes really well with it and super customizable, you get to customize the colors and set different themes for the keyboard such as the one I use \"ocean wave\" or even the \"lightning\" they added.4. Bottom grips to keep it from sliding back and forth on your desk and 4 different types of stands to fit how your hand would feel when setting them down on your gaming mat OR just your hand in general on your table.*Cons?*-Honestly there's nothing bad about the keyboard, the only thing that caught me off guard was and don't take me 100% on this but I think they switches are not LUBED. In the keyboard community lubing a keyboard is always nice to do or have, it makes it so you have SMOOTH clicks no rattling sounds or such. Maybe I am wrong about this but I'm pretty sure they don't come lubed or maybe they do but with a SUPER SMALL amount of lube.*Overall?*-Love it, don't regret spending the 130$ for this keyboard, I play League Of Legends so this is the perfect fit for my gaming set up. If you don't have a keyboard in mind and want to get one or just in general want to get a new keyboard I do recommend trying this one out and see if it fits your taste.",

          "I've gone thru Red dragon, Blackweb, Corsair, Steel Series and HyperX and only HyperX and Corsair came close to the build quality and but honestly they just don't compare, I have big hands and I don't feel like I fumble my key strokes, the keyboard itself is just slightly bigger to wear it forms and fits my hands perfectly while still keeping the small TKL Style, and honestly I'm mad I didn't just spend the money earlier, Logitech got a fan for life now. I should have known since I use their G502 Hero.",
          "I use this product for gaming and so far it is the best keyboard I have bought. I was kind of sketchy with the price but I would definitely buy it again if I went back in time.",
          "It's a nice tenkeyless at a good price. It has comfortable switches, an over-abundance of lighting features, and it has a nice weighty, if plastic, feel.I didn't buy it because I liked League of Legends (don't know what that is) but I do like it as a nice Logitech Tenkeyless that isn't $200. It works fine on linux using the g810-led tool. The cable isn't braided... or if it is, it's underneath the rubber. (It's not like the G512's cables, but I do like the detachable feature.)It's probably going to take me a few days to get used to the action on this keyboard, but so far, it's not been completely alien.  As for gaming, as long as your nethackrc doesn't have the numeric keypad enabled, you'll be fine. :)",

Previous keyboards I use have quick tabs for like 25/50/75/100% this one you would have to go into the software and adjust brightness but even all the way up it doesn\u2019t seem bright but that\u2019s the least of real concerns it works great and that\u2019s all that really matters. Quiet mechanical brown keys too feels very quality made when using it.",
          "It's a good keyboard. After 11 months of use however, the coating on the keycaps is coming off. It doesn't affect the function, but looks awful. For the price, I expected better or at lease the ability to buy replacements. If anyone knows where to get replacements, please let me know."

The keyboard has a built in power plug which will disturb some users, but the cord is braided and long enough to reach far pc's. overall a good mechanical keyboard, little on the pricier side but worth it for a quality built keyboard.",
          "Ok I got one of these from Walmart a few years ago figuring if I was going into game design I would want a gaming keyboard to keep up with what ever game I ended up making. Well so time later I ended up working on blender to relax but by then my stomach was not feeling good and I was a mess. I took a drink of water and, well it came right back up.. it was all over my keyboard and try as I might me and my mom cleaned it the best we could. Go's to say it was a little worse for ware from than but it has served me well for some time. Any ways it was time for me to get another keyboard and due to how well the one I've been useing has worked I figured I should get another one. Belive it or not this keyboard can go through quite some bit and still keep kicking. Would recommend if you want a keyboard to last for 5 or more years with out worry. Feels good to..",
          "I was a little skeptical of dropping $50 onto a keyboard as I usually pay the least amount possible :-) and I wear my keyboards down because I'm a mouse/keyboard gamer + do a full time job using the same keyboard. 2 years in my old wireless logitech keyboard was giving up, the mouse that came with it lasted little to no time and was replaced by a mid-range gaming mouse. Just way more accurate to use.This G413 takes a little bit of getting used to. My old keyboard space key wasn't working that well and leaving wordstogether like this all over my emails pretty annoying having to go back and separate. I'm a hen pecker and can type really quickly without looking and found when I started using the G413 I was misclicking the neighboring key. 2 days later after using over the weekend I'm finding I'm acclimating away from the lower profile less extruded keys to this very raised profile. Its very clicky and tactile but in a good way. I can definitely see the appeal.I was skeptical of the backlighting in red, but last night late on its very useful and I like this a lot.I would recommend this.",
          "THIRD try typing this review! Now down to 2 stars, was going to give it 3. See below for why that is.I agree with Bryan's review - be prepared to save drafts often..and this is NOT \"user error\" as suggested in one comment.Bit of background: as I get older, I get more frustrated with typing in complex passwords over and over (and over) - I'm a very fast, 'old school' typist, and really miss the good ol' days of beastly keyboards. (Best EVER was a zenith (!!) keyboard from their brief foray into backplane PCs in the late 80s..that thing was a joy to use, and must've weighed 10lbs or more, and really tanklike, but was super fast, and accurate...even the cyborg doesn't come anywhere close to it.)So  n-key rollover and key precision is important to me.Also, bright backlighting is a must for low light/fast night work...esp as my eyes age and need brighter lighting, esp at oblique angles.I really like my previous kb, a logitech 820, but it was getting old and cruddy, the backlighting was kind of weak, and didn't seem as 'fast'.I also have a saitek cyborg kb (also ancient now), which I mostly like, but takes up a huge amount of desk space, and could also have brighter backlighting...but keystroke wise it is excellent.I want to replace my old logitech 820 with something newer, brighter, and faster responding (n-key rollover), and it seemed this would be a great choice, after looking for a year or so.The Good & Great:- Bright bright backlighting. I might have preferred white leds (for the black version), but red is fine, maybe even better at night. And it's dimmable, too! And, the legends are very easy to read even from oblique angles (a problem with the old 820)...good job on that, logitech!- The size seems ideal...the key spacing is exactly the same as the big cyborg, but this takes up about 1/3rd less space.- Design - such that it is. Very nice looking, minimalist...even Kool.- Key action (by itself) is fine, and seems to be capable of very fast typing speeds.- DL'd software is nice, as it adds macro support (and other stuff).- Very sturdy, seems well built and solid. I really like the metal base, and hard-to-accidentally-unfold feet at the back...someone finally got that right!THe BAD:- This is a very noisy and 'boingey' sounding kbd...it'd drive me nuts in an nearby work/cube situation. Not an issue for me at home, so FYI.  Would be great for those who want to impress their bosses with how 'busy' they are, though....(yah, we KNOW who y'all are:)- As mentioned, the keys do activate towards the top of their travel, which is fine, even nice (fast).BUT, they also have a bit of wiggle to them at the top of that travel, which makes it very vulnerable to inadvertant sideways brushes or slightly off-center adjacent strikes.. For me, this is a FAIL, as it happens quite frequently. (To be more precise, you can activate a key hit by just lightly swiping the top of a key sideways, with little or no downward pressure.)This is most notable when moving back and forth from the mouse, keypad or arrow keys, when I frequently brush the tops of other keys on the fly.This causes weird things to happen, most often 'escapes' out of the editing page I'm on, usually causing me to lose all my work (or even worse yet, jumping to another page entirely...definitely won't use this for doing taxes!).I also get 'false' palm strikes on the bottom key row, though thats somewhat less frequent, and I've learned to adapt a bit.(FWIW, my hands are average to 'large' sized, so not super small or super large.)THe result is that I've become more irritated with this keyboard than almost any other I've owned.And it happens so fast I still haven't figured out exactly which keys I'm 'knocking'..but alt/fn/cntl/enter/Win, etc are the most likely culprits.Some of this is because it has no palm rest, and is a moderately thick base (but sturdy) so it's a bit of a stretch to the top of the keys from the desk top surface (almost all my other kbds had them...tho the zenith I mentioned above had only a small ledge below the space bar), but the wobbliness at the top of the key 'travel' is the real culprit. A monkey could write a whole book - or review? - by just swiping his fingers lightly across the tops of the keys!Also, since this is for home use, I'm not at a work desk sitting fully upright and looking down at the keyboard; I use it more or less from an almost-reclined desk chair position.For those who sit bolt upright looking down or hunched over their kybds, and are used to not having a palm rest 'riser' they may not have the same issues I have.I REALLY wanted to love this keyboard, and purposely gave it more than a week of heavy use to get acclimated to it, but even chair height, back spring and 'attitude' adjustments haven't helped, and complex password and 'jumped out of page' editing errors continue, or maybe even got worse...and now I doubt I can return it, either...so may have to try making my own palm rest for it, or something....won't be able to afford another one for a while.Another minor gripe is about shipping: even with '1 in stock' and prime shipping, it took nearly a week to arrive, and then it was packed in a huge oversized box with just a bit of paper wadding at one end...but, it did arrive in ok shape even though the shipping box was bent up pretty good. (Too be fair, when it did ship, it went via fedex overnight, so kudos for that at least.)I'm a fan of logitech gear, so I'm pretty saddened by all this, and the fact that I have to continue my search for a 'better' keyboard still!",

          "Keys have a nice texture, lights glow brightly, feels very sturdy and well made.",
          "I am not a gamer. I wanted a good quality backlit keyboard with reasonably quiet mechanical switches and no need for software. I got what I was looking for in the G413 Silver, at a reasonable price.The KB remembers my brightness settings on startup, which is a big plus over my previous Logitech. It also has a smaller footprint and is much nicer to type on.Caveats:I did not need or want the USB pass through, but I don't have to use it.The one thing I would have liked is a numlock led, but it's a minor quibble.I'm considering buying another as a backup.",
          "My old keyboard died and I needed a new one ASAP. This one was on sale and didn't have too many clunky extra features a lot of other \"gaming\" mechanical keyboards have. From the unboxing, I already loved how minimalist the packaging was. Efficient. This keyboard has your standard layout: no crazy buttons all over the place, no weird sized shift keys or anything.It seems they went with a sleek design with the way the keys are raised on the metal plate on top. If any hair or dust falls in between the keys, instead of getting stuck in a \"pit\" in the keyboard, one can just brush it off easily, as the metal plate is flat. Keys themselves are responsive and much quieter than my previous keyboard that had brown mx switches. The red LED on the keys I'm actually not a fan of (too bright even on the lowest brightness), but I tend to have those off because they are distracting anyway. Edges of the keyboard are slim (1/4 inch from the nearest key to the edge on all sides). It's compact without being a \"compact\" keyboard just by utilizing space well. Look at the pictures and compare with other \"gaming\" mechanical keyboards.The USB cable is firmly attached and has a mesh protective wiring, so it would be pretty hard to unintentionally damage the cable. The double USB cable was a little confusing at first, but the second one is just a \"pass-through\" to the USB slot on the keyboard. Essentially, you don't have to reach behind your PC to plug in something with the second USB cable plugged in. Keyboard still works without using the second USB too if you have no slots left.Honestly, this has everything I want in a keyboard. I don't need any fancy bells or whistles (although this does have some if you want). I just wanted a mechanical keyboard with a standard keyboard layout that is sturdy. The efficient use of space on the keyboard makes me one happy camper. A lot of other mechanical keyboards are just way too big for a keyboard tray.I've been trying to find an excuse to buy a second one, just as a backup or a gift, or something. I LOVE this keyboard. Buy it.",
          ", which complements this board nicely.Mr. Logitech, sir, would you please stop obsessing with the gamers and make a backlit keyboard for us old farts...  (we have a lot more money then the gamers do)...Update:  the \"switching focus\" issue mentioned above is partially resolved by turning the keyboard backlight to its lowest level.  At this level, in normal room light, the key characters look kind of florescent, and in a darker room they glow just the way you would want for visibility...",
          "So I have only had this for an hour or so. I feel that I might type faster with this, however, there does seem to be some adjustment. the only real complaint that I have right now on it is the lighting is only red. but it matches my computer lighting so I am happy with that.I got this because my wife didn't like the sound of my old keyboard with Cherry Blue Switches, which were really loud, these are quiet, and feel really nice, with quick actuation points.UPDATE: So now I have had this for a little longer, I feel that I do type a little faster with this keyboard, however, I do not have the same satisfaction that I do with some of the other mechanical keyboards that I have. The minimal distance needed to actuate the keys is much smaller and that is noticeable and enjoyable especially when playing games.This Keyboard is very quiet and my wife loves that, the layout is very minimal for a full keyboard (with numpad), if you are looking for full RGB then you are out of luck, the only option is red, but it is still nice in my opinion.ALL In all I still feel like this is a 4 star keyboard, well built nice keys, great response, and some nice functionality, but a little lacking on the additional features such as dedicated macro keys and full color lighting, other than that an excellent keyboard.",
          "This keyboard receives a lot of negative reviews regarding the key type and robustness of said keys. First of all, if you're used to banging around on stock keyboards, the quality of of the G413 is a colossal improvement. It's got some serious heft and stays in place. The keys are very nice and responsive. Double-taps of keys to dash in game are now possible, since the activation throw of the keys is quite short. I do a lot of typing for work, and this keyboard is a dream for that purpose. All-in-all, if you're looking at this for an inexpensive entry-level mechanical keyboard coming from a stock keyboard, you will have a good time. Two thumbs up and four banana stickers.",
          "Out of the gate, I didn't like the uber-thick double cord. Like stupid Monster Cable back in the day: It's carrying the lowest bandwidth imaginable (an ethernet cable carries a million times more data in a thinner wire).  Cable is both thick and long, so a bad choice for anything where close neatness is a concern.But the worst, which I've now noticed others have also experienced, is the constant accidental pressing of the corner keys (like Control), because they are both tall and positioned right at the edge, with no bezel or palm rest. I have never mis-triggered the corner keys on any other keyboard in 40 years of writing code, but I do it ALL THE TIME on this keyboard. I will add a tall palmrest to solve this problem, but that (and the giant cable) have made this a very poor addition to my gaming laptop (which strives for clean/easy portability).",
          "I love it, but there are a few things,The USB pass-through requires a second cable, this is run with the main cable and is non-removable.  So if you use it you lose ANOTHER port on your computer, so not great for working from a laptop, you don't gain anything, you just have the option to plug it in in a different spot.  I can see the theoretical benefit but it doesn't help me.The keys feel good, I used to work in a high-end gaming store and it doesn't feel as nice as any of the Cherry MX equipped models we sold but for the price I am thrilled.The only/most annoying thing that actually cost a star is the metal chassis picks up a weird echo/reverberation from the spring and throws this tinny/cheap sound out after the key-press, It makes an otherwise great feeling keyboard sound cheap.  I do like the metal chassis, but clearly a foam gasket/bracing of some sort should have been installed on the bottom of the top plate, would have been an inexpensive solution that would make the keyboard probably 25-30% more quiet without impacting the key action.Lights can be turned off without software, I really see no reason to install the software unless you have the full logi ecosystem with programmable macros and RGB everything.",
          "I bought this for all-around use. It looks decent and has a much more premium feel than the usual keyboards I use.I haven't used it for any gaming yet, so I can't comment on it.The breathing backlight was super annoying. With it constant on, it isn't that much brighter than the regular reflective paint on unlit keyboards.I'm not sure on the exact thickness of this keyboard vs the K120 I was using, but I feel a wrist wrest is important if you'll be using this keyboard regularly.The keys are stiffer, so you might notice a little more fatigue if you're typing a significant amount with it.I've also noticed that I get way more password misses with this keyboard than any other keyboard I've ever had before. Normal typing accuracy seems fine, so I'm not sure why it's always the password fields where it seems to have issues.I do like the weight. It won't go slide around very easily while you're using it.It is missing the numlock light. I switch it on and off enough that I like having the light, rather than relying on the windows popup to tell me... Not really a fan of losing my right windows key either.  It's handy for locking the PC with Win+L. The left windows key work, but it's slightly more of a stretch.Logitech makes great devices. I love my G602 mouse, but I can't say this keyboard hits all the points I prefer.",
          "This item is being returned for one reason only: the switches.Pro tip: Test mechanical switches before you buy.This keyboard is an okay keyboard and for the price I'd be okay with it; however, the springs to the switches make a hollow noise to accompany your typing experience. The typing experience isn't all that much either. It feels like any old keyboard I've used, and I've been primarily using laptop keyboards -- so it doesn't feel like a step up. It's a very sad mechanical switch. Perhaps it needs to be \"broken in\", but I feel like that's some dream that'll never come true. It's brand new, it should be impressing and it isn't.Compared to the Razerblade Blackwidow Elite, this keyboard sucks. Try going to Target and see for yourself. I was not impressed with this, and I should've tested this out before buying. The Razerblade switches far outclass these switches. Typing on a Razerblade felt like my fingers were suddenly pleased with this unknown new experience --  they've been horribly repressed with laptop keyboards. Then going back to the Logitech just feels \"meh\".The keyboard itself checks a lot of boxes for me, including USB pass-through, there are not many keyboards with that. But it doesn't have full RGB, the cable management is not there (not many do), and the switches sound and feel cheap. The tactile feel doesn't even come through, like I said it feels normal to me.Bottom line: If you're able to swallow the cheap plainness that is this keyboard, you might as well get a non-mechanical keyboard. There's going to be a lot of keyboards for this price or cheaper. If you want a mechanical keyboard, go for something better like the Razerblade -- but try others out and see for yourself.",
          "To summarize:Pros:+Much quieter than a keyboard with MX Blues, but a feel that is equally unique and excellent, kind of like MX Browns.+Romer-G keys have a big stem that creates enough room for the lights in the keyboard to be there, so lighting is cleaner than an MX.+Cheaper than a good MX Brown kb with these same features (though that was probably just my luck)+Excellent packaging and build quality, zero flexCons:- Only one lighting colour, but you probably knew that already if you were buying this- You'll probably never touch it, but the top casing is really, really cold to the touch. Feels expensive, but usually just feels hella cold.- Tactile feedback is slightly higher up on the key (shorter actuation) and less obvious than an MX Brown, WAY less obvious than an MX Blue.First things first, this keyboard feels wonderful, though many people will dislike the lack of a loud, audible 'click.' Personally, that's the main reason I got this (roommate sleeps much more than me, but we both had MX Blues, the loudbois). Still makes a bit of noise, though, about as much as a membrane, more if you bottom out. Comes with a set of extra-gamery keycaps and a keycap puller to install them, if that's your thing. Personally, I would only do that if I replaced every key, and I like how these defualt keys look already. Another thing to note is that the keys are uniform, rather unlike most mech keyboards (you're probably used to having very tall function keys, and rather a rather short zxcv row.) These keyboard's keys, however, are all the exact same height, and slant slightly in the directions that create a slight curve like normal mech's do. As someone who grew up with simple chiclet keyboards, I type way faster on these than I do on 'normal' boards like a Blackwidow or a Das Keyboard.",
          "Unfortunately the only color that can be used is red, not my prefered but still a good keyboard, gonna give it to a friend when i get my G513 replacement.",
          "Working from home right now, and was using a Razer Black Widow Tournament Edition with their proprietary green switches (much like Cherry MX blues).My wife also works from home and we share an office, and the keyboard was just SOO loud. So I wanted something quieter and also easier to type due to some arthritis in my fingers.I like Logitech, and since I already have a Logitech mouse (G502) it made sense to look for unified software so I didn't have to have so many running at once. Not even counting the shenanigans of Razer's Synapse.So now on to the Logitech G413:Looks: The board has a solid, clean look. It doesn't have extra buttons, which I like (I have tried other keyboards with extra macro keys on the left of the keyboard, this caused some typing errors due to my muscle memory using the end keys to index. With extra G-keys, it caused a problem with this.) and overall the keyboard is very minimalistic. It comes only with red backlighting, which is fine since I have a red and black color scheme for my computer. The backlighting can be turned to various levels of brightness, or off. You can also make it do a breathing effect, which I never use. I leave it at the second to brightest setting, and static.Feel: The keyboard is very sturdy, with no deck flex. The keys themselves have no wobble, and have a matte finish. This takes a little big of getting used to, since the fingers don't necessarily slide from one to another as easily as shiny keys, but they do prevent a lot of grease build up. The height and adjustments put the keyboard at a great angle. The Romer-G keys are probably the main reason I chose this keyboard. A lot of people really seem to dislike them, mostly it seems because they don't work with customizable key caps and can't be replaced. This is a non-issue for me. I just wanted a keyboard to work and to leave as is. I like the keys and switch feel, even though some have compared them closer to rubber domes than to the Cherry MX Brown tactiles they're often claimed to be similar to. Overall, I like the switches and the keys.Features: This works with the Logitech Gaming Software or the the newer software; however, I like to use the older LGS software as its a lot more minimalistic. You have options to bind G keys to your F keys with the toggle on the keyboard, similar to layers on smaller keyboard layouts. I never use them, personally. But they are there if you want them to be.Overall: I like this keyboard a lot. It's much quieter than the Razer, and I think the construction is a bit better quality. It doesn't come with a wrist rest, which is a drawback. I did buy a Razer full-sized wrist rest to use with it, and it matches up quite well.I would definitely recommend this to a prospective keyboard buyer who just wants a basic mechanical keyboard that works, with little frill and quiet but confident typing ability.",

          "One of the most irritating features of peripherals these days is the need for additional drivers and software.  This keyboard simple does what you need of it without having to install additional software.  Yes, it's only one color, but you don't have to have some random program running at all times to make it do what it should do by default.",
          "Awesome Keyboard.  Great price.  It is very sturdy with its aircraft grade aluminum chassis.  I am very pleased with the Key switches, and the brightness of the back lighting.  Just plain white, which is what I wanted, and it isn't over powering.  If you aren't looking for a \"Fancy\" keyboard with a bunch of extra features and knobs, this would be my choice.  The brushed aluminum silver is a cool stand out from the rest of them!!!",
          "I originally bought one back in 2021, I was using it for gaming pc. The high sensitive compared to basic bare bones keyboards works wonders for my time. I now use it for job as a draftsman of which utilizing the macro input functions in conjunction with Logitech's software has helped to improve my productivity along with the mechanical clacking of the keyboard letting my coworkers know I am indeed working or at least doing something when we do not have anything to do. Down side is on the first keyboard the enter key does not function as well as it used to but that can be chalked up to the abuse I put it through though could argue the escape key should have been the one to fail first. I am not a fan of RGB lighting but the solid lighting of the G413 helps to see in the dark during late night computer operations as well as being able to adjust the brightness next to nothing. It is a relatively heavy keyboard being made of aluminum in combination with hardy rubber pads help provide a resistance to unnecessary movement when typing or actively drawing with CAD software when applicable. So in the end I got sick of using the cheap twenty dollar keyboard from the local dollar store and bit the bullet to buy another one of the G413s.",
          "This is a rugged and capable keyboard. I love it!",
          "I've been using this keyboard for a couple of months now and I'm quite satisfied with it. The red backlight is nicely visible in low light conditions without being hard on the eyes. The USB passthrough is also pretty handy, I use it for my mouse so I don't have my mouse cable all the way across my desk. Keys are nicely responsive and the tactile/sound feedback feel good. Nice and clacky without being distractingly loud. Not the greatest for actually typing since they keys require a bit of force compared to a membrane keyboard but I feel that the switches themselves will last at least as long, if not longer, than a membrane.My only real complaints are that it does sometimes get a bit warm on the bottom and if I'm playing games for a long time my WASD keys get a bit greasy from finger oils. Overall, though, I recommend it to anyone who needs a gaming keyboard and is on a budget.",
          "Little early 5 star review but I absolutely love this keyboard!Migrated from a ROCCAT ISKU keyboard and bought this because of the good reviews and because I missed the tactile feel of my old ABS M1 mechanical keyboard.  Reason I left the M1 in the first place is that the Black Alps switches were just too dang loud.  My wife would complain that she could hear me typing in the other room.  The Romer switches on the 413 are still decently loud but very tolerable. Personally, I like a loud switch but it can be intrusive to other people in the house.PROS:  Love the feel and sound of this keyboard.  Looks amazing!  The layout and minimal but very useful features are great.  Personally really like the gaming mode where it disables the WINDOWS key.  Price wasn't bad at $84 right here on Amazon.  Also made use of the optional keys for WASD gaming.CONS:  Haven't really found one yet.  You might need a wrist rest if you do a lot of typing.  Haven't needed one for gaming so thats not an issue for me.  One issue I had was the space bar had a sharp, snappy/clicky noise sometimes and I was on the edge of returning it..  But I removed the key and fiddled with it a bit and all is well.All in all I highly recommend this keyboard.  The price is a great point for what feels like a top quality mechanical keyboard with minimal features but ones you will actually use.  My ROCCAT keyboard had way to many keys that I never used and most just got in the way and were usually hit on accident.Thumbs up!",
          "Amazing starting keyboard or if your not looking to burn your wallet up. Feels great super sturdy. The plug in is annoying though. You have one wire with two connections. I believe one is for the keyboard and the other is if you use the port in the board for a mouse. Keycaps feels great. Switches are ehhh. I ended up building my own mech keyboard after being consumed by the thock I don't think I can go back to using this board. As said if your looking for a great beginning keyboard or something that is sturdy with quality feel the this will be beyond expectations",

My only complaint was that the keys wore a bit quickly, but THIS model is different than the BestBuy model it turns out, and the keys are coated with a higher quality finish.  It also came with a LOT of replacement keys.  I foolishly broke a key off of my old board when removing one for cleaning (my own fault) which was why I needed a replacement BUT this new keyboard came with a whole rack of replacement keys (which the one from BestBuy DID NOT) so now I have a whole keyboard and replacements in case I mess up and need replacement keys!  One of the best mechanical keyboards for the price.  Try it out at BestBuy.....but if you LIKE the feel, buy it here instead!",

          "A drop in eyesight left me unable to realistically see keyboard lettering in my favored lighting conditions of almost none. While this is not a problem if I am actively typing something or the monitor is glowing bright enough to illuminate the keys, a quick hunt for the couple letters/numbers I need while gaming or working resulted in a lot of backspace presses. This keyboard has near perfect lit letters with zero light bleed anywhere. It is incredibly easy to read and can be adjusted for multiple settings. Here I is where I found the perfect fit of finding the few keys needed without error and being able to ignore the lights entirely while not focusing on it.The key action is a bit weak. It doesn't feel bad to use but is not much better than a super cheap board. This doesn't really bother me but is worth a mention, and for the price I was hoping it would be a bit better. This thing is solidly built though, and with the perfect key lighting that fits my needs I don't think I will be looking for a new board for quite awhile.",
          "I bought this to game on my Xbox X. Unfortunately,  the Xbox only has 2 USB ports. I realize one of the ports is the pass-through but I need that too for a mouse. I cannot plug it directly because I use a 1tb drive to supplement my storage.My solution will have to be to get a hub and let that run the keyboard and mouse. I agree with a person in the Q&A who suggested Logitech was too cheap to have hubbed it internally...I would have gladly paid $10 more for a 1 cable solution.It's otherwise a beautiful keyboard,  and if I still had a computer set up, I would have fully enjoyed this. Mechanical is superior and this does not disappoint.",

For me it is comfortable and I've gotten used to the red backlight though I would have preferred white. I always put the feet/legs of a keyboard up for a little more angle and I was happy to see the feet were mounted sideways. Now I can move my keyboard forward a bit without having it collapse. It sounds minor, but for someone who slides their keyboard a lot it's major.It's a sturdy and heavy keyboard which keeps it very stable. I like it very much, and am considering getting one for each of my computers.",
          "I just want to start off by saying, this keyboard is excellent.  The build quality, look and feel of it is top notch - especially for the money.  Honestly unrivaled in that regard.  If you're looking for the highest quality mechanical keyboard for $50 and under, you're done searching.  I had originally purchased this for my parents, but after installing and using for a little bit while setting up their new machine, I went right back to Amazon and purchased my own.All that being said, my only complaint is that it doesn't have programmable G keys (macro).  But that's not a make or break for me as I usually use my machine for photoshop and office work.  Might not be the best for gaming though with this feature missing.",
          "so Q&A made me think these would be linear switches, which the box I just received late says otherwise.The quality feels really good so I'm only slightly disappointed, there's a slight metal spring echo sound while typing this review. It came with extra ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, q, w, e, r, a, s, d) keys with a different texture for gaming when you can't see the keyboard I guess. The keyboard feels much heavier than my last one since this one's metal, I'm guessing this is about 5 lbs?If you get this keyboard and experience the \"breathing\" effect where the lights turn on and off slowly then install the logitech gaming software (link found on the slip of paper that comes with the box) and turn off breathing from there and then disable the software from start up so it doesn't reset every time you turn on your pc",

I've briefly looking into key replacements and there doesn't seem to be a ton of options and cost nearly the same amount as just buying another whole keyboard.I have never had any issues with the usb passthrough or any of the mechanics. I've used it both connected to a docking station, usb hub (powered) and direct to a computer.  Very good keyboard other than the quality of paint.

Be extra careful removing the keys for cleaning as I broke off the left control key and that left it with an ugly look from then on. Lately it's been acting up double typing some letters and triple spaces, also not registering some letters as well, tried to clean it up but that didn't work so it's getting replaced. I got 4 years and honestly I could have cleaned it more often might still be working.",

I guess you really do get what you pay for.This is a $60 keyboard with $100 value at least when I bought it because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles but the build quality is great. I am not the biggest fan of the switches but they are still very nice and nothing like the $40 ones I had before.If you need a decent keyboard I would recommend this one, especially for gaming I was doing 40k dps in wow (2023) before this keyboard and I went to 55k just from changing keyboards.The keys are a lot softer and easier to hit than before. I have had brown switches before and this is a bit  like those but require a little more strength. Again the build quality of this board is awesome I know this is going to have lasting power.",

However, I do need to mention the \"0\" on the numkey was registering multiple times per stroke for which I got a replacement for under warranty. While there seems to be some luck involved in getting a keyboard that doesn't break based on the reviews, this keyboard is excellent for typing. I love the sound of Romer-G switches. I prefer the deeper sound of this keyboard compared to any clicky sounds of blue switches and slightly higher pitches of the red or brown cherry mx switches. I can type on this keyboard ALL day and I highly recommend it for office use.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I love love love this keyboard. I listened to the sounds this keyboard makes on youtube and it is so much better than any other keyboard to me. I used to have the Topre realforce which is a much much much more expensive keyboard but I didn't love they feel of typing on the real force too much. This is perfect. It has a nice dull sound compared to the other clickety clackety keyboards out there and I love how these feel. I didn't really want the flashy RGB keyboard and I thought this was a lot better looking than the standard mechanical keyboard that logitech has with the Romer-G switches. This is a nice in between keyboard that is perfect. I really like how the media keys can be used with the function button. The only drawback which is very minor on this keyboard is that it doesn't have a light indicator for the numlock. So basic and yet for some reason omitted. Not enough of a drawback for me to reduce a star though. I got this keyboard on sale for about $53 on Amazon.",

The only color it comes in is red, which is fine by me since that's what all my colors usually are. The overall feel and build is solid. It looks great, too.My only real gripe is that the keys take a fair bit of pressure to push, in comparison to my previous keyboard which had lighter keys. Sometimes it's a little difficult to press the left control key with my left pinkie, but it's not a huge problem.",

It also pairs well with the M720 \"Triathlon\" mouse and I use the USB passthrough for the mouse's Unity dongle. I have found that using the USB passthrough for the Unity dongle keeps everything super responsive which is critical for my work. It's as if the G413 keyboard and the M720 mouse were made for each other.There is something odd that I noticed: The exact same model keyboard that you can get from BestBuy has the white back-light. And the paint on the keys rubs off VERY easily and almost makes it unusable even for a touch typist. But the version you can get on Amazon with the red back-light doesn't rub off at all. I am guessing that the one at BestBuy is a cheap \"exclusive\" version and it uses a cheaper paint. Stay away from the white back-light version. Yeah, you might save a few dollars, but in the end you'll have to purchase the slightly more expensive red back-light version.",
          "I'm an old fart who just wanted a high quality backlit keyboard to make it easier to see what I'm doing when I type.  This is high quality indeed...  the keys are formed in a two part process...  the translucent part is formed with the character projecting up, then the black part is formed over the translucent part covering everything except the projecting character.  That's good; and far preferable to \"painting\" the black coating on.That said... I do wish the characters were larger since my old eyes have trouble switching focus from screen to keyboard.  But the backlit keyboards out there with larger characters also have the painted-on keys that wear through...  so I guess I can't buy what I really want...  ( suggestions? )I do love the style of this keyboard...  having \"unenclosed\" keys is the way to go...  all keyboards should be that way...It's a kind of \"clackity\"...  it sounds like the old IBM PC keyboards... the feel is great, but I could do without the noise...I highly recommend getting the 17\" Grifiti Fat Wrist Pad,\u00a0",
          "First purchased years ago and worked flawlessly then total failure 2 days after soaking it in coffee. ;>)Didn't even shop for something different just ordered another one and got different place for coffee.Excellent keyboard for general use!",
          "it's been over two years i think... i'm not sure. sometimes this unit has hiccups with my alienware r11 desktop tower and the keys will not respond when pressed. i then have to disconnect the usb cable from the port and reconnect and then it's fine. i think the issue stopped happening when i just moved the keyboard usb cable to a totally different usb port. there are several usb ports on the back panel of my desktop.",
          "Update - 1 year later:After a year of use most of the high use keycaps (w,a,s,d,c,shift,space) have worn off completely.  I have replaced some with the included keycaps, but some (space, c, shift) were not included. Replacement keycaps are ~$25 and aftermarket keycaps are hard to come by.  At this time I'd recommend buying a keyboard that uses a more standard switch and NOT the romer g.  I really like the feel of the romer switch but the horrible keycaps are a real bummer.Original Review:I bought this keyboard to replace my Techware Phantom 104.  I had used my techware for a couple years and after failed switches I started to have an issue with the \"W\" key failing after new switches were put in.  I had previously owned a Logitech keyboard that lasted me for almost 10 years. The Romer-G Tactile switches feel nice and are quieter than my Outemu Browns I had in my phantom. There is also less 'wobble' in the switch which gives them a sturdy feel. The backlight is bright on the highest setting (I have mine down a bit) and the keys are easy to read.First impressions on this are good and I'm hoping it has the longevity of prior products by Logitech.Recommended"

          "I originally bought this product after my old headphones which were by a different brand suddenly stopped working. My boyfriend recommended me to get these headphones and I was a bit nervous at first due to the cost as I\u2019ve never spent so much on headphones before. This was back in October of 2021 and with a whole year gone by of using these, I can say I\u2019m still extremely happy with them. I\u2019ve used these headphones a lot for gaming, video editing, and video calls for school, with my friends or boyfriend. The mic is honestly pretty good and is a good option if you can\u2019t afford a super nice microphone. These headphones are still very comfortable to wear one year later despite all the use/worn it\u2019s gone through. Battery life on these is pretty good and they don\u2019t take long to charge either which is fantastic.I highly recommend these, once again I\u2019ve been using them for a year and I\u2019m now in college still using them and They\u2019re fantastic.",
          "",
          "As the headline says, the headset is great. It's high quality, lightweight, sounds great, nice LEDs etc. The only con is the mic isn't THAT good.I switched from a old razer headset to this one because of mic issues, and while my mic quality isn't bad or annoying for my team-mates...it isn't crisp either. You might have to mess with the sound board/drivers etc which I have not done yet.Over all Im happy with it, and I think the mic will be better after i mess around with the settings. For $120, it's worth it.",
          "I've been gaming with these for about a week so far and absolutely love them. The ear cups are big enough so my entire ear can fit in and it doesn't pinch my earrings to my skin. The headband itself is adjustable and comfortable for long stints of gaming and the sounds is really good.",
          "sound & mic quality is leagues better than the razer kittys. cute colors, really bright & adjustable lights. even with the leds on, the battery lasts me for days. the removable mic is a nice touch. logitech software is 4/5 imo, but very usable.",
          "This is amazing comfortable, audio sounds amazing & I dont have to worry about nasty cords and breaking my headset anymore! You can walk pretty far with these & still be connected! Absolutely worth the money if you hate corded headphones like I do!",
          "So this is my first true set of gaming headphones. It can sound kind of funky until you adjust everything. But the sound is great once you do. They are really comfortable to wear as well. I wear glasses so that was a concern. But overall I love them!",
          "the audio is amazing i love this headset already \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
          "I have had corsair, hyper x , and turtle beach headsets and i always find myself liking the Logitech headsets. recently had the sound cloud hyper x and i hated them and bought these G733 and im in love with them. It even has a BLUE mic , and lots of tuning options too in GHub I have had the G933 wireless in the past and these are better than those in my opinion. Super Long range , battery life is crazy long on them and even longer if you turn your RGBs off. If you have liked Logitech headsets in the past you will for sure love these. Oh and they charge really really fast too. Highly recommend these G733 LIGHTSPEEDS",
          "Honestly solid headphones for gaming.  Love the sound quality tho can\u2019t comment on the mic because I barely use it.  Love the rgb cycles but unfortunately can\u2019t take advantage of customized because I play on console.  I have big hair and glasses and I have no issues with the headset but I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s been fitting a little loose\u2026so the head strap may be stretching out due to said big hair so be aware of that.  I don\u2019t believe this headset has noise cancellation cuz I can hear outside noise which isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me ( I have dogs so I can\u2019t be totally shut off from all noise for long periods of time).  All in all, love the headset\u2026one of the few in my favorite color.  Worth trying out.",

          "The G733 headset is great for gaming and Discord calls. It installed the necessary drivers flawlessly immediately upon inserting the USB dongle in my computer. The sound is crisp and the audio from calls is seamlessly integrated in with the gaming audio. It fits snugly and, even though there are only two suspension band adjustment settings, the smallest one works great (and I have a small head). I went to the Logitech website to get the download of their proprietary software and it provides a nice assortment of customizable options. The best part is that while gaming, I forget I'm even wearing a headset. I'd definitely order it again and am extremely happy with how well it works and without any complications.",
          "Son super comodos y el poder darle varios perfiles con la app de logitec hace mejor la experiencia de uso",
          "It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.Anyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.COMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.However, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.LOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.HEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.SOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.LIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.WIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.BATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.MIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.OVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.",

          "100% Recommend!!This headset does a great job at cancelling noise on its own. I wanted to test how good they worked, so I chewed kettle chips directly into the mic on the discord app (PC) with my friend and she did not hear a single crunch.Also, has the blue voice feature and you can change/tune your voice to make it more appealing (pitch).",
          "I bought these for my college-age son for Christmas, and he loves them. They were technically a gift from my parents, but he knew I researched and picked these out for him, and he specifically took me aside to thank me later that week. He so rarely asks for anything and he wasn\u2019t super specific about the type of gaming headphones he wanted, but I apparently hit the jackpot with these ones. I chose them because of the positive reviews, my longstanding good luck with Logitech products, and the white body with the cool LED lights that matched his Alien gaming laptop. Thanks for making me look like a Christmas genius/hero, Amazon and Logitech!!",
          "Been using these for a couple weeks now, the battery life is GREAT, they are very comfortable and have good sound quality.They work equally well for work conference calls, and gaming.",
          "The sound quality is simply phenomenal. The fact that Ghub allows you to customize and equalize everything about this headset is probably the best part. Aside from that the headset is insanely light for everything it can do. The build structure is great. It doesn't feel like it's weighing you down yet it doesn't feel flimsy and cheaply made either. As the title says this is the best headset I have had in 10 years. Probably going to buy a second set just to have as a backup for the future. Thank you logitech for making such a great headset!",
          "It takes a little getting used to for the sound and adjustments but otherwise it\u2019s pretty use and easy to fix in their settings but the one thing I have a problem is the mic. Whatever preset I use for the attached mic I end up sounding like a fishbowl. No easy way to say it. I\u2019ve watched YouTube videos on how to use the presets but nothing really pops up so I\u2019m the end I\u2019ve tried adjusting/editing the presets to my liking even making a new one for myself but it just doesn\u2019t work for me. My friends have said that they can understand me but I sound like I\u2019m in a microwave, fishbowl, muffled, etc. it wouldn\u2019t bother me that much if I wasn\u2019t that concerned if I was clipping my games and wanting to hear my audio quality. Other than that I think this is pretty good headset to use but I would suggest getting a separarte Mic to use for your gaming/streaming set up in my opinion. I did use a Corsair headset before this and the two were head to head for me; hard to pick which one was better but ultimately it came down to the mic quality. So I would most likely go back to my Corsair\u2026 if I didn\u2019t get the wires all messed up. (Hence why I bought this headset to try out) overall easy to use. Yada yada, don\u2019t let the mic hold you back from copping this headset",
          "Bought these to replace a set of Razor Krakens that died (very lightly used and literally just died one day) I was a bit concerned with some of the lower reviews I read, but I have found these to rival my 7.1 external speaker setup, so much so that I think I prefer the headset to the external speakers now.  The mic is crystal clear and the battery lasts forever! This was a very good buy!",
          "Hello! This may be an odd note but protect your hair! I have now had this headset over a year and I was wondering why I had so many broken strands of hair on the crown of my head (I game with my hair up). I NOW realize that it was this headset slowly chipping away. This whole time I thought I had stress breakage but as much as that may have also contributed, it was the strap of the headset, literally destroying it.If you really don't care about that, then this headset is fine. Also don't wear right after the shower because the moister ends up stretching out the band and it looks warped when it dries.If you are an intense sweater, not for you. All of that will absorb into the headphones and strap and start to smell, that's what ended up happening to my boyfriend so he had to get rid of it.I never used the mic so I cannot comment on that but I have friends that do and they sound \"normal\" on discord; It gets the job done. If you're looking to cancel out background noise its just best you get an application for it. If you have an NVidia graphics card you can use GeForce Experience, I love it.Sound quality and comfort are my favorite parts about this headset and is unfortunate that I will not be buying this again or I will end up having a mullet that I personally don't really desire lol.",
          "I <3 these headphones. They're very light and comfortable on my head, I can even wear my thick-stemmed glasses with them without discomfort!And it's just a little detail, but the volume control knob has excellent user feedback, physical bumps as you turn it so you know how far you've pushed it, and it displays the change on screen. All the buttons are hard to press accidentally, but not hard to activate if you want to. Good UX!",
          "For the price these are probably one of the most solid products I've ever purchased. I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \"stump\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.The sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house. They're a bit bulky, but I'm not putting them on for the sake of my image. The noise cancellation is meh to serviceable, I can still easily hear my dog barking out the front window downstairs when all the kids get out of school and are walking by to get home.The range is decent, I'd say it's about a 50 foot bubble from the transmitter. It goes through drywall decently enough, but not so easily through brick or concrete unless it's very thin. You won't be listening to Never Gonna Give You Up on your way to the mailbox, but a kitchen run is definitely still on the table.The software that comes with (Logitech G Hub) can be a little buggy, but your mileage may vary. My computer is an ancient relic from a bygone era, so if you're using hardware newer than 2015 you'll probably have a better time. It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.The sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.This gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \"fade in, fade out\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.All-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.",
          "Headset works really well, but the plugin is mainly good for pc and monitor, not laptop. The headset does not have Bluetooth, which is unfortunate but expected. Light syncing is really good with other Logitech products and customization is nice.",
          "Got them for my son and he loves them!",
          "I wanted something with a little range so I could putter about my home without the crackle and pop of a faltering signal. I've been burned before on a pair of Logitech G533's that absolutely would not hold a charge nor connect wirelessly, so figured I'd take a chance on a different model.I've not had them for long at all, in fact I've only had them for the one day, and will update my review if needed, but I immediately charged them and put them through a 10-hour run and so far I'm impressed. These were plug and play, worked and connected instantly, and I can listen to PC audio through these anywhere in my home. Granted it's a smaller place, so not much of an ask, but I'm just so glad I can listen to whatever or voice chat using the optional mic (though at my desk I use a Blue Yeti mic) while putting food together or slapping art materials together in another room.These look great with the white/aluminum corsair mechanical LED keyboard I recently acquired as well. Love that clean-and-colorful look! Will probably match all my peripherals to it whenever they need replacing.These are not strictly noise canceling but they actually do a good job of muffling the background noise anyway, which helps in concentrating on what I'm listening to. Not bad for something that doesn't clamp onto your skull with a vice grip! Pretty lightweight and comfortable so far, and the audio quality is pretty solid. Not astounding, but not poor by any means. Good for both voice chat and gaming, and not bad for music. For what its worth I'm probably not the best judge of that as I'm lacking a bit in sensitivity to lower tones/voices in one ear, so my hearing is always just a smidge off no matter what I listen through. Your mileage may vary.",
          "Got these for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he loves them!",
          "I took a gamble on this set due to a recommendation of the fellow operating the Amazon return station at my local Kohl's dept store.  I was returning another brand and he asked why 'cause he had heard they were very good.  I told him my problem (battery-life or lack there of).  He said he was a big Logitech fan and that I should look into the G733.  He used Logitech for his gaming which, in his words, would go on for far too long at a time.So got back home, looked these up and took a chance.  I am SO GLAD I did.  Comfort is great, even with glasses and wearing these 8-9hrs/day.  Sound quality is fabulous for me and the mic does a great job of capturing my voice naturally, i.e., no added tininess or bass.  But the battery-life.....oh the battery-life is amazing!After an all night charge, these can go 8-9hrs and still have 50-60% charge left.  I've actually gone without charging these for just over 17hrs and still have 30-40% charge. (I do turn them off when not using them).  If you need a headset for gaming, virtual training, virtual calling, etc.  I highly recommend these.  Well worth the price.",
          "Definitely the most comfortable headset I've had to date. I use it mostly for online gaming and everyone's voices are very clear and no one seems to have any trouble hearing me. The noise canceling is nothing special. The felt padding is comfy but can get kinda warm during long sessions.My only real complaint is you have to unplug USB transmitter from the computer to use other speakers. I wish just turning the headset off was enough.",
          "It has a decent battery life. However to extend it you're definitely going to want to turn off the LED display. must download the logitech app to control sound type acoustics and color pattern.good for women because theyre small. very light weight feel flimsy and cheap for the price. decent sound. not the best. gets the job done. They should be priced around 60$ imo. detachable mic",
          "These head phones feel good on your head and the sound quality is excellent!",
          "They feel super light on the head. Warm full sound. plug in and just works. no software needed.",
          "Love love love these headphones. They are light weight and easy to use tysm for the great Headphones",
          "Headphones sound great, but the mic is so bad I removed it and used another external mic. The LEDs on the sides are very bright and visible in your peripheral but you can turn them down",
          "Los auriculares son buenos, su rgb son excelentes, en personal siento el audio un poco bajo y el micr\u00f3fono no cancela mucho ruido, pero el micr\u00f3fono es excelente con su blue voice",
          "Light-weight, comfortable, sound quality, gorgeous, interchangeable head bands through other sellers, wireless, battery life, all fantastic. I listened to a recording of myself using the mic though and I sounded like I was calling in on a radio station, muffled, sounded awful. Expected a LOT better for the price and the brand.... :/Edit: after some research, I got a lot of improvement from the mic with the Ghub software so up from 3 to 4 stars. The mic quality could still use some improvement. I miss it when things just simply worked well lol",
          "Love these for gaming! Work great for the price. The battery doesn't last as long as the HyperX ones, but honestly, these are cuter, so I think they are worth it.",
          "\u00a0I use this headset regularly for telework and have had it for a few weeks now. Others say the mic sounds very very clear and crisp on their end and I\u2019ve had no issues with anyone on my end. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear and seems to blockout most ambient noise. It does come with a usb to plug in which is really nice and the buttons on the headset and volume dial are great. It has a soft band which holds to your head and is very comfy. I work a 10 hour shift with this thing and it\u2019s great.The only reason i gave 4 stars is because after about 15 minutes, if I don't get a call, it will shut itself off and I have had missed calls because of this. I constantly have to check to make sure the volume is up and that it is still on.But overall, great purchase",
          "I wish it wasn't so flimsy but it does a good job at being a gaming headset",
          "I bought this as a replacement for the Artemis G933 wireless. Nothing was too wrong with mine, I just felt like upgrading since it has been 3 or 4 years. If you're looking for a good mic with cheap as *%*( headphones, may as well grab this cause that's basically what you're getting.  (COMPARISON OF THE TWO AT THE BOTTOM)This produced seemed like it was going to be better after reading stuff, and a lot of the reviews that were negative didn't make too much sense to me in terms of how they worded things, so I thought i'd give it a shot anyways.- The bit about the light reflecting on glasses, is absolutely true however it's not that noticeable. If you leave it a solid cool color you really don't notice it, but honestly there's basically zero point in RGB on headsets except to drain your battery.- It does noise cancel pretty good, I think it isn't as good as the Artemis G933 but it does a decent job.- If you're looking for a headset meant for gaming and playing music or doing literally anything other than watching Live Streams, I'm not quite sure about this. The Mic Quality is great however I have the headset all the way up and in games I tend to have issues hearing friends (In particular Phasmophobia in game voice, I didn't have an issue with the old headset but with this one I have some difficulties hearing people)--------------------Feature wise, I really really prefer the Artemis G933.THE POWER BUTTON IS IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SPOT EVER. Every time I go to unplug the headset I hit the power button and it's so frustrating.- Instead of a mic you can push up and down, this one has a removable mic. I think this is a preference thing, but I just find it way more annoying because it tends to get in my vision so I just have to remove it whenever I'm not in a call with someone, and I always have to take my headset off to plug in it and it just really feels like an inconvenience.- When your Artemis G933 mic is muted, there's a red light on the mic - this one has no light on the mic. I think I much prefer the other as it's very obvious when you're muted, and on this one I forget...a lot. (I know the RGB flashes once when you mute it, but I only know that because of my glasses reflection, otherwise you're not going to know literally at all)- This headset may be lighter, but it actually feels like it's going to fall of your head at any moment. I have a pretty small head, and it really just isn't as adjustable as I'd enjoy it being. (You can adjust it a little but man it just makes me nervous)- On a positive note, I have WAY LESS problems with my ears sweating. It does occasionally push my glasses up against my ears and it hurts a little but I'd rather deal with that than ear sweating that occurs with Artemis if you use it for more than 1 hour. These ear pads are much more breathable.The only positive thing I guess I have to say is the mic is a little better, it handles me screaming when I'm playing games a bit more compared to my old one - however it does have issues picking me up when I'm mumbling or a little quiet (My old mic did not) I believe I need to mess with settings but quite frankly I'll have to look up a load of tutorials because it has a lot of features on this mic.In conclusion, your ears sweat less & the mic is better quality but the sound quality is just not up to par with Artemis and also the other small features the artemis has are better.However the Artemis has so many glitches & issues, this one hasn't had any just yet.Placement of the power button sucks, and I also don't like that when you turn up the sound slider it makes no noise it makes me think I've got sound turned off since the artemis had a noise.",
          "Pros: The range is nice, sound is fine, pretty comfortable, good battery life and charges fairly fast aswell, very light weight compared to others.Cons: Doesn't provide alot of noise canceling, this isn't really an issue for me since I don't like hearing myself muffled. the bottons and volume wheels are In pretty inconvenient spots. I find myself accidentally muting myself or messing with the volume whenever I got to adjust my headset.Worth the price. I don't use the mic as much so I don't feel comfortable enough to leave any opinions about the mic.",
          "\u00a0I got this to match the RGB of my other Logitech devices. The lighting is a cool feature, but I\u2019d say you should save a little money and get the G535 (you can\u2019t see it while it\u2019s on your head lol. I didn\u2019t think through that when I got it). It has all the things that are great about this one (headband, GHUB compatibility, comfortable earcups), but also has a flip up mic (so you can tell if you\u2019re muted or not). Still happy with it as a wireless headset from Logitech, but would probably recommend the G535 for the non-streamers.",
          "Long time Logitech user and avid gamer. I bought these to replace my old model Logitech wireless headphones. These are literally HALF the weight, and all of the performance. They fit on my head very comfortably, and don't pinch. The don't have the retractable mic boom like my old headset does, but It is at least removable (in case you want to use an exterior mic). I have found that mic booms that flip up, or retract in some way tend to break faster, than rigid ones. The sound is awesome, and the logitech software suite leads to some awesome customization options. The onboard LED lights are not intrusive, and are also customizable. 10/10 logitech for life!",
          "UPDATE 5/20/22: I still love this headset and the software updates that have been added since I got it. The newest features block out chewing noises, something I never knew could be so useful. I actually haven't noticed the volume wheel giving me any issues lately, which is nice, but I still haven't bothered with the rgb custom settings.I have found that sometimes the ear pads will move lower than my ears and sit really close to my cervical lymph nodes, which I'm only aware of because I got an infection and swelling in my throat on one side that nearly closed my airway before I was able to see a doctor and get it treated. Now I keep the sizing on a smaller setting so it won't sit low enough to put pressure on that area. I don't know for sure that's what caused the problem, but I'd rather not go through that again to find out.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There are so many big, bulky, black and red/gray/blue headsets out there, but not a lot that are feminine unless you want PINK. Which I don't. I was very excited to find this in white with a swappable fabric strap, though the purples and blues in the strap are pretty much exactly what I was looking for.First off, I have a very soft voice. Cheap headsets do a poor job of picking my voice out of background noise, and I end up being suppressed more than anything else. While gaming with friends, they have expressed concerns that I am being smothered with a pillow, have fallen out of my chair and my headset slid across the room, or that I am sleep-gaming. Right out of the box, this headset has put all their worries to rest. It transmits my voice at a volume that no longer requires them to turn their game volume nearly all the way down just to hear me. I installed the G Hub application, enabled the Blue VO!CE feature, and selected the \"High Voice - Soft\" profile after testing out a few others. Suddenly I could be heard as well as any one else in the chat, and I had to remember to keep my under-breath commentary to internal only.Those friends say the noise suppression is great on this headset too. I have a loud brother who, on a regular basis, walks around the house with his headset on, wailing his superiority for all the neighborhood to hear. With my previous headset, I could see my name light up in discord when he was talking in the next room over MORE than when I was talking (a testament to how quiet my voice is). With the G733, he can be screeching like a YouTube gamer right outside my room, and the noise suppression blocks him out. The thick cushion earpads do a pretty hefty job of blocking him out of my own cranial receptors, so we no longer have to pretend he is in the voice channel with us.The only down side I have found so far has to do with the volume control. Sometimes, the display pops up showing an incorrect 100% volume level, and turning the wheel seems to have no effect on the volume whatsoever. Other times it just decides to work. My 10 minutes of internet research found that this is a problem with most Logitech devices, so I'm not going to be mad about it.The LightSync feature allows you to change the colors that show on the LED strips, as well as the way they glow. It rarely seems to work when I try to pick just a couple of colors, and once I unplug the receiver and plug it back in, that setting is dumped, and the default rainbow rotation begins again. I have given up trying to personalize it. I don't have the patience to repeat myself over and over.All in all I am extremely happy with the abilities of this headset for the price I paid. It is super cute, makes my voice audible, blocks out my brother's raid commentary, and is actually surprisingly comfortable.",
          "I had been looking for a wireless headset and hadn't had much luck elsewhere. Because of my previous bad experiences, I was wary of this headset. I'm glad I went ahead and purchased them anyways. They're wonderful.Pros:-Super Easy plug in and use-Very customizable sound and mic quality through G-Hub App (15 minutes tinkering to your liking and you're good forever)-Solid construction and still comfy to wear-AMAZING Range (Literally I can walk away from my computer throughout my condo - to the kitchen, bedroom etc. and still hear at the same quality as well as chat with friends through vc)-Easy Mute Button on back of headset so you can mute if you forgot to when you were at your computer-Customizable lights at front (You can't see them while wearing, but it's a cute little extra detail)-Easy to charge USB-C cable-Great Battery Life (I charge every night to be safe, but I'll wear these all day with no signs of drop in quality)Cons:-They take up a USB slot on your computer-You need to have G-Hub running in the background of your computer for full effect (doesn't take much cpu from what I've seen and you can set to auto start in the background with your presets)Seriously, I was looking to get a wireless headset because I was sick and tired of wired headsets having their wires bend the wrong way and lose sound quality or have random other mic quality issues. I'm so impressed by the combination of hardware and software here. Every time I'm chatting with friends over discord and I walk to my kitchen to grab some water or a snack, I'm so happy I can stay in the conversation.tl;dr A solid wireless gaming headset with great range and lovely sound/mic quality (especially if you take the few minutes to download G-Hub and tweak things to your liking).UPDATE: 10/26/2020 - I've used these for a couple weeks now and wanted to update after reading some complaints from other reviewers.-I'm not anywhere near an audiophile, but I've been plenty happy with the sound coming through this headset. I played around a little bit in the software to get a preset sound I liked, and just stuck with that. It seems severe audiophiles are having issues with minor tweaks, so if you need a really specific sound these probably aren't for you.-I stream on twitch and my community commented my mic sounded a tad worse than my old wired headset. This made sense given it's not a wired connection, but I also went in to the Blue voice settings in the GHub software and asked a friend who is studying to be an audio engineer their opinion. They happily told me that a lot of the settings on their presets were excessive or just wrong and removing/adjusting those more severely created a much more solid sound overall (things like turning off the de-esser and removing the sound gate or compressor since they essentially did the same thing). That made the mic much better, but I still use my old wired one when streaming to be safe since I don't need the convenience of the wireless for that. I use these for everything other than streaming and the mic is still plenty great for chatting with friends over discord etc. Plus if I was concerned about having an amazing mic for streaming I would invest in an actual full desk microphone rather than just using my headset.-I want to re-iterate I have had absolutely no issues with the range. I live in a 900 sqft condo and literally will wear this everywhere while chatting with friends and have had no quality drop or anything. Any reviews that say they can't go to the other side of the room likely received a defective model and should request a refund.Knocking off a star for the amount of tweaking you need to do to really make the mic less bad (that's what the presets should have done, but my audio engineer friend is outraged at some of the choices made on that software  and how much the average viewer would need to tweak it). Overall, still happy with the headset. With how much stress trying to find a wireless headset that works well enough for me as an average gamer/streamer etc. has been, I'm happy this is a solution that does work.",
          "If there was an actual noise cancellation setting, this headset would be the ultimate pick-up",
          "***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!Initial Review:Ok, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...First thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!I previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:Pros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \"light-weight\" and unobtrusive.Cons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.I really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.As for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!",
          "I love that I can press the button to hear the battery level.I love that I can adjust the period of time before the headset automatically shuts off, to save battery.I love the comfort. I love the sleek design.The audio feels a little strange, I might have to mess with the settings a bit.But other than that, it's great. I can unplug the mic when I eat so I don't have to worry about accidentally dipping it in sauce or something.Only got a slight headache when wearing all day, but that's honestly my fault for not taking breaks. Plus I don't remember what I was listening to, or playing.",
          "Headphones sound wonderful, only a little bit of tweaking on the Logitech app's EQ and I had it to my liking. Only downside to the headset is the TERRIBLE noise isolation. for an over-ear, closed-back headset, the thin plastic makes it a terrible candidate for noisier environments. If you want a better noise isolating headset, go with the g933, best sounding headset and noise isolation from Logitech. all they need is a thicker plastic/foam on the inside of the cups and they will be GOLDEN.",
          "Grandson uses for gaming. States that the sound is great. Cancels out other noise around him so he is not distracted while playing games online.",
          "I bought this headset because I was ready to upgrade my work-from-home experience, and gaming seemed like it had enough parallels that it would work well in an office situation too. Unfortunately, it's not a great headset for that and I will be exchanging it for another model. I wanted something wireless so I'm not tethered to my desk, to reduce clutter on my limited desk space, something that would be comfortable enough to wear for hours on end (so no earbuds or on-ear headphones), and decent quality mic and audio so I sound clear for my coworkers and clients. I kept the star rating high because the headset met these needs which I assume are similar for gaming. However, it was missing a few key things for office use:- No easy way to tell if you're muted. In meetings, you need to be able to mute/unmute a moment's notice. This headset does have a mute button on the ear cup, but it's just a button; you can't feel it if has been pressed or not. The headset plays a tone and the RBG lights change color, but you might need to hit it once or twice to figure out if you are muted or not. I found myself taking off the headset and pressing mute to see what color the lights change and that is way too slow to chime in on a conversation. Something like a flip-to-mute mic or a switch you can feel would be much better for this. I will be upgrading to a headset with a red mute light on the mic so I can tell at a glance if I am muted.- Aesthetics are borderline unprofessional. This, of course, is totally subjective based on your workplace but I personally don't feel comfortable communicating with external clients while wearing a \"gamer\" headset. This logitech model is acceptable if you turn off the RGB lights (something I haven't done yet as I did not want to install more software) but just barely so. Additionally, I have a small head and these headphones look comically large. I've received comments in video calls when I have worn them. Honestly it's pretty funny and I don't mind with close coworkers, but it's not how I want to present myself to external clients. Again, this is very subjective and people with normal sized heads might not have this problem :)-They aren't very portable. The ear cups cannot rotate, so the headset is bulky and takes up a lot of space in your bag. Portability was not super high on my list of requirements, but if you want to bring a headset between home and office, this is not a very convenient model.I feel a bit silly judging a gaming headset based on how it functions in the office, especially since Logitech has an entire suite of products specifically for office use. However, there are a lot of great gaming peripherals and I know many coworkers have turned to them for a better work from home experience. For those of you looking for the ideal professional headset, keep looking; at $150, this in an expensive headset that doesn't quite fit the bill.",

          "I needed something wireless since my old wired headset was a favorite toy of my cats and I didn't want to overspend on a headset when my needs weren't intense, so I bought these since they were from Logitech LS and so affordable; I have a LS mouse so I thought that I would save a USB port by using these. That's not the case, Logitech hasn't yet made it so LS devices can all use one receiver, which is a real bummer.Between that and how flimsy they *seem* out of the box, I decided to return these initially. They are incredibly light in your hand if you are used to big bulky gaming headphones, and inside the ear cups the plastic of the speakers are just *there, exposed*. Seemed very cheap and trashy at first blush.I did decide to try them out though, and they are comfortable for long wear, the sound quality is pretty good for the price, the battery lasts a long time, the microphone is decent and I love that it doesn't \"stick out\" at all. All of that combined with the price I decided to not return them afterall; I've had them for a few weeks and been quite pleased with them all in all. They aren't anywhere near my Sennheisers, but of course not, these are 50 bucks. At 50 bucks I do feel they're a great deal.",
          "I'm really glad I caught this on a deal because I try not to spend too much money on work-related equipment. I work from home so these are FANTASTIC. Since it uses a USB dongle for connection, you don't have to worry about any work restrictions on your computer that might prevent Bluetooth connections. It's literally plug and play AND the battery lasts a full 8 hour shift. The mic quality if great(according to my coworkers) and the sound comes through fine, even when I walk to another room away from my computer. The range is good and the quality of the other product is worth it. It's worth it for work at home people looking to get rid of a wire holding you to your computer!",
          "...BUT there are some things you need to know. Things you will not find in the User Guide. So here goes:I purchased these wireless headphones specifically because I work from home and I was tired of being glued to my desk with corded headphones. Also, the thought of wearing corded headphones during a thunderstorm and lightning simply terrifies me. But I digress....First off, I must say that when the description says \"light-weight\" they are telling the bone-nose truth. In fact, I would even say that the box they came in was heavier. I actually thought the box was empty when I picked it up. These are the most comfortable I have ever owned. They are so light that I often times forget that I'm wearing them! And I absolutely  LOVE the over-ear design. For years I had always used on-ear headphones for work, and my ears would be hurting from the pressure at the end of a 10-hour workday. The ear cushions are very breathable because they are cloth, not the usual plastic/rubber like others. No more ear-sweat.Second, the sound quality is better than any wired headphones I have had. As part of my work, I take incoming phone calls, which are received thru my desktop computer, which is what I primarily bought these for in the first place. The call quality is as though these were wired--the caller can clearly hear me, and I can hear them. Crystal clear. So clear, that I forget that these are wireless, and that I can move around the room freely, or into another room, without having to take them off.This is true for both the Wireless Mode [dongle connected to desktop] AND the Bluetooth Mode [pairing with Smartphone, etc]. In case you are wondering, the \"dongle\" is that small USB-looking thingy shown in the main picture. Please don't laugh, but I did not know that these headphones have both options available as to how to use them. Yes, Wireless Mode and Bluetooth Mode are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS!! The User Guide does NOT talk about that, nor does it tell you how to toggle between the two options [Wireless vs. Bluetooth]. I discovered this purely by accident...you don't even wanna know how that happened...But anyway, now that I know these headphones offer both options for use, I give it an Extra Star!!HERE ARE A FEW VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO COMMIT TO MEMORY:[1] In order to switch from Wireless [for Desktop with the dongle piece] to Bluetooth [for pairing Smartphone] and vice versa, you must PRESS AND HOLD the Mute Button for at least 5 full seconds. You will hear a chime when it has switched over. This action is NOT described in the User Guide at all, so that is why I wrote it here.[2] As you are putting them on and taking them off, be mindful of where you put your fingers. You may touch one of the function buttons on the left earpiece by mistake.[3] Be aware that when you Power On, the microphone is not Muted! Make sure to Mute yourself, to avoid a \"hot-mic\" situation. To Mute yourself, simply Touch the Mute Button on the left earpiece. But, remember, do not Hold the Mute button for too long, or you will switch over to the other Mode by accident.[4] When talking on the phone using the microphone, speak in your normal voice, as though the person you're talking to is standing right in front of you. Resist the urge to raise your voice. Even though the microphone is built into the left earpiece and not sticking out in front of your face [another positive, by the way], your voice will be clearly heard.[5] Now. About the little light:--Blue Light, Rapid-Flashing=Bluetooth Mode,  searching for a Smart device to Pair with.--Green Light, Solid=Wireless Mode, synching with the Dongle. Also indicates the headphones are Fully-Charged AND Powered-On if plugged into the charger.--Green Light, Slow-Flashing=Charging--No Light=In-Use. Also indicated Fully-Charged and Powered-Off if plugged into the charger.I use these headphones all day. Everyday. Everywhere. At work. At the gym. On the train. On the beach. You get the idea. They have become a part of my head. In fact, the only place I DON'T use them is while driving or showering. It takes about 30-45 minutes to fully charge and lasts at least 16 hours of continuous use. A full charge may last longer; I've never had it low battery even after a full day of use.All of my other corded headphones and Bluetooth earbuds [which kept falling out of my ears anyways] have now been donated to the junk drawer, never to be seen or heard from again.I hope this helps. By the way: get the white ones, they're less expensive than the other colors for some reason.",
          "I got this headset due to it was on sale for 29.99 and I needed a pair that would pair with my phone and computer, both of the ones I had were starting to have battery issues.  When they came in I thought the box was empty they are so light.  The sound quality is amazing for the price, it paired to my phone super easy, with my computer was a little different having to switch from phone to pair it, but my husband understood it better than I did and it paired with out a problem for him.  Super light headset!! I cannot say this enough, when my husband was testing them on my computer to get them paired he was afraid he would break them due to their weight, but they seem very sturdy.  My one negative I have seen after having them a few weeks is what I noticed right away.  These are SMALL, I have a small head so it doesn't bother me, but definitely not for someone with a large head.  The  noise cancellation, it lessens sound but not as well as other headsets I have owned, due to that, and the size I did 4 stars.  Would love to do 4.5 because both of those are very small issues, and do not affect me muck if any.I have used these in a game and over discord as well as with my phone.  Everyone has commented that my voice is clear and they have no problems hearing me.  I have no problems hearing them or anything in the game.  I like that there is no microphone dongle in front of my face, it is all built into the headset, you can't see the microphone but it picks up your voice clearly.I think these would work well for a school aged child.  Light but sturdy, and would fit their head.",
          "These worked fantastic with the usb input , that is until I tried to test out connecting via Bluetooth to another device.Now my laptop is SAYING that the headset is connected through all the settings but I cannot hear a thing. MThe instructions are not helpful as all , as they only tell you how to remove the foam and warnings for safety. Nothing about how to USE the device.",
          "It is very convenient due to the multiple connections but the are not too comfortable (apart from being  very small).",
          "After a bad experience with another headset that was heavy enough at about 320g to give me neck pains, these were insanely comfortable. They\u2019re so light I barely feel like I\u2019m wearing anything. The earcups are on the smaller side, which suits me fine, and the headband fits securely without clamping too hard. And the blue/pink color is way more fun than the \u201cgamer\u201d color schemes of most headsets.While other headsets may have more impressive sound quality and more bells and whistles, the real standout feature of the G435 is comfort. It\u2019s still too rare to find gaming accessories designed for the comfort of people who aren\u2019t average sized men, so I count this as a fantastic find.",
          "The trick to getting this to work with a Switch is to update the headset's firmware.Go to Logitech's Support website. Download the firmware update tool (3.0.1.81 as of today).The update tool only works on a Windows PC and not Mac.Plug in the dongle (not the headset). Make sure the headset is on and connected to the dongle with \"lightspeed\" mode (a solid green light).Then you should be able to use the tool to install the firmware update.It takes about 10 minutes for the firmware to be updated.Then to pair with bluetooth, turn the device on until it is glowing light blue. Then press the mic button which should make it turn dark blue. Now it is in a pairing mode and you should be able to push the buttons on the Switch menu to make it pair.The page isn't lying when it says it works with Nintendo Switch, but what a pain!Edit: Nintendo Switch does not implement Bluetooth support for microphones for any headset. Since that's what I wanted this for and not just an audio headset I ended up returning this product.It's not Logitech's fault that Nintendo doesn't support Bluetooth mics...",
          "First off, Amazon sent the wrong color. Instead of the white/green, got the blue/pink. Sure, I could return easily, but the hassle of returning and waiting is just not worth it to me. I'm going to be wearing them and not looking at them, so whatever. The color is ugly as sin.For the rock bottom price I paid, $30, these are AMAZING. The headphones are surprisingly light. The ear cups are like really light foam and seem breathable. Very comfortable. I consider myself of the big head clan and these, extended all the way out, fit just right. The compression on my noggin is not much at all. The sound is really decent for this price. The bass isn't overwhelming, don't expect Beats, and the highs seem tempered and not shrill. The mids are slightly pushed down. I can crank these and don't feel the sound breaking apart. Sound separation is good too. It stays pretty punchy and tight.I would completely recommend these to anyone. The Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz work perfect. These could serve easily as a backup to a more expensive headset or as throwaways if you are rough on your gear. They're not compact and I wouldn't throw them in a bag. I could see these snapping or cracking. So be careful. But for the price, you could always buy another.UPDATE:I noticed that the headphones were disconnecting when using the 2.4ghz USB fob, which was plugged directly into the front of the computer. I disconnected it from that USB port and am using the one in the back of the monitor. After a three hour Crysis session, I've yet to disconnect. I don't know if it's because, the computer is sending out a signal that is interfering with the fob or if it's closer to the wireless router. Moving it behind the monitor seems to be working great.UPDATE (12/28):Just wanted to update this review. Still liking this headset. It's great. A couple of things I wanted to share. Switching back and forth between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth is a cinch, just hold the mute button. This is nice because I like to connect to my PC at 2.4GHz with the fob, but when I want to make a call, I just switch over to Bluetooth. I just made a quick call and it sounded very clear, and the person on the other end was able to hear me completely fine. Again, $30 for this headset? Killer deal. I just wish they made an all black one. The color is so Barbie. Ha!",
          "I got these on sale for $30 (An absolute steal!)Super lightweight and comfortable, a little on the small side. Love the dry-knit fabric around the ear cup. As far as the sound; the middles sound great and really pop. The highs on the other hand are a bit thin and get overpowered. The Bass is really warm and subtle if not a bit unclear at times, not bad or anything but if you like a clear and cutting, thumping bass this set doesn't deliver exactly that.Not a bad buy at all for the price.",
          "I was searching for an over-ear headset with the USB to Gaming PC as well as Bluetooth for my Android...believe me when I say that there are not many options from well known PC companies until you hit the $200 mark or so.I did some measurements (best i could) for anyone else concerned with the smaller size head factor, I'm 6 ft tall and skinny, so i expected it to be an issue.I wear these while wearing my baseball cap and still have a bit of wiggle room so its not half as bad as they make it out to be, the one downside to being designed for kids is even the black pair has the yellow springs that make them look that way a bit.I would say they strech downward between 7-8\" from the top band to the very end of the ear.I measured from my baseball cap top button to past my ear and got about the same, for anyone wondering how to measure something so odd.Measuring from ear to ear at that the 7\" length (wearing them) I had a 7\" width , which is perfectly comfortable on me. they can go wider but i can't speak on how tight they might get if they did.The ear piece (including outer foam) is about 4\", so if you measure from the top of your ear to the bottom and your around 3\" (give or take a little) you should be good on that end.As for quality:  They sound great on PC and my Android, I use an EQ on my PC for my speakers so its hard for me to tell if I'm getting the full surround or not since I'm used to it...but the options are definitely there and I don't feel like I'm missing sounds. At least not yet, they're fairly new to me.The Mic does not have the best noise cancellation considering its on ear, I can hear myself shuffle over my shoulder going to press the buttons and such if I'm recording...but its not overly bad either. I figure its no worse than using a Mic right in front of you or a webcam, except when your hitting the buttons (since they are right there)Switching modes can be a hassle if your wearing them, but if you do it while you holding them you can clearly see a color difference telling you which mode your in at the moment...I had a small issue getting the Mic to work on Bluetooth but once I forgot the device and reconnected it was gone.No issue on Windows 7 or 10, drivers installed automatically and everything worked as long as I wasn't in the wrong mode.I haven't had them long enough to comment on battery life but they did charge fast enough.All in all, if you can overlook the yellow springs, and they fit you comfortably...it the cheapest total package you'll find from most companies. If they added a detachable noise cancelling mic and lost the springs in exchange for a bigger sized fit, these would be top tier.For what they cost and what you get, definitely worth it. If they don't fit, you can always return them.",
          "I bought this so my 9 year old can use it with her Amazon kids tablet. It connects right away and has enough battery life for 5 days of her light use.She likes: the color, the lightweight feel, and being able to wander around while wearing them.I like: the price, the compatibility, and there is a feature to limit the highest volume, perfect for not ruining kids hearing.I don't like: the mic, it's not garbage, but it's not any better than what's included on a tablet or phone, and isn't directional. But my daughter doesn't use it other than for school from home day calls with classmates.",
          "Livianos, excelente para PS5, android, PC. No tienen nada de cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido, por el precio el audio es bueno. En general, se justifica por su precio.",
          "I totally love these headphones.I wear hearing aids and I often attend online seminars and training. I have used a wired headset for years, but it is heavy and bulky and, well, potty breaks were a hassle. Plus, I would often get feedback when I turned my head. I can't use earbuds when I wearing my hearing aids and they are hideously uncomfortable when I'm not. I have searched and searched for headphones that will fit comfortably for long periods of time and that I can use with my hearing aids. I saw an affiliate ad for these LG435s around Christmas and they are the best I've ever used. I'm thinking of buying another pair for sleep music. And did I mention that I totally love these headphones.",
          "The only issue I had was connecting to the computer and having to reconnect every time. Otherwise, very lightweight, and doesn\u2019t hurt head.",
          "UPDATE: 5 months in - it's still my go-to headphones inside my house. I still wear it every time, especially when gaming. The headset didn't get dirty (white & lavender one). The lightspeed performance is still amazing. A big downside is that it's not great when listening to music or watching movies outdoors. I'm planning to buy a separate nice noise-canceling headphone to use outdoors, and when watching movies inside.I bought the white+lavender one and for color it was very cute, I bought an Adidas Hoodie that matches perfectly with the color and it looks insanely well together.Here\u2019s my overall review:- Comfort : I have a small head, and being fairly young (early 20s), this headset was VERY light and felt almost no pressure on the head at all. My ears are fairly small too, so the cups fit in very nicely, although there was some nitpicking issue trying to adjust it perfectly at first try since the earcups had a bit different shape from my own. But still, it worked just fine after a bit of an adjustment. My ears felt no pressure against the sound board. I played games on PC for 5 hours, 3 days in using so far, overall very comfortable and the headband had no issues with me.- Connectivity : Lightspeed is amazing. No lags, no problem. I had to do laundry outside my room and still didn\u2019t had issues playing some nice music from my laptop inside. Bluetooth works just fine. It\u2019s easy to switch too, as you just need to press the mute button for a few seconds to switch between my mobile device and PC. One nitpicking issue was I did had some hassle connecting from my phone to my iPad at first time. I had to do \u201cenable Bluetooth connection\u201d mode to connect to iPad. Wish it would just pop up.- Sound Quality : Surprisingly good for $80. Comparing with my Sony QuietComfort headset, there\u2019s a lot of treble and high end which I think it\u2019s good for gaming, so you can hear more details. But the bass is still there, especially around 20-50Hz range, I could hear it for sure. I\u2019m not a HUGE audiophile, but coming from a music composer I think this is pretty decent quality for $80. It sounds in-between Sony QC and Sony MDR monitoring headset for me. Music experience was\u2026 Pretty good, but not all amazing. But surprising for the price for sure.- Microphone : It\u2019s not bad. Of course not an amazing quality, but considering where the microphone is placed and what\u2019s worth I personally it\u2019s ok. Someone who heard my mic on Discord says that it\u2019s similar to Apple EarPods microphone, except that it\u2019s stationary so you can\u2019t place the mic straight to your mouth. Overall people could hear me just fine while gaming, so that\u2019s good enough I guess. One issue is that microphone\u2019s noise cancelling doesn\u2019t seem to work well as I hoped. There\u2019s quite a lot of noise still.Overall I think it\u2019s totally worth for me, as I\u2019m a young student buying my very first gaming headset AND wireless headset. I\u2019m using it everywhere. At home, going to school, and everything. It\u2019s so convenient to have a wireless headset, and I think it\u2019s insanely light to carry and the design is great. Listening to music outside was fine, although it doesn\u2019t do a lot of noise cancelling, it was enough cover for me to switch between focus on the music and the environment. I would say this is just perfect and totally worth for students and young people like us getting into wireless gaming headsets.",
          "My fianc\u00e9 is a gamer and he said the sound quality when I used the Bluetooth feature and we were on the phone was pretty crappy but I think it sounded fine. I\u2019m just not a gamer, so I\u2019m not used to super high-quality headsets. It\u2019s a LITTLE echo-y but it didn\u2019t bother me at all. I plugged it into my computer and used it that way and the sound was much better. Music sounds great so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work for Teams meetings just fine. MAKE SURE YOU HOLD POWER BUTTON FOR AT LEAST 10 SECONDS WHEN YOU PLUG USB INTO YOUR COMPUTER. I thought it wasn\u2019t working and that it was broken but then I called customer service and she said even when you\u2019re not using the Bluetooth feature, when you plug the USB into the computer, you have to hold the power button for 10 seconds for it to recognize that it\u2019s plugged into the computer or something like that. And then it worked totally fine! It\u2019s cute and works so I\u2019m happy.UPDATE 1.18.23Do not buy this. This is the biggest piece of crap I\u2019ve ever owned lol. It just randomly disconnects and I HAVE IT PLUGGED IN VIA USB, not even using the Bluetooth. Randomly and several times a day the mic will stop working so I can hear my colleagues but they can\u2019t hear me. I\u2019m done, returning immediately.",
          "My son needed wireless headphones. I say that, because my wife had to pry a 3.5mm adapter out of an input hole on the front side of his PC, because he forgot he had headphones on and ripped the adapter sideways. So, he NEEDED wireless headphones. We fixed the other issue before ordering these, but they quickly became a priority.Now he is constantly wearing them and seems to love them. He can relax and kick back in his chair and play on his new HUGE curved screen.I really wish I had tech like this growing up, but then again these kids don't know how to operate anything now, so it has made me appreciate this tech more.Logitech is an outstanding brand. I always recommend them. My wife is a huge fan of everything Logitech at this point. I am too, but I also use other brands.",
          "I've used several bluetooth headsets before, and I think these are my new favorites. They're lightweight and charge quickly, and the connection is great - I can walk all over my house and still hear things. The microphone isn't great, but that's to be expected of a built-in microphone. They may not fit well on people who have a lot of hair or who have large heads; my head is small and they usually fit just right. Their light weight is one of my favorite features, as I really dislike headsets that are very large and awkward. This is my new favorite headset and I'd recommend it.",
          "I have been using it on the first day I received it for about 6-7 hours. I don't find any discomfort while wearing it. It's pretty light but might be too small for bigger heads. The mic is ok, I have been using it on discord and no one really complained about when we were gaming. The sound quality is good for my liking. Does it block out sound? I'd say it does a decent job because I can barely hear my turtle tank filter during gaming and watching YouTube videos (I put the volume around 60%). If I don't put anything on, I can hear sounds around me.The battery seems to last around 13-15 hours nonstop use on a single charge. I used it for 8-10 hours one day and then I used it again for 5 hours the next day.1/21 update:Sometimes it starts to get static and I sound like a robot on discord calls. I don't know if it's the dongle or discord itself, but if never happened to my other headsets. Will have to bump a star off. The audio is fine, might be a problem with the mic.",
          "They sound great, and they are pretty comfortable to wear, but not for long periods of time. A complaint is that you can barely adjust the height for it, but if you have a small head, for the price they are absolute amazing, but I recommend only buying this item when on sale, since I bought these for around 30 dollars. The noise cancellation is non-existent, meaning that it doesn't really work well, and they sound better then aripods which I spent around 150 dollars on. Overall good headphones for small heads, and buy them when on sale, it's a steal.",
          "First use. Just cracked these bad boys open today after losing my beloved second pair of Logitech H600s. Haven't really gamed on them yet, but I watched a show and that was okay. The noise cancelling wasn't that great, because it had trouble with voices. I got a lot of white noise garbage 'slurry' sounds when a lot of sounds overlap with dialogue.Then it's on to some music. For that, I of course listened to music I'm used to hearing (Earl Sweatshirt, the best rapper ever), so I know how it's *supposed* to sound (my other pair of headphones are flat/neutral studio monitors) These Logitechs exaggerate the bass, but it doesn't sound like it's \"struggling\" like a lot of cheaper headphones do. But a lot of the subtle nuance I expect is still there. The bass isn't muddy, either. It basically gives you the hint of what the studio probably sounded like, but without the intense resonance you'd get from a set of reference monitors that pick up everything.Keep in mind, as I have, that these are marketed towards gaming. Not music, or movies. I'm personally going to use them for work. This is the BEST headset I can find for the money. Old Logitech H600's now retail for $70 and they are NOT worth that. They are going on some sites for $100. The reasons I compare them to these is because they are the only BUDGET headset on the market that is WIFI (not bluetooth), have TWO earbuds and not just one like a telemarketer's headset, cover the entire ear (the H600's don't but that's kinda a bonus, since in an office setting you need to be able to hear your surroundings - Boss might be coming!), and have a MUTE button, which for me is vital since I'm NEVER at my desk.So many bad headsets out there without physical mute buttons and are bluetooth only and leave you beholden to whatever chip was soldered on your device's motherboard. Usually it will be a cheap, bottom-of-the-barrel chip that splits the audio so you can't even hear others talking while you are talking, so any noise that hits your mic will prevent you from hearing a conversation. It's really annoying.Dedicated USB is usually found only on high-end sets and will prevent this. When I go in to work, I will test how it works in a conference. It can't be worse than using a bluetooth set, even a \"high-end\" one. I will try these with bluetooth and the dongle and see how it holds up, then update this review.So far, this one is okay, but it does a little too much for my needs. I expect gaming to be good with them though, judging by the music tests so far.Edit:Editing this to add the things learned so far (~1 month in)I've used these daily for the past month or so and they are worth every bit. The old H600s were prefect, and these are near that, if a big more complicated.The Pros:I sleep with these things and so far they've held up remarkably.The bluetooth still sucks, but it's better than all other bluetooth headsets I've used, including $100+ units. These were half that much and sound way better than those other \"under water\" headsets. They are totally usable in a meeting. In fact, I forgot my USB dongle and had to use the bluetooth one day. It was fine. Other headsets were almost unusable.Gaming was great. Basically work like headphones, and the sounds are as good as any other headset if not better.The cons:It will shut off/disconnect after a certain period of inactivity. I have to check my connectivity periodically so I don't miss calls.There is an issue with them being too quiet, due to some \"feature\" that sets the sound output to 85%. I haven't quite explored this too much, but I think it is simple to \"fix,\" an annoyance at worst.Over-all I'm happy with my purchase. Not ideal, but then again, this market doesn't cater to people like me. Until something better comes along at this price point. I would recommend them for people who want to work, game and listen on one device and don't want to spend a bunch for features they don't need/want.",
          "My experience with this headset is only with BT as I bought it for that purpose only.So I bought this headset for gaming on Steam Deck using BT because I often play on Steam Deck with charger on and do not want to occupy the port. Also, I have a 9 months old who likes to pull and yank on cable.The sound is great. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not nitpicking the sound quality. My opinion on sound quality might not be a great reference. However, I like it. The noise cancelling is not that great, but it's fine for me as I don't want total noise cancelling. It's good that I can still hear if my wife calls me or baby is crying.The comfort isn't that great. The headset feels light but after a long session usage, you can feel the pressure of it especially if you wear glasses like I do (thick plastic frame).BT connection; it's pretty solid, I haven't really walk away from the Steam Deck and have the headset on but it doesn't drop connection while gaming until my old Skull Candy Indy wireless earbuds.Mic; unfortunately, this is hardware limitation on Steam Deck and BT codec. You won't be able to use microphone on the headset while connecting to Steam Deck via BT, but the Steam Deck internal mic will remain functional. Which is not a big deal for me, where I still can communicate on Discord.Overall; I'm happy with the headset and would recommend for a budget headset",
          "I have a smaller head and usual gaming headphones are always so big. These are perfect, bigger then kids one but smaller than traditional adult one. The sound is good and putting it on mute is simple. My only complaint is that you can't travel very far from the computer before losing signal.",
          "I liked these so much, I stole them from my son and bought the other two remaining colors. High quality and really inexpensive for what you get. The battery lasts forever. You don\u2019t have to charge it for days and days. The Bluetooth connection is excellent. The microphone is superior to an iPhone microphone and there\u2019s no silly boom. The speakers are superior to iPhone speakers. Excellent substitute for a hearing aid. I talk on the phone with these things, all the time. You can talk on them and keep your phone plugged in to the charger and walk fairly far away from your phone without losing your connection. I give it 15 stars out of 5 stars, why? Because I bought all three color variants they offer. If they had another color variant offering, I would have bought four and given this 20 stars.",
          "The head set is great!! The mic picks up EVERYTHING around you so I suggest turning down the mic level so whoever you're talking to doesn't hear everything around you.It's a little snug on the head but it's not a deal breaker.Friends say the sound is great and they sound great as well. Very satisfied with my purchase.It connected to my ps5 with no problem. Looks cute also \u2714\ufe0f",
          "First, these headphones are indeed for smaller heads. I have a larger head and these just barely fit me.The sound quality is fine. I'd guess that most people won't take issue. I'm a headphone guy and I think they sound just fine.The mic quality is also ok. They don't sound super-thin like with many other gaming headsets. They also do a decent job at not picking up too much ambient sound. You can find plenty of mic tests on YouTube. I didn't have time to record anything because I gave these away (cause they're too small for me).The build quality is fine but they feel really cheap in the hand. They don't feel like they're going to break or anything, but it's just plastic and cloth.My only real problem is that the mic would sometimes break up making my voice sound robotic at times. Switching to a different USB port helped but the problem persisted to some extent. Maybe there is another solution that I'm not aware of.All that said, $30 for a wireless gaming headset is a pretty good deal.",
          "Excellent for entry level gamers.I would say these are 5 star for kids that want to really game or just have fun as it has built in bluetooth!These definitely have their pros, they have Bluetooth settings so kids can use them on multiple platforms, as well as the dongle for console gaming and PC gaming They are comfortable, I tried them out and I wear glasses. I like them enough to use them on normal non-FPS games that require I -depth location awareness.A definite buy, especially as a backup pair.Looking at the higher model for my roommate, new to gaming so I know my roommate is not ready for $200-$400 headsets.",
          "I've been using these bad boys for a little over a year, only downside is now my friends make fun of me for never taking them off around the house and often joke about me taking them to the pisser while on call with them.They have a great range I can cross the whole house while they're connected to my PC! However, they only connect to PC via Bluetooth so a bit of a bummer.",
          "Firstly I'll start off with the reason I went for this headset.1. I needed a wireless headset. This is wireless in 2 different ways lol.2. I have grown sick of the \"pleather\" earcups on EVERY SINGLE HEADSET I buy falling apart within 6 months of buying the headset. This one has a mesh earcup so hopefully I wont have to deal with the bits of flaked off black pleather stuck to my ear every time I take the headset off. Not as good for sound quality in my opinion but its a trade that I'm willing to make.3. User replaceable battery. (2 previous headsets I owned were still perfectly good but the battery stopped holding charge around a year and a half in so that was a must have) PS This headset NEEDS a bigger battery.4. Very comfortable. Earcups are big and deep enough that nothing touches my ear which is AWESOME! Good job Logitech.Now for my gripes1. 18 hours of battery life is a joke in a world where my last headset costed 25 bucks and lasted 3 full days.2. Why in the world would you make a headset with no play/pause function?! I walk into the kitchen and a family member starts talking to me my only option is either to run back to the PC and pause it or take it off and miss whatever is happening. Logitech can I have a special firmware... Just for me... That replaces all the Sidetone on/off... sidetone vol up/down in exchange for double tap mute to play/pause? PLEASEEEEEE3. They have tried so hard to make this headset feel lightweight It makes it feel like a toy. Is the \"lightweightedness\" nice? Yeah. Does it feel as if its gonna break every time I stretch it over my fat head? YES!4. Why would you not put a mesh/foam/fabric to protect the driver/speaker? Within the 2 days I have been using it I have already had to \"tweeze\" 2 hairs out of the little holes to stop it from rattling. PS If these ever start rattling while playing music take a good look in the speaker holes... to see if any but of lint or hair made its way into one of them.5. Why is there no interaction with the ghub? Why Cant i sweak mic settings or... EQ settings... Or see an accurate battery percentage?",
          "LO BUENO :)Son muy livianos y c\u00f3modos.Los micr\u00f3fonos funcionan bien.La bater\u00eda dura bastante.La funci\u00f3n Bluetooth es buena.LO MALO :( Se ensucian f\u00e1cilmente en el color blanco.Los graves no son buenos.No cancelan tan bien el ruido exterior.",
          "First off, if you don't expect miracles from a $30 pair of headphones, then you'll probably be satisfied with these. I could only get 10 hours of playback so frequent charging will be in your future. The sound quality is decent, and rtings basically reports the same. Where corners were cut in dramatic fashion was in the build quality. If you picked these headphones up you'd guess they were $5, $10 at most. Everything from the plastic to the fabric to the buttons feel cheap like a disposable toy, as should be on a $30 pair of headphones. The ad says it's made for small heads; I have a fairly large head and it was quite a comfortable fit (probably due to the flimsiness of the strap, decreasing the overall pressure on my head). If this is your budget, then I'd say go for it. If you want something that will last longer, I'd look elsewhere. Audio is often an overlooked part of the overall gaming experience. If you're willing to spend on graphics or speed, you should consider spending on sound as well. Your time/enjoyment is worth money too.",
          "First things first: sound qualityTake Me by Will SparksGame Time by 3LAUm.A.A.d city by Kendrick LamarRapture (ASOT 1019) by Kryder and Natalie ShayDivino (ASOT 1013) by Armin van Buuren and Maor LeviUsually, when testing a new set of headphones/ earphones, these five songs get played immediately after connection to my PC or phone. I do this because there is a massive Hz range among them, highs, mids, lows, treble, bass, etc. So far, there are no distortion, clipping, or stutters with the G435s, which other headsets I've had do out of the box.The sound quality is AMAZING. Each tiny little sound is accentuated with this headset. After playing some games, I noticed that I am hearing sounds that I otherwise wouldn't be hearing with my now broken Steel Series Arctis 7 Pro, which can be nearly double the price of the G435. According to my research, the older versions of the Steel Series Arctis 7 Pro had a design flaw; the power button is connected to a tiny lever that snapped on my pair, rendering it completely useless, which could happen to anyone who has had the older version. Don't get me wrong, the SS Arctis 7 Pro is also an AMAZING headset that does everything well, just like the G435. Still, I don't have money to buy another Steel Series, so I opted for the G435s (buy a steel series if you have money to blow). I am staggered with how well the G435s perform according to my needs. Either the Arctis 7 Pro or the G435 are fantastic choices depending on the price range you have; you can't go wrong with either, but keep in mind more expensive doesn't always mean better.Second: Construction and ConnectivitySeem sturdy out of the box, but only time will tell if the buttons do/ don't stick, the headband sags, ear cups flatten, etc. Given the construction out of the box, I am hopeful the G435s will last me for potentially years to come. The buttons are snappy, which I really like; there is positive textile feedback with every button. When I press any button, I know that the G435s will react accordingly. The headband and earcups are incredibly comfortable, I have a pretty large head, and my ears are larger than average. I notice the headband isn't too tight or loose, most importantly comfortable. The ear cups have significant space for my big-a** ears which the SS Arctis 7 Pro couldn't provide (my right ear actually chaffed and bled into the cup fabric, then scarred over almost like cauliflower ear). Each cup on the G435s is clearly marked with a bright R and L on the inside of the band and braille on the outside. The braille is fantastic because I know some braille and don't need to even look at the R or L to tell if they're on correctly. Another massive feature of the G435s is that the earcups (like most headsets) are replaceable. If they flatten, I can just buy another set and replace them. My PC doesn't have Bluetooth, so the USB dongle is handy. The connection with the port is nearly instant, and the range is fantastic too; it isn't far enough for me, but realistically, when I'm playing games, I'm at my desk next to the dongle, not down the street playing basketball.I WILL UPDATE WHEN AND IF PROBLEMS ARISEFor now, if you need a well-built, good-sounding, comfortable headset... get these.",
          "The G435 is not the best headphones, but it's pretty darn good for its price, especially with the sale ($30 at the time I bought them). Sound quality is the most neutral and clear I've heard. The only downside is that the materials are cheap and thus won't block any noise. If it had noise cancelling, I wouldn't mind paying extra 30 bucks to get it. It would still be the best $60 headphones out thereI can't believe most people complain about the sound quality of these headphones. Most 'popular' headphones out nowadays have artificially over-exaggerated bass tones without the actual hardware to support it. Prior to getting these, I ordered the Soundcore Q30 but returned it immediately after trying it out for 30 seconds. The sound quality on those are terrible with non-existent mid range and awfully loud bass that overwhelms the treble.Usability wise, I barely fit into these but I have a big head for a 5'9 male. Only complain is that I'm using an older Macbook (2015) and when using the lightspeed connection, changing the system volume won't actually change the volume of the headphones. Logitech doesn't seem to have an answer for this and keeps telling me to contact Apple. (SMH). It's fine because I use the bluetooth connection anyway",
          "At $30, there is simply nothing else like this. It's a wireless headset for under $50. I was not expecting much out of these, but the sound surprised me. It's surprisingly full and bassier than I expected. You will have no trouble picking out sounds in game. The noise isolation is mediocre since it's all passive. The build quality is okay. They are light and feel kinda cheap, but the all plastic construction is actually sturdier than initially suspected. I toss them around quite a bit and they shot no signs of distress after a couple months.Overall, highly recommend them under $50. For $30, I might even grab a spare while I still can.",
          "I purchased a Stram Deck back in November 2022 (great gaming PC and it's mobile) and visited my parents for a few weeks around Thanksgiving.  While there my headset broke and was shopping for a new headset.  I wanted one that supported Bluetooth and was browsing here on Amazon and discovered this headset from Logitech for less than $50.  The headset is mostly made out of plastic and I was apprehensive about buying it.  If I remember correctly Amazon offered next day delivery so I purchased it.  I have been surprised with the sound quality as well as the durability of this headset.  It is also very light and comfortable to use for extended gaming sessions that the great battery life enables.  Would I buy this again?  Yes I already have, I bought another one in January as a birthday gift for my son.",
          "Things I like:1. they are $30 on sale2. they have both lightspeed USB and bluetooth capabilities3. USB C charging4. the wireless range  (specifically using bluetooth) is really good, like much better than most other bluetooth headphones I've tried5. they are fairly comfortable due to their light weight and large earpadsThings I don't like:1. they feel really cheap, there isn't an ounce of metal anywhere in the build and they just feel like they would snap if you dropped them2. even though they are fairly comfortable overall the headband doesn't have any padding so they can start to hurt after a while3. There is a very faint buzzing in the left earcup during some frequencies (both with bluetooth and USB wireless mode). Some songs sound bad because of it. I could probably get it RMA'd for this but it's not too big of a deal for $304. Even if you ignore the buzzing sound the headphones don't sound great, and this is coming from someone who does not have super high standards when it comes to audio. For comparison, these sound slightly worse than the wired apple earbuds you get with your phone.",
          "I've been using a cheaper Logitech set of headphones since the fall of 2018.  I began online teaching in the early morning hours and weekends.  The set I got worked pretty well, I bought a second set.  But then I thought getting a colored set, more expensive, with a few bells and whistles would be great.So I wanted to upgrade and purchased two of the more expensive Logitech headsets .. that cover your entire ear.So, I'm nearly blind and rely on my sense of sound to compensate for what I cannot see.  I was unprepared for the sense of unbalance with the full ear cover set.  And I could not hear myself.  And I had to keep reaching up to pull them away from my ears to let the air pressure equalize.I have one bright child, Anna, who only lasted 15 minutes with the new set before begging me to put on the old ones.  (I can't hear you with that one .. it just sounds so different.)  We also tried the bluetooth set, and said the same thing.  I began asking my other students ... every one of them wanted me to use my old headphones.  Although one said the bright color was \"disturbing\" after seeing the black ones for 3  years.So, I'm going to return these.They set up fast to my computer and the bluetooth connection was fantastic.  It was freeing to not worry about a cord.I kept hitting the  buttons on the back of the ear when I would adjust them or let my ears breathe.  I could never find the ones that I wantedI kept hearing myself yelling because I could not hear myself ... this made it hard to think.In the end, nice as they are ... they are not for me.  Very sad.",
          "Muy c\u00f3modos, ligeros y est\u00e9ticamente bonitos. Sonido bueno y aceptable, lo \u00fanico que siento que el m\u00e1ximo volumen de estos aud\u00edfonos no es lo suficientemente alto.",
          "Its a solid head set for the money. Sound could be better but cant be mad at it because of the price",
          "I got these for $35 on sale, for that price they are actually decent, if I paid 80 for them I'd be completely absolutely pissed and fuming, I mainly got them because their very, very lightweight and Bluetooth for my steam deck, they are also a bit flimsy, they feel like they'd last a while but don't abuse them, they don't sound good, but they do sound $35 good, their typical gaming headphones, muddy and muffled compared to anything nice, again though, decent for what they are for the price I paid, the mic, probably one of the legitimate best headset mics I've ever used, and I've had a lot of headsets, its clear and doesn't sound that bad, a little eq and noise reduction and it would sound honestly okay, the mic is actually higher quality than the speakers inside it, all in all, it's a cheap Bluetooth headset with the option for USB low latency, it works best as a travelling pair for my steam deck though as it's very lightweight, I would not get these as a main pair though, you can get so much better wired headphones for either price point",
          "So I have a set of G533 wireless headphones that I have had for over 3 years. Pretty happy with them...can't find the dongle...FML. Bought these for $29. I liked that they were both RF AND Bluetooth capable. I have some earbuds, but have had some serious Bluetooth lag issues with my laptop when using earbuds. The G435's do not appear to have this issue or if they do it is barely noticeable. +1 for the G435! Downside: Sound is not all that great. Bass is pretty poor. Is good for comms when gaming, and I actually do like the mics being part of the headphone instead of having a mic boom like on the G533, which I was always worried about breaking. People I have been talking to on TS and Discord say I am coming in 5x5. Another review I read said these headphones were small. I have a big ole noggin and they DO fit my head, though not by much. They are very lightweight and comfortable to wear. For $30 I would say these are good, not great. For the regular price of $80, no way I would spend that much money on them.",
          "They are amazing headphones, but I am stressing, because they don't fit my regular size ears. These are not for average to large ears. I am going to have to return them, because they only fit small ears.",
          "Tardo mas de lo esperado por que se habia perdido en el camino, por suerte amazon me rembolso el dinero y lo compre de nuevo y esta vez me llegaron y bastante r\u00e1pido, los audifos son bastantes c\u00f3modos y ligeros y su bater\u00eda dura bastante.",
          "I bought these for my nephew and they work well with PlayStation 4. I didn't realize they were white/lilac though. But he still likes them. And they are a good value for the price. I have the G432's (not wireless) and the G435's are much better and more comfortable (being wireless is a definite plus in my book). The sound quality could be a bit better, but they are good for a $30 gaming headset.I might get the black/yellow G435's for myself. However, I will stick with the G535's for now.",
          "I bought these just for my ps5. When I went to 'bluetooth' on my ps5, It shows up (when I try to pair them) but I can't register them? Does that mean they didn't work, no. I then went to 'Sound' and they show up as a device to use as an output so I select them as an output (and then was able to test the mic) and they work fine. The sound is good (I had to crank the volume up on my headphones) and the mic is very good (only go half way up on the mic volume from the ps5). Going back to the 'bluetooth registering' part, I don't know if that message appears for any kind of headset you try to register? I guess it's a question for the ps5 people but at the end of the day I can toggle between this and the tv as an output device.",
          "I bought these for my daughter as many other less expensive models have failed. Luckily I was able to catch these on a pretty good sale. Very colorful, connected easily, a good value.",
          "At the time of this writing (14.1.2023) this headset, at least the Blue/Pink color swatch (which is awesome; haters gonna hate) was on sale for $30.One Sentence Review: For $30, you will never get anything better. Buy it. At full MSRP, I would suggest waiting. Do not pay more than $50 (read full review below for reasoning).Longer Review:The Logitech G435 is a no frills, entry level \"gaming\" headset. Usually anything specifically targeted for gaming is sub-par, but Logitech has been fiarly consistent in high quality accessories. The G435 continues this trend.For the sale price $30, you will quite literally never get a better sounding pair of headphones. Is the sound quality audiophile quality and going to blow you away? Of course not, but that's not the aim of these kind of headsets/headphones.For what they are, they sound phenomenal. They don't have an EQ (and I'm unsure if Logitech's propitery software, G-Hub, supports EQ and onboard memory writing) on board, but plugged into my PS5 there is a solid low end of bass, and mids and treble are well balanced. There's no over-washed mid tones causing hiss.The PS5's 3D audio engine (its really just a spatial audio trick, but it works wonderfully) sounds crisp and full. I would assume that any spatial audio software (i.e.: Dolby Access) on Windows will work equally well.On sale, these are a no-brainer to buy. The suggested MSRP for this ($79.99) is too much of an ask. As good as these are, I would not pay more than $50. This is in no way to suggest these sucks, it's just the limits of audio quality/price value diminish rapidly after that point.",
          "Date of Purchase: 08/05/22Purchase Total: $60.05Primary Use: Work | Zoom, WebX, Teams, Discord | Music | Apple Music, YouTube, SpotifyPrimary OS: MacOSTested on: Mac Mini, Macbook Pro (2019 ish model), iPhone 13, Windows 11, Windows 10, *UbuntuNot tested on: Android, or any other flavor of linux besides Ubuntu*only tested with BluetoothOverall Score: 5.58 / 7(Scoring Scale used below is based on a 1/10 model)Summary: This headset is my favorite wireless headset to date. If you're looking for a lightweight comfortable headset that has above average / relatively good sound quality with excellent noise cancellation and suppression: this one's for you.TLDR;PROS:1. Comfortable and lightweight 9.5: Above and beyond comfort and feather-light design2. Affordable 10/10 (discount price due to sale at time of purchase, see above)3. Battery life 8.67: amazing battery life, all day lifespan (8+hr daily usage)4. Mic Quality 4.0CONS:1. Audio Quality 3.9: absent or low-quality base/lows | See below for more details (don't buy these if you're an audiophile looking for some lightweight on-the-go headphones/headset or if you're expecting to hear every tone of an explosion gaming.2. Controls and Interface 2.5: mute and current status of mute or mode is needing work. You cannot tell when muted easily.3. Size 3.0: If you have a large head, do not buy this headset.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight 9.5I use this headset primarily for work and subsequently wear it for about 8-10 hours a day. With other headsets, after a few hours there is some fatigue on my ears, and head. If you use a headset regularly you know what I mean. There is absolutely no fatigue that I've experienced in the ~month that I've had the headset. I don't have a scale to weigh this accurately, the reported weight by amazon is 165 g. It is not necessarily the _actual_ weight that defines the way this headset's weight is perceived on your head.  Let me explain:Logitech has brilliantly designed the load-distribution on this headset. It seems to utilize the natural shape of your face/head and uses them in a way that feels like nothing is on at all, without sacrificing audio quality. You know it's there, but, it's almost a part of you that you grow accustom to faster than you would expect;  It's quite comfortable - the ear cuff material is a soft/smooth polyester that is similar to a Steel Series headset, but with a slightly more smooth/sheen texture. It is a unique material and feels high quality and durable. It has a hex pattern stitched within the same which should additionally increase the lifespan of this cuff. The padding is not very firm, nor thick. This usually causes a little bit of audio seal loss and sometimes audio quality. Logitech has achieved a Goldie-locks situation here and my figurative and literal hat is off to them.The lessened pressure towards your face has enabled me to use this headset for extended periods of time: I wear glasses and most headsets will apply pressure to the top of my ear, or just above the ear, which after time will become very uncomfortable as the plastic or metal is driven to your skull. This is not an issue with this headset. You are provided a full day's worth of gaming, or in my case, meetings - without much discomfort if any at all. Additionally, I am obsessed with hats and wear one even indoors every day. If you are like me and enjoy a cold-ass work environment, you may also enjoy wearing a beanie. Regardless, if you like to wear hats and over the hear or on the ear headsets usually cause added discomfort when wearing a hat; fear no such thing on this headset. Again i wear this for at least 8 hours a day, if not more and have experienced no discomfort or fatigue.* Affordable 10: I am fairly certain it was on sale at time of purchase. I would wait for a sale as the headset is, in my opinion, worth almost exactly what I paid, $55-65. If it is currently listed for more money at the time you are reading this, I would suggest waiting or using a discount extension like honey. This headset is not worth more than $65.* Battery life 8.67: So far this has worked as advertised, I get about 16 - 19 hours of use, depending on the mode. Bluetooth will consume more battery life than the wireless so keep this in mind when taking the battery life into consideration. Additionally, this is at the time of writing. Batteries will naturally deteriorate over-time. More on this topic at a later date. Time of writing: 08/27/22.Mic Quality 4.0 : I have had no complaints from colleagues or clients - and have had an opportunity to listen to myself via Zoom recording. It is nothing super special to write about, but it equally well above average. It is especially impressive given there is no mic arm, the noise suppression is achieved flawlessly and you cannot hear my fan, mouse/keyboard, nor any other background noise. I have been unable to thoroughly test this with varying levels of Decibels, however, it is very impressive nonetheless. There are two microphones on this headset to help achieve both the noise cancellation and the noise suppression. If you didn't already know, both of these methodologies (in simple terms) use a microphone and some fancy alg to produce an equal but opposite sound wave to cancel the other. The secondary microphone is placed just above the primary  and is a vertically oriented, relative to the upright position of the headset, and of linear design. This produces high quality noise cancel/supp.Let's talk Cons:*Audio Quality 3.9The audio quality on calls, meetings, voice-chat is flawless. This headset produces fairly accurate Highs and mids - you will not be disappointed with these EQs, however, the base and lows are either weak, or missing entirely. This headset was designed with comfort and weight in mind, naturally, the drivers take a hit here. You will not hear any thumping bases, or sometimes, not even any lows. If you are an audiophile and looking for some music headphones, these are NOT for you. If you are a gamer, or looking for a zoom/webx/insert-your-meeting-software-here headset, then you're in the right place.* Controls and Interface 2.5 : My least favorite part of this headset, has to be the controls. The Bluetooth to wireless mode switch is on the bottom of the headset. It will play different tones based on what mode you change it to, and the light will be either blue for Bluetooth or teal for wireless. This is handy, but you can't see this at all, nor can you tell if it is in pairing mode, without taking it off and checking. The pairing mode does not tell you audibly if it is in pairing or not. which is frustrating and confusing. The power button will not directly turn your headset back on, immediately after you power it off. i.e if you're having some issue and you want to power-cycle the device, tapping power right after it goes off will not power it on. You must power it off, wait.... then press & hold the button. I don't think it's a HUGE deal, but it is annoying.The mute button plays an easy to understand tone in your ear, an enable tone, and a disable. This is great, however, this tone will duck the rest of your sound, which can lead to miscommunication on a call. I've had to mute for random coughs, or maybe my dog is doing something, etc. Everyone needs to mute on the fly - however - i do not appreciate that during such, you cannot hear what someone may have said.Lastly, other than the tone of the headset when it's muted, there is no visual or easy way to determine if it is muted unless you take it off. This headset does not interface with Logitech's G-hub and so if you're hoping to have additional controls over the headset, such as EQ or the like, there will be no such success. The hub will literally say \"no need for this\" and that will be the end. @Logitech - a suggestion I might have would be either an OSD of a simple mute/off-mute graphic, or a phone/watch app of the same. There are also APIs that could be taken advantage of that would sync with zoom or other meeting room software - I don't see how this couldn't be easily accomplished via software/firmware update. It is frustrating to have to un-mute then re-mute just to verify you're muted (without taking the headset off, subsequently missing more information). This causes triple (or more) the audio ducks aforementioned which is how you end up missing chunks of info. I feel that this needs to be customizable in software so that I can reduce the attenuation that is performed.Size 3.0: If you have a large head, do not buy this headset. I was surprised with how small this headset is and how little you can adjust the sliding cuffs. I have an small to average size head, for reference I wear the small/med size of the \"one size fits all\" hats and they fit perfectly. I don't know what size it actually is and don't plan to measure nor provide that information online :) however - I can say with certainty - if you have a large head or face, these may not even make it to your ears and/or will not be comfortable. This is a non-issue for me and as such I love this headset, but would not recommend it to those who have larger heads/builds. IN fact, I'm not sure if a human with long hair, or a lot of it, would be able to make it work either. The problem is the cuffs have to be extended to full length to cover my ears, which is never a problem for me since I have a small/medium sized head/face. I will note, however, I have my ears gauged to 1/2\" and this headset does not cause issues with that.",
          "Updated Review (05/23/22):Logitech reached out to me and sent me a new pair of headphones with a firmware update that can be installed online. They truly went above and beyond, and I have yet to experience any issues with this new pair. They've now outlasted my old pair by a sizeable margin, and my faith in this product has been restored. I would highly recommend these headphones as long as you are willing to look online on a computer to install the firmware before use with other products or your PC. They sound great, they're comfortable, and they have a great battery life. Thanks to Ambrose Lee of Logitech for showing me such kindness and for giving me absolutely above and beyond levels of customer service.Updated Review (10/20/21):These headphones are now having loads of connection and sound issues after just about a month of use. I've used them with multiple devices using the USB port and they have constantly had problems with random disconnection and failure to reconnect. I have done my diligence in attempting a lot of troubleshooting methods. There is no excuse for releasing a product that has this little testing, or advertising a wireless headphone like this with no option for connecting it with a 3.5mm audio jack when the wireless technology is this pathetic, shoddy, and unreliable. I would recommend avoiding these headphones at all costs.Initial Review:For about 3 and a half years, I've used Sennheiser HD 559 headphones for gaming at my PC every day. They sounded incredible and got heavy use. However, recently, they had come into having some issues, so I went on Amazon to check out their headset options.At first, I was going to purchase another hi-fi open-back headphone, but Amazon recommended me these Logitech G435 headphones, which featured wireless USB connectivity.I was intrigued about what kind of quality I could get for just $80 in a wireless over-ear gaming headset, so I decided to purchase them. I had used Logitech G433 headphones in the past and was very fond of them, and I have trusted Logitech for a long time, as they have always made solid products.This headset is no exception to that quality statement.Fit:I first want to talk about the fit. These headphones are not very big. However, they are just the right size for people who have smaller to normal size heads. I, though, have a decently large head. These headphones fit very well on me, but I had to adjust them nearly all the way to their max extension. Despite this, they rest very comfortably, give my ears plenty of room inside the earcup, and are pretty much exempt from producing any fatigue due to their astonishingly light weight of just 164 grams. The only complaint I have is due to the headband, which could have used far more padding, but it suffices as it is and doesn't cause too much discomfort.Sound:As for sound, they definitely don't match my previous headphones, the Sennheiser HD 559. But that's okay, because I didn't expect them to. These headphones pack in a decent quality microphone, wireless connectivity, high quality build materials, and above-average comfort for $20 less than the aforementioned Sennheisers at MSRP.In lieu of that, these headphones sound very good for their price. They sound almost identical to the Logitech G433 headphones, with even a little bit more clarity on the low end.It is worth noting though that these headphones will not do well at cancelling out any background noise, so if that is something that is important to you, I advise you to look elsewhere.Battery & Connectivity:The listed battery life of 18 hrs is pretty accurate from my experience, which is plenty of juice for multiple days of average gaming spans. As long as you plug the headphones in to charge every few days, they should never run out of battery on you.The connectivity blew me away. There is absolutely no noticeable latency, which is already an improvement over countless other wireless gaming headsets I've tried featuring USB wireless connectivity, with some being almost double the price of these G435s. I will disclaim, however, that I have NOT tried these with their Bluetooth mode, nor have I tried them on any consoles that support these headphones, only my PC.Overall Verdict:I have very positive opinions about these headphones. While they are definitely not perfect, they are a very good choice for the price of $80 in my opinion, and I plan to use these headphones as my daily gaming headset until it's time for me to move on again due to wear and tear. Good job, Logitech."

          "It is a really great headsets for gaming, I can hear sounds I couldn't hear before on my previous headsets. But the durability is pretty bad. The first G432 I bought lasted for like ~4 months, right earphone piece broke off and left dangling by the wire. I thought maybe I was too rough with it? Even though, I never dropped it or anything. I made a decision to buy another one because of how great it was but this time I will treat it with extra care. So I bought another G432 and this time it lasted for like ~4 months too, but this time the left earphone piece broke off and left dangling by the wire... Maybe my head is too big? I feel like I have an average size head...TLDR; Great gaming headset, really bad durability, breaks easily and left dangling, great if you have a smaller head?",
          "I am in insurance and I use these daily, after 3 months my voice is muffled and my customers cannot hear me.",
          "I have had 2 pairs over the last 8-10 years, only reason the first pair went out was the vacuum sucked up the cable.I got another pair and theyre great!. The mic is a bit quiet tho! I cranked up all my setting and in discord other have to turn me up too, but I never have issues with people understanding me. for the price, id choose nothing else",
          "At first, I wasnt too sure about getting a newer model of my G430, but after having taped up almost 70% of the plastic with ducttape to keep it together, plus having to resolder various wires back onto boards through the years, I finally gave up on them. Mainly because the most recent issue was deep inside the top headband, the wires going to the right ear, from the left, was not connected after stupidly going to far from the desk and having it yanked off my head. Sigh, mistakes were made, but enough of the sad story.These G432's are 95% very close to what I was hearing in my old ones, and thier not even \"broken in\" yet, as they say.. Aisde from not having an in-line mute/vol slider, its the same thing - only larger coils I believe. (or was it drivers, i cant recall what I read before buying)Either way, if your looking to replace your G430's, and dont mine the in-line vol/mute dongle, they are what you need. Get these. They are worth it in my opinion. I dont even bother using the surround dongle gadget, I never have. But now I have 2 of them! haha. Just a funny side note I guess.Oh, few more important things, the ears fit snug, same as the 430's but they changed the material from the blue cloth to some kind of \"leather\" as they call it, it adds am odd bit of chilly factor to when you first place them on your head, but its hardly a problem because its not a thicl material, it equals in temp to your head in say.. 1 or 2 secs. I had read a few reviews elsewhere that the 430's have small ear diameter, like - to fit your ears into? I have no clue what on earth they were on about because I have my old broken 430's right here next to the new 432's and they are the same thing. So yeah, dont worry about size stuff. Just buy the dang headphones! Game on!",
          "My favorite thing about these headphones is the rotating ears. I have a large head and wear glasses, so when I look for headphones I want to make sure they don't hurt my ears and fit my head. These headphones work great. The sound quality is fine; I don't think they'd be great for anything professional, but as a pair to use when you need to work, they're good.",
          "These headphones are very comfortable and I wear them for hours a day. I\u2019ve had these for 6 months and they have already cracked on the right side where the earpiece meets the top bar. I have been very gentle with them and they hang on a head phone hook when I\u2019m not using them. Not happy about this. Also I don\u2019t like how the software is needed to fill operate them. The G-Hub software auto updates even if you have that preference turned off and this ended up breaking the software for over a month for me. Logitech updated it, made you update, and then it wouldn\u2019t load, making most of the Logitech products paper weights. They finally fixed it, but they had to do it, I couldn\u2019t download an older version.In the end, I like the comfort, the sound and the mic, but due to the build quality and software issues, I do not recommend.*UPDATE* Logitech honored their warranty and sent a replacement free of charge. Definitely got to hand it to them on that. Hopefully these will last longer than the originals.*UPDATE 2* after receiving the replacement headphone they have been flawless. Still using them everyday and doing several voice calls with them a week.",
          "Seriously, she wouldn't let me upgrade hers after they were broken.  She loves these so much for her group gaming, College discussion teams and online classes, she wouldn't let me spend more money on upgrades. Most excited opening this present of all she received!.",
          "This headset is comfortable and it's not crushing my ears. The sound is awesome as well. I would recommend this headset.",
          "Bought these for FPS PC gaming and really like them, Just wish for media content that they could be a big louder like my HyperX cloud 2's were which is why I docked them 1 star.  the 7.1 surround on them is great for footsteps and sound quality overall is great.",
          "I got these back in July 6, 2021.Pros: For the price they are ok, they have a nice noise cancelling foam (as many gaming headsets have) they're comfortable to wear for hours of gaming.  I really like the volume wheel on the left side of the headset, I can easily lower or raise the volume of what i'm listening to.Cons: The microphone picks up noise from my room or even traffic going by and can be a tad bit annoying when in voice chat with friends or strangers in games. The microphone also isn't a flexible wire (which i was hoping it was), so I am unable to bend closer to my mouth or away. It can only go up and down. The cord is also an aux cord, I was hoping to have a usb or like most headsets have both, but that's my personal preference. The biggest NEGATIVE about this is both sides of my headset are broken now. The plastic is real cheap and it somehow cracked opened.. So both my headset pieces just dangle now. I had to use tape to put it back in place. They only lasted me 1 year before they cracked open.Conclusion: I won't be getting these again.. they broke in a year if not less. The microphone isn't great and the cord is an Aux cord.",
          "The sound is great. After about an hour playing a game they are uncomfortable. They squeeze too tight and too low on my jawline.Mic works good too. Cord is plenty long.",
          "I didn't like that a setting called \"side tone\" is on by default, which made me hear an echo of myself while I spoke. You have to visit logitech's website to find software for the headset to turn it off.",
          "I\u2019ve been using this headset for almost one year now and here\u2019s what I think about it. I\u2019ll cover general information first, then get more specific from a PC gamers perspective, then console, as I\u2019ve used these on both.IN GENRAL:- This headset has very good audio quality for under $50, so good it\u2019s shocking honestly. I\u2019m use to using headsets that cost $200+ and the G432\u2019s have better sound quality than those, so it\u2019s definitely worth buying!- The ear cups swivel and that\u2019s a very convenient option to have which some pricer headsets don\u2019t even have!- There\u2019s only one volume control option which can get a bit annoying. Meaning it will turn up/down chat and game volume at the same time so you\u2019ll have to get use to adjusting in-game audio options.FOR PC GAMING:- There\u2019s instructions in the box to register your headset on the Logitech site and download the dashboard so you can have full control of your headset.- The surround sound will work for PC.- The mic has a playback option which will allow you to hear yourself speak with the headset on so you\u2019re not screaming to talk. Some might not like this, you can turn it off on the dashboard, but it is very useful when you\u2019re trying to be quite but also enjoy your games.- The headset is very light and very comfortable. It can be a bit tight at first, but just keep wearing it and it\u2019ll eventually loosen up a bit.- The mic is extremely good quality and picks up everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Some might find this to be great, some might find it to be annoying.FOR CONSOLES:- For console users, it will be a stereo headset, not surround sound.- Regardless of not having surround sound, the stereo audio is surprisingly really good.- The mic remains very clear for your voice but will also remain sensitive; it will pickup everything.IN CONCLUSION:If you\u2019re expecting a top tier performing headset for under $50? You won\u2019t find it, regardless of what you read here. The G432 is a great headset (FOR ITS PRICE), not to say it\u2019s bad at all. Like I\u2019ve mentioned, the surround sound for PC gaming performs better than some $200+ headset I\u2019ve used. There are just some features I wish this headset had and it would be absolutely perfect IMO. All in all, I\u2019d recommend this headset for anyone who\u2019s not looking to break the bank, but would also like a quality headset for gaming.",

          "I really love this headphones, the quality feels great, only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that they arent very glasses friendlyBut other than that, this are great",
          "Comfortable \"can\" style headset,  sound is fantastic,  reliable,  has a long USB chord.Mainly used for gaming,  but also worked wonderfully for work at home.  I recommend this headset to my clients whenever they complain about headset failures.",
          "Headphone audio is great, it makes the gaming experience so much better. Fit is very comfortable and can play for hours on end without discomfort. However, I have 2 main issues that keep it from a 5 star rating:1. No matter how much I mess with my audio settings on my Xbox, the microphone echoes for people in my party. It makes it incredibly difficult to play with friends or online when every time I say something, they hear an echo on the other side. This also includes them hearing echoes of my in-game audio unless the volume on the headphones is turned down to an almost inaudible volume.2. The connection inside of the cord is horrible. I've had these headphones for about 2 weeks and continue to constantly have to wiggle the cord near the 3.5mm connection to get a clear connection without it cutting out on one earphone. When it works its great, but its really annoying to constantly have to do this every time I plug the headphones into the controller.You get what you pay for. Cheap headphones that work, but don't work as well as something better. I wish I would have splurged a bit more for something higher quality, and I did expect more from an established brand such as Logitech with these.",

          "Hey! I am a PC gamer,I've been a fan of Logitech headsets for ages, their G430 model lasted me 4 years, and only 3 days ago the wiring gave out, so I went to Amazon looking for its' current evolutionary sister/brother headset...The G432 arrived in 2 days to where I am at, with *free shipping*, neatly packaged, no harm from rain (it was raining when I wasn't home).I downloaded latest version of \"Logitech G hub\"(google it for download), installed that software, connected headset to its' USB adapter, played a bit with its' equalizer settings and.... WOAH!!!!! I LOVE IT!You don't have to create Logitech account, if you don't want to.Here are some useful tips:  For gaming - disable surround sound, enable \"Advanced EQ\" and adjust Equalizer to your liking (if you know what you are doing) or use a preset. I used FPS preset to test it out in a few Hunt:showdown rounds, it works very well.  For Entertainment (music/cinema) - enable surround sound, turn your PC/playstation volume all the way up, and turn your front/back/left/right etc. channels down (I went 6/11) and set your bass channel to max, you get incredible sound from listening to anything that uses Dolby 7.1 surround sound technology.\"BE AWARE!\" that majority of audio content on internet is not using that technology, so you have to specifically look for Dolby 7.1 surround sound enabled content... Youtube does have a couple of songs using that technology. If you are not listening to such content - turn off surround sound, as it will sound horrible!I am giving this G432 headset a 5/5 because it provides more sound quality for the buck than I could hope for.It also sits very well on my head (I have a relatively thin head shape), for somebody with really \"Thicc\" head shape I would suggest to skip on these.Mic sounds crisp and clean.I also like this headset design, although I assume it has the same weak-spot as G430 had, which is fine for me, as I know how to fix it.G432 has a nice finish that doesn't leave stains on the plastic parts from touching them with sweaty fingers.That's about all I wanted to comment on...Enjoy your sound!Serge",
          "Working very well, never had a problem with them. The way you can flip the mic up to mute is very convenient, but my favorite part was the volume wheel. It has a very good feel, does not feel cheap, and the best part is that the headphones have a separate volume from the computer so you can change the sound on both. The noise quality and mic isn't the best in the world, but for 35$, the quality is absolutely wonderful. Worth your money!",
          "Excelentes headsets, son muy c\u00f3modos, tienen una buena cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido y la calidad del sonido es excelente.",
          "I purchased these as an upgrade from my Logitech G230 which finally broke after 6 years of use. The build quality is overall a little better, and while I am a fan of the leatherette visually, this pair does feel a bit less comfortable and soft. The sound quality also took a surprising dip--the bass is very weak, the mids are muddy, and the highs dull. The microphone quality did improve compared to the older model.Lastly, the cable is very short. It barely reaches the rear of my PC that I sit on my desk--not even on the floor!! I had to purchase an extension; if you go this route and you use the headset mic, make sure you get an extension that includes microphone signal and not just audio.Overall I know this set will last me plenty long :)",
          "Product itself seems fine so far. It\u2019s easy to set up my only company is I bought a new set of headphones and received someone\u2019s returned product. The box had been ripped and the seal proven and the paperwork is all wrinkled in the box. Hopefully nothing is wrong with the set received.",
          "overall i liked this product, but personally i like to have my audio pretty loud, if you\u2019re looking for that this may not be the product for you",
          "Logitech is normally a very reliable company when it comes to its electronics, and I\u2019m glad I can say the same about this headset.  While the list price is $80, I haven\u2019t seen it priced above $40, which is what I got both of my headsets at (my first one broke, completely my fault!).Comfort wise, the cups have a bit of a particular shape but I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t fit all head and ear shapes.  They\u2019re comfortable and my ears don\u2019t sweat!All of the features work fine on it, too.  The volume slider is a bit to get used to since I\u2019m so used to just adjusting the volume on my machine, but it works just fine.  The mic isn\u2019t recording studio quality but it\u2019s perfect for gaming with friends over voice chat.  The mute feature works great, too, but every time I put the mic up there\u2019s a dull sound the mic picks up when I actuate mute mode.  Nothing major.Sound quality is good depending on what you\u2019re using it for.  For gaming and movies, it\u2019s great!  But just listening to music isn\u2019t as good as using my first gen AirPods.  Still, overall sound quality is more than just good enough.Overall, it\u2019s a great product.  I don\u2019t doubt there are better headsets out there, but this one is phenomenal on a tight budget.  Highly recommend!",
          "Gift for gamer he enjoyed",
          "I've had this headset for about two years, and I bought another one yesterday. For the old and new headset I had, wearing it for the first time hurt my head after a bit because it's tight. If you don't have a big head then good for you lol. Thankfully, wearing it often will eventually make it become less tight.The audio quality was also something I learned to become used to. Obviously it's going to sound or feel weird if you're accustomed to perceiving sound through a different headset, that was me the first time I got this headset, and there is a program you download onto your computer called Logitech G Hub that allows you to alter the sound settings such as toggling on or off the surround sound or the acoustics. There's also a volume scroll wheel at the back left cup of the headset, which is nice.The microphone quality isn't bad, but it isn't the best in the world either. I haven't toyed around TOO much with the setting of my headset, but I would hear people on Discord comment \"who's writing an essay?\" when I would type on my keyboard. So, if you're desperately worried about people hearing you type, stay worried. It's nice though that I can just flip my microphone up to mute myself.The integrity of the headset itself definite has it's faults. It's infamous for breaking at the area where I had to duct tape it. I'm sure if you take good care of it or don't use it 24/7, it'd last longer than the two years I've had it for. Be aware that this is definitely a real issue with the headset if you haven't already guessed by the several other reviews who show the damage in the same area of the headset. The padding also started to wear off around the time it broke, but I kept using it cause I was trying to save money. I decided to treat myself yesterday by buying a new headset so I didn't have to keep adjusting the duct tape on the broken side every time I wore it. Also, the cord is prone to twizzling/tangling up as well, but I never experienced a cord issue with the old one.Is it worth the money? In my opinion, yes once you get accustomed to it. That's why I bought it again and why I still used my broken one over a $100 Logitech G535 wireless headset I had bought before buying another G432. The mic quality, in my opinion, sounded a lot better on this $50 headset than it did the $100 dollar one.So all in all, make sure you take good care of it if you want it to last, and it takes a few uses to loosen it up so it isn't tight around the head and becomes more comfortable. Sound is fine as well once you've adapted to it. Is it the best headset out there? Definitely not. Alright for it's price? Yeah.",
          "Honestly I am not the biggest dude about sound, just need a headset that I can hear directional sounds ok and I'm happy. This has great sound for me and I'm happy on that end. The thing I am really bummed about is that it came with my mic not working which is a bit of a bummer. I need to comm to teammates in game and now will have to probably purchase another mic. This has made me figure its time to switch to desktop mic, headphone mics are just getting really bad.Edit: I luckily have an attachment that I found that let me use it in a usb and mic works, but I dont think someone should have to buy some converter for mic to work easily.",
          "I have long curly hair but I part it on top which thins it out, and the firm padding of this headset digs into my scalp painfully every time I use this for gaming. I\u2019m frequently adjusting the heavy headset during my gaming sessions - sometimes only an hour or so in. The cord feels extremely flimsy and vulnerable. It often gets caught up under my desk chair wheels, which is terrible. So far at least it still works. If you have pets that chew, I do not recommend this headset. I feel nervous just wrapping it up for travel. I haven\u2019t noticed one way or the other about noise cancellation. The sound quality is decent - nothing too special. Friends report my volume comes through fine (maybe too loud). It took me a long time to figure out that the mic was a flip up to mute since there\u2019s no manual mute button like my previous Logitech headsets had. Using Discord, I think it\u2019s a bit easy to pick up unintended sounds like breathing and sniffling with this mic. I can only adjust mic gain in settings so much. It\u2019s much better than a laptop\u2019s embedded mic though.I find this headset heavy and uncomfortable generally though and I\u2019ve never been happy I bought it. It does have lots of space for reasonably big ears. Bigger than mine. I had \u201cfade in\u201d sound issues with a previous headset - not this one - but otherwise I wish I\u2019d stuck with my old one instead. Hope to get something different from this one soon.",
          "Originally bought this for myself, then gave to my 8 year old because 3 different headphones I bought for her and each one crapped out after use. Found these were on sale again so treated myself to a new pair.",
          "This is a good headset. The sound quality is great. I like that the over the ear part of the headphone is moveable. I can easily adjust that part to fit into most areas on my desk and helps save some space. The microphone's audio quality is fine. It's not great, but it sounds decent. My only complaint about the headset is that it is too bulky and a little heavy for my head. My neck and head start hurting after a while when I wear the headset for a while.",
          "WOW! What a drastic improvement over my last headset! I thought this was a bit pricey, compared to my last headset. However, I've been using Logitech products for over twenty years, and have come to trust the brand for quality, reliability and long lasting products.  Given the deal off retail price, I went ahead and decided to treat myself for the holidays.I'm delighted with my purchase!! The comfort was the first thing that struck me. Well padded and no plastic or metal against my ears or face. The padding also meant great noise cancellation. Sound quality was exceptional for my use. I'm no audiophile or pro gamer, just a regular guy using these mostly for Zoom or Webex calls and occasionally to shut out the outside world with music while coding.",
          "I'd been using a Logitech headset for years (I think it was the G430 but I'm not sure) and it satisfied all my needs. When that one finally broke, I tried to find the same one buy again but no luck. Bought this one instead thinking it'd be an improvement but there's honestly not much to be happy about.The biggest, most disappointing thing is the fit. The earcups are a little small but still covered my ears so I'm meh about that. The main issue is the squeezing. I'm pretty small and my head is fairly average sized, but these headphones squeeze soooo tightly. For the first hour or so it's comfortable and creates a nice \"snug\" fit, but for any extended period of time, it's just unbearable. If you wear glasses, don't even consider these headphones. They press the frame into your head so tightly that it's uncomfortable after even a couple minutes.Couple other notes: there's no sidetone, which is fine but not ideal. I'm not a huge fan of having no mute switch, even though it does mute when you flip the mic up -- if you're in a video call, it's just super obvious when you're muted lol. I also have a cat and she destroyed the cable in the first week, causing it to lose sound in one ear. Cat's fault, but the rubber build does make it a little more susceptible to that.Sound quality was okay. Nothing to write home about, but definitely not as bad as some people on here were saying. Aggressively average, I'd say.Overall, it would've been fine and sufficient if not for the fit.",
          "Good headset, my only con is sometimes chat audio can be louder than game audio",
          "El equipo cumple con su funci\u00f3n, no tiene un sonido extraordinario, pero no suena mal.. relacion calidad - precio aceptable",
          "overall, this is a very good value.  Good sound, feels solid.  The ONLY issue I have is that I have a large head, and it gets absolutely PAINFUL to wear for more than a few hours at a time because the headframe is so stiff and doesn't give me any adjustability for the -width- of my head.  But if you don't have a big noggin like me, it's a great value.",
          "These are some pretty nice headphones. I got them for my fianc\u00e9 as a Christmas present and he loves them. The noise canceling works very well. He says that the quality was pretty good and it was easy enough to set up on his PC.",
          "The headphones I ordered had some damage but I received another pair as a gift for my birthday last week so I can write my review! I really like these. So far, they are more sturdy than other headphones I've tried, like the Corsair HS35, HS 50, and some lower end Turtle Beach headsets. They are a decent set of wired headphones and are reasonably priced. They have great noise cancellation and feel very comfortable over the ears. I've worn them for work as well as while gaming on a livestream and again, they are comfortable enough to be work for several hours.The mic is nice. I've had headphones with a removeable mic as well as others similar to these where the mic is attached but can be flipped up. I don't have a preference one way or the other but if you prefer to be able to completely remove the mic from the headset, these aren't for you.  What is missing from this headset is a mute button. I have a Plantronics Blackwire C3210 Headset and even that has a mute button. It DOES have volume controls though, which I feel is pretty standard but I thought it worth mentioning.Some units come with a velcro wrap for cable management when the headset is not in use. I notice that the damaged unit I received had one but this newer one does not.Overall, I really like this headset, it works well, good sound quality and noise cancellation, and is pretty reasonably priced.",
          "If you accidently drop these headphones on a hard surface, they will break and you cannot repair them.  For some reason that defies my imagination, I cannot figure out why they break so easily.I don't know a person who games and watches movies and shows on their computer that has never dropped their headphones by accident.  It happens.These headphones are a great product for the money.  I am on my second pair and I would by a third if I had to (LOL).",
          "Haven't had it for even a year and they never get moved around anywhere, literally just on and off my head and to the side of my PC, yet the cord is cracking and splitting horrendously. The cord constantly gets tangled on itself for no reason? It loves to curl a LOT no matter how much you try to fight it.",
          "If you're looking for a good mic under $100 this is your best bet, but I recommend a 2 year protection as this product will break VERY easily",
          "Purchased for my work from home call center job as well as gaming and love it for both! Very comfortable! I wear these for 8.5+ hours a day, 5 days a week with no complaints.",
          "I mostly use these for work on teleconferences and teams calls but I have tried them out for gaming.  Overall I am really impressed by the sound quality and features for the price.  The build quality does seem a bit cheap and they will not survive abuse so treat them as though they are fragile.  The emulated surround sound isn't as good as some of their slightly more pricey competition and really bad compared to a multiple driver actual surround sound headset.  It is much lighter than an actual surround sound headset though.  The noise cancelling is very good for call quality and effectively removes quite a bit of background noise.Ensure you have a USB slot for the dongle as most features require the dongle and the Logitech G app to function.",
          "1st star: It functions.2nd star: I've heard worse.I needed a backup headset. This is affordable and from a company I generally like.These meet the absolute bare minimums.The microphone works and is muted when in the \"up\" position.-Input sound stutters horrendously.-With all input options set to max it still comes out muddy and quiet unless you're all but chewing on the mic.-Boom arm has little to no positional adjustment abilityThe sound through presets is passable. With tweaking it improves to acceptable for low-end headphones, but still has issues.-Sound is generally hollow and borders on tinny. Manual equalizer adjustments are required.Build quality is what you might expect for a $20-30 range headset. Hollow and cheap feeling.-Headset body is reasonably durable despite outward appearance and feel. The boom arm is thick rubber, so don't expect it to hold any position you set it to.-Leatherette. If you're unfamiliar: imagine sweaty ears. This isn't a strike against them as leatherette is temporarily comfortable.-Weight. The earphones feel abnormally heavy. Against both my Sennheiser headphones and headset they're easily twice the weight and I have no idea why.For Logitech:Your headset game is horrendous. Stop churning out subpar products and actually put in more than the bare minimum amount of effort. I bought g930s over 10 years ago and I feel like I'm re-writing a review.",
          "Great for gaming. Although ears tend to get hot as with anything that completely covers your ears. Very happy with these for the price.",
          "I have had these for over two years now and really can't complain about much. I play video games and stream with them and have gotten comments on how nice and clear my mic is.Audio: I think the audio is pretty standard. Not the best you'll ever hear in life but in this price range it's amazing. I've been jump scared a few times not being able to hear someone come up to my desk so the noise cancelling is pretty decent.Mic: I thought that maybe I needed to upgrade my mic but I haven't found anything aside upgrading to an external mic that tops this. I love the flip to mute ability and use it frequently.Comfort: I usually start to feel the tiniest discomfort after about 5-6 hours which is plenty time for me most of the time. I have worn them longer and it's not painful but just a little sore when I take them off. They are on the lighter side and adjust nicely.Longevity: There's some slight wear on the headband part but that just started after all this time and they do rest on a holder in that spot. I did have some issues with sound stopping out of one earphone at one point, I think something became loose and so I just have to keep the volume scroll wheel on the actual headset in a certain spot now but it's not a problem because I never used that to control the volume anyway. It hasn't stopped working in a few months now. I haven't seen anyone else have this issue when it started so could just be a rare occasion and of course eventually they'll need to be replaced. For this price though I'd buy the same ones again and be set for a few more years at least.Comparison: I saw some HyperX Cloud Alpha S on sale and bought them thinking I was getting an upgrade and I was so wrong. The HyperX mic quality was so quiet I thought maybe it was just me but saw others posting online having the same issues. So far I haven't been able to fix it enough and in order to stream and not annoy talking with friends in Discord I'll be returning to using my Logitech headset for the foreseeable future. The HyperX was also much heavier and started to cause discomfort much sooner, maybe about two hours.Overall: Despite some minor issues these headphones have done really well for me and are better than other headsets I've tried that may be similarly priced. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a new gaming headset.",
          "I had been using a wireless headset for years, but I got tired of having to deal with the battery only lasting an hour. I've had these for a few weeks now, and they are a good replacement.Sound quality is good, and it does keep out outside noise. Surround seems to be accurate enough for my needs. However, as others have mentioned, they are tight, even on my head which is more on the medium size. I can usually adjust them so that I can wear them for a few hours with no issues, even with glasses, but it does take adjusting them each time.An issue I am having is that when I switch my computer sound to the headphones or away, they disconnect and reconnect (I am using USB). I haven't determined if it's an issue with the headphones or my USB ports. I have a feeling that it *might* be my USB ports, as the last time I updated those drivers I had so many issues I had to roll them back to an older version and I never tried updating the drivers again."

          "These headphones are probably the lightest and most comfortable ones I've had. I especially like the material they used on the pads, as I'm not a fan of leather or the super fluffy pads, or even the cloth-like pads. These feel better all the way around. I do kinda wish you could remove the mic part, like on some HyperXs, or at least retract it in like you can on some Razer headphones. It's not that big of a deal, but it would definitely make these even better.Sound quality is good. It's not some ground breaking quality that's gonna leave you dumbfounded with super strong bass like Bose headphones will, but the quality is still clear and crisp nonetheless.I don't really use the microphone, as I have an external mic I use for my computer.Finally, I love the color schemes. I chose the white and blue, since it matches my YouTube channel's color scheme and is one of my favorite color combinations.Overall, I would recommend this headset to anyone who doesn't wanna fork over hundreds of dollars for a higher end headset.",
          "The sound quality is about what you\u2019d get for this price range, pretty decent but not over the top. The mic switch is fairly nice to have and does not fall down automatically over time. Mic quality is about the same as every other gaming headset mic so fine but not as crisp.",
          "I get about 24h of actual runtime which is just enough true all day use or if you forget to charge at night can use it in the morning without having to charge first. Pretty fast charging in about an hour, seems to hold a charge a bit longer if you let it stay plugged it at 100% for an extra hour. Quality control is an issue with the volume knob as I have had problems on 2, having returned the first. The first had a constant high pitch hum that could only be party counteracted by adjusting the volume knob and putting the mic boom in the down position. The 2nd one was able to eliminate it with adjustment of the knob with the mic boom not having much on an effect. This suck in that you never want to use the volume knob and instead adjust audio via the desktop and is really unacceptable. The only reason I have kept is because I have found no comfortable alternative. Unfortunately none of the other brands have a good ear hole shape, so unless you have small ears, the pads will rest on them causing them to fold slightly. This is fine for uses under 1 hour, but any longer and a progressively worse pain occurs. Hopefully other manufacturers with better build quality will copy this style of design, or if Logitech updates the headphones to address the issues.",
          "These lightweight headphones are perfect for a long gaming sesh. The charge lasts all the way through, and I'm told my voice is clear and consistent. The flip up mic to mute is very intuitive.I find these headphones to be the most comfortable set I've ever worn. Does not squeeze my head. Does not squish my ears. Highly recommend!",
          "I got these at part of a bundling deal with the G213 Keyboard cost me 20 bucks to add the headset to the keyboard was really pretty affordable. They fit comfortable over my ears which are big so that was nice the head band scrunchy/ hammock not sure what that called was very comfortable. I Compared them side by side with some Corsair Voids also corded headset. The audio was noticeably more muted it was like the difference between talking to some in person and over the phone it cut off the top end of voices and noises.That said if you need a headset and 20 bucks is what you got and to put towards that this deal was solid. Definitely gonna keep using the Voids but I'm giving these as a gift to a friend who is in desperate need of a new headset. Still really happy with the buy.",
          "This headset worked great (albeit I haven't tried the removing the foam trick to see if the sound quality improves). They are comfortable for all day gaming wear. Microphone is not the best, but gets the job done. However, now I am just over a year (17 months) and the left ear cuts out and you have to jiggle the wire. I might have another week before it stops working altogether. And the disconnect is clearly right where the wire enters the headphone, so it definitely wore down inside. The rest of the wire is in great condition and the connectors are all perfect. Rather disappointed it broke down so soon for the price. Gaming equipment with heavy daily use isn't cost effective if they need to be replaced yearly.",
          "Anyone who rates these 4 or 5 stars doesnt know anything about headphones, or gaming headphones. I got these on sale for $85 after tax. So at a pretty good discount. I returned them.The good: They are extremely comfortable. They felt great. And if thats your main concern give them a shot. You can always return. The band was adjustable with two notches, and I have a decent size head and ears. The phones themselves are adjustable on a slide, which wasnt bad either but I could see that breaking. I take really good care of my stuff however so this may vary. They are extremely light and are all or mostly plastic.The bad: So on wireless headphone gaming headphones with a mic, sound usually isnt that great until you get up to 200 plus range, and still not comparable to most wired sets, but along with that caveat these are incapable of being \"loud\" either. The sound profile wasn't great but it was even below what I expected when I tested out a bunch of games.The worst thing about these headphones is the mic, it sounds meh but it picks up EVERYTHING. This was the biggest reason for my return. You know those people you can hear their entire house? Ya they probably have something like these. If you are sitting next to your computer for example, it will pick up fan noise, mechanical keyboard? Ya it picks that up too. And I have one of the quiet ones. The mic pop wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, but a pop mic filter wont help either of these issues much, I stuck one on there.I also contacted logitech about these just to see if I could fix one of these issues, either with the mic or low sound. Its not possible. Basically got the auto response from them, of which I already did all those things before contacting them.The battery didnt last long before I started seeing major dips in the charge but I didnt run them until dead. It didnt seem good however. But it could be inaccurate display of that on the top end of a full charge.The wireless range was okay, its seemed accurate to what the product has listed. I could walk in most areas aside from the patio before it broke up.There was a review on here that said, ya these are trash, and while I wouldnt got that far, I wouldnt tell anyone to get these. You can get WIRELESS headphones that are better for the price point. HyperX/Steelseries.If you do get these, DO NOT buy full price, I felt uncomfortable at paying 85 after tax once I realized how they were. But at $100 its a rip off.Either go wired or save for a better pair, if you want decent sound or mic, definitely pass on these. Im not an audiophile I didnt apply that level of scrutiny but if I did these would be 1 or 0 star aside from comfort.",
          "The headset is almost perfect besides when you put the microphone up to mute. It starts making a ringing noise, a high-pitched sounding tone until you put it back down and unmute.  I saw another review describing the same thing so some sort of design flaw there. Everything else is great so far but that noise can be irritating.",
          "Purchased below $100.They are not worth it above that.That being said, let's get on with the review.------------------------------------------------------Bought these with the intention of using it for gaming, and occasional remote work.They work great at both.The earcups are great at blocking outside noise, without making your ears sweat the way pleather earcups can.The mic and audio quality is great.Audio can be improved via Dolby Atmos, Microsoft Spatial Sound, or Logitech G HUB.The flip to mute mic is super convenient, and one of those things I appreciated more with use.The entire headset is super minimal, and feels durable. I'm not a fan of headsets with a ton of wheels and buttons and pleather that flakes over time, so these are perfect in that regard.It does have a few cons. The audio is great for the price, but not amazing. A wired headset of the same or lower price may sound better.It's wireless range is ok, and works fine in my small apartment, but breaking line of sight with the transmitter dongle can cause drops in sound reception.Another peeve when working remotely, is the battery saver feature that shuts off the headset after a preset time.It can be adjusted in software, but only up to a 30 min max at the moment. This becomes a problem during slower days of remote work. It does however beep to let you know it's has shut off.Last issue is occasional low audio volume despite the volume to set to max. The fix for me has been to enable and disable enhanced audio in windows sound settings (Win 11). It's easy to fix but not something one should have to deal with.Well that's it.Despite the cons, I really like them, a lot!Hope this helps folks make an informed decision regarding these headsets.",

          "I totally recommend these headsets. They are very comfortable and you can literally not hear anything besides the call that you\u2019re on I wasn\u2019t using this for gaming. I was using this for work. I never really had an issue with these at all but I did end up returning them because they were just a little too big for me, but I highly recommend these they are very good and they have a very long battery life as well. I work five days a week from 11 AM to 8 PM. Never had an issue with them dying on me. I would literally just charge them on a Sunday before my week started and I was good for the whole week .",
          "Amazing for the price, I don\u2019t think I have a small head but it was kinda big for me. The muffs are like a ventilated mesh and are super itchy and irritating for me, gonna see if I can get replacements. The band is also a little itchy but less annoying if it\u2019s over my hair. Cord was long enough and connected easily.",

          "I've been using a cheaper Logitech set of headphones since the fall of 2018.  I began online teaching in the early morning hours and weekends.  The set I got worked pretty well, I bought a second set.  But then I thought getting a colored set, more expensive, with a few bells and whistles would be great.So I wanted to upgrade and purchased two of the more expensive Logitech headsets .. that cover your entire ear.So, I'm nearly blind and rely on my sense of sound to compensate for what I cannot see.  I was unprepared for the sense of unbalance with the full ear cover set.  And I could not hear myself.  And I had to keep reaching up to pull them away from my ears to let the air pressure equalize.I have one bright child, Anna, who only lasted 15 minutes with the new set before begging me to put on the old ones.  (I can't hear you with that one .. it just sounds so different.)  We also tried the bluetooth set, and said the same thing.  I began asking my other students ... every one of them wanted me to use my old headphones.  Although one said the bright color was \"disturbing\" after seeing the black ones for 3  years.So, I'm going to return these.It was really difficult to get these to talk to my computer,  we ended up attaching them to the back (full desktop) and shortened an already too short cord.I kept hitting the volume buttons on the back of the ear when I would adjust them or let my ears breathe.I kept hearing myself yelling because I could not hear myself ... this made it hard to think.In the end, nice as they are ... they are not for me.  Very sad.",
          "Works great with my work equipment. Calls still come thru with mute on . Flip the mic to mute call and I can walk thru out my whole house and never interferes with call. They hold charge great. I work 10hr shifts and I can work 2 full days without charging. They power down after 30 mins or so with no activity . And I can have them connected to my work equipment and my personal cell phone at the same time",
          "These are not general-purpose headphones, if you want a set for gaming, they're great, otherwise, steer clear.  They're very comfortable, can wear them for hours w/o discomfort.  They emphasize the highs and cut out the lows, which makes them great for voice chat and gaming, but the worst I've ever heard for music, or at least the music I listen to.  It is clearly advertised as a gaming headset, so I can't really justify anything lower than 5 stars.  They do exactly what is advertised.",
          "I absolutely love my headset. They fit me very comfortably and the sound quality is fantastic. I haven\u2019t had an over the eat headset that is as comfortable to wear as these are. I got them on sale but the quality is definitely worth the price.",
          "One of the better set of headphones I've had",
          "I've had my headset for a little over a month. I game for hours and it's the most comfy headset I've had maybe ever.I usually buy mid-grade headsets, so take that for what it's worth. Had the PS Gold headset previously and as far as comfort goes, this is far better.",
          "Bought these for my laptop and so I could have something wireless so I don't get tangled in the wire while I keep getting up to attend to the kids or do some chore in the house. It is definitely plug and play and decent price.  This is my 2nd Logitech product that I've purchase and I can say it's not bad. I did have an issue once where I turned it on the 2nd day of using it and for some reason I could not get any sound in it. I went to my sound settings and made sure they were registered and they were but when I went to YouTube I saw the sound bar moving bit still had no sound.  After turned the off and back on a time or 2 it finally work.  Since then haven't had any issues.  Really great for traveling and gaming on a laptop and the quality is nice.",
          "So for reference I'm an audiophile and own headphones that cost well over $1000. So I'm probably going to bit a more picky about the sound quality.The build is solid for in expensive gaming headphones. The microphone quality seemed good enough for my teammates to hear me clearly.The wire is a little on the thin side but that reduces weight and makes it easier to manage, you just need to be careful to wrap it up when not in use.The headband uses a system simulator to the Steelseries Arctis line of headphone. I think the Arctis does it better but they also weigh more. That said the lightweight of the Logitech makes them just as comfortable, maybe even more so...The sound quality to my ears is decent for the price, not as good or puncy as some other headphones I own, but that's to be expected. If you take them for what they are, a budget pair of name brand gaming headphones they are pretty fantastic. Especially if you can get them even cheaper on sale.You can get better headphones, but they will honestly cost more, but you can get more expensive headphones that aren't as good as the G335.Overall I'd recommend if your looking for solid, inexpensive, wired gaming headphones... Or if you're like me, and you just think they looked cool and are cheap and want to give them a try.",
          "there are foam pads inside the headset that makes it sound less quieter just take those off and you got a pretty decent headset for gaming",
          "I will start off by saying i primarily use this headset for gaming. I just went searching for a new decently priced one after my old razor headset reached 3 years old. I was mainly looking for a fabric lightweight cuffs on the ears whereas my old one made me break out and get headaches from wear. After a week, I already feel so much better wearing this one! My only complaint, hence the 4 stars, is the mic. It\u2019s a standard built in mic. I just find as though i cut out somewhat more than i did with my old one. If you\u2019re buying this for the mic I would not recommend. The sound quality is great though and is very comfortable and would recommend for those aspects. Looking in to purchasing a separate mic would probably be your best bet. I hope this helps someone! :)",
          "Works great only downfall is dongle cancels sound even when headset is off",
          "Very nice Headset. Good Sound quality. I've read 1 complaint about the Mic volume being low. Be sure to go into your Sound Settings & Recording properties for the Mic & move the volume slider to 100%. It does not have a 20% DB Boost adjustment, but that will depend on what Sound card, or Chip you use like the Real Tech integrated Sound Chip on most Motherboards or a Plugged in Sound blaster Card in a PCI or PCIE Slot.This headset will function great as long as Battery power is above 50%. As it goes down below 50% volume levels will be affected, but this happens to everything Wireless with rechargeable Battery's. Just how it is. 35 hours of Battery life on this Headset. Light weight & clamping pressure is comphy.",
          "I work from home and needed something comfy and light. These are perfect!! Don't hurt my head after long hours and they actually last!",
          "These headphones are built to a very good quality. Better than expected for the price.The audio quality is very good, clear highs, crisp mids, and powerwelfull lows.The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because the travel on the height adjustment is very, very, VERY, little. Not much wiggle room. This may be good for teenagers, or petite persons.If it's any help. I typically wear a size medium/large 56cm bike helmet 7 and 1/8 hat/cap size and it fits small. I will probably look for a replacement.",
          "Bought these when they were on sale. The MIC does pick up background noises, if my husband and I are playing a game it picks up his voice too. I had to change settings on my PC to fix that but otherwise pretty good. Sound quality is great and its easy to use.",
          "\u00a0IThis headset was amazing, I purchased it a month ago and was surprised just how comfortable it was in comparison to my old headset. If your someone with pierced ears/ wears earrings sometimes headphones it\u2019s perfect because how comfortable the ear cups are and they are very large. The only thing that I don\u2019t really like about this is that I noticed something strange about the sound quality so I removed the earphones part and took away a little piece of plastic near the speaker inside it, also the mic sounds okay it\u2019s not amazing but it\u2019s usable.",
          "Overall, the headset is comfortable and light. The strap helps to ease the pressure on the top of the head along with the light weight. There's no discomfort with my ears and the mic doesn't have any issues outside of being sensitive enough to pick up my fan across the room. The battery isn't terribly long, but it lasts long enough.The worst, however, is the constant ringing coming from the left port. Holy crap, it does not stop. Music seemingly cancels it out, as does any loud enough audio. But it's annoying and shouldn't be happening.",
          "Pros:-Good sound quality-Very long battery, meaning you don't have to recharge it after every use-Comfortable for long-term use-Very nice and clear audioCons:-There can be a static buzz that can be heard in the left ear if you try to manually adjust the volume on the headset, can be eliminated by moving the wheel until it goes away.-Noise cancellation is poor on this headset, and since I wear glasses, my glasses separate the earcup from the side of my head a little, making the already poor noise cancellation worse.-Although the sound quality is nice, it leaks from the headset, meaning at high volumes you (and others_ will easily hear anything playing on the headset.Questionable:-I've heard from some people that the mic is great on this headset, and from other, that it isn't that good. Some of my friends say that it is bad, but when I test the mic on discord, it sounds perfectly fine. Don't really know how to feel about it, although I will say that without discord's noise suppression, the mic will pick up EVERY SOUND IN YOUR ROOM.Overall, this headset isn't bad, but it also isn't a must-buy. I would not recommend buying it at full price as I don't think it is worth $115. I bought this headset for $80 when it was on sale, and for $80 it isn't a terrible choice, especially for a wireless headset.",
          "Me had for over yearNot much problemHeadphone mic can pick up things you are listening to from the headphonesComfortableGot around 40 bucks or somethingGood sound but theres betterSummary, its okay but theres better options.",
          "Good set. Light weight comfortable. Mic sounds great to everyone on PS5. They said it sounds as good as my regular one. Sound is good. My only issue is the set I regularly use has deeper base. Plantronics RIG 800hs at about $100 range. My gunshots sound a little less hard. It's a good light weight, comfortable set though. Good sound for the price! I'm keeping it.",
          "This is my first gaming headset and I love them! They\u2019re cute, sound great, and I never have issues with the mic. There\u2019s not full noise cancellation but anyone who comes to talk to me just sounds muffled so it does block out a good bit of sound. I\u2019m never distracted by any other sounds in the house with these on",
          "Esta bueno pero esta incompleto",
          "My son got this for Christmas this year.He said the microphone was a bit staticy, but it was fixed with some fudging around.The audio quality is good and it is great for gaming",
          "Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super \"gamer-y\"... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless \"gaming\" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).",
          "i really loved the colors of the headset and mouse and altogether i like how they work. if the headset is too loud my friends can hear it so i\u2019m not sure if i have to fix settings or whatever. for a short period the left click button wouldn\u2019t do anything when i clicked it but it\u2019s been fine since. other than that it\u2019s a nice deal.",
          "My partner bought me the wireless Turtle Beach Stealth 700 2nd gen headset as a gift, which was very nice. I used it for Xbox. The sound quality was amazing, and I loved that it could connect to my other Bluetooth devices. Unfortunately, even with the \u201cglasses friendly\u201d feature, it was tight on my face/glasses and caused me headaches.I was looking for a replacement that would be comfortable/wouldn\u2019t put too much pressure on my glasses, but still delivered good sound. I decided to try this LG G335 wired headset.This headset is SO comfortable. It is super light/airy on your head, and the ear cushions are soft enough that it didn\u2019t put pressure on my glasses behind my ears or around my face. The sound quality is just okay compared to the Turtle Beach ones, however, they are also in totally different price ranges, so I didn\u2019t REALLY expect them to live up to the sound quality. If you are playing a game that doesn\u2019t really require you to hear \u201cdepth perception\u201d or which direction/how close footsteps are, this LG headset would probably be just fine. Additionally, if you\u2019ve never used a higher quality headset with surround sound, you probably won\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing, and this would work for you. Unfortunately for me, I was spoiled with the sound quality from the Turtle Beach headset, so the quality and noise cancelation on the LG headset fell a bit short.I still rated this 4 stars due to the comfort, look, and value! If you wear glasses and are looking for a light/loose headset, this could be the one for you!",
          "I bought some a couple years ago at best buy. My husband was so jealous of my freedom during gaming and the sound quality. He ended up getting some here and now he's happy. No complaints of lagging.",
          "It's a good headset but needed to return as it's not suited for those with a larger skull.",
          "I would say this is a really good headset for the price.Comfortable even with glasses.The fabric is nice on the ear cups. Never buying that fake leather crap that peals off and gets in my hair and all over the place.Mic boom is nice. Super handy to push it up and mute quickly. Good sound quality on the mic too.2 negatives I foundCord length is too short. Just needs another 2 feet.They say these are discord certified. But there are instances where I was playing a video that was playing through the headset and the mic was picking up the sound and playing it back. I have it on voice activity and automatic input sensitivity. The fix is either lowering the volume on what I am watching or turn off automatic input and set the db level my self but that sometimes does not work and I can get cut off because I talk with a low voice. Sometimes it stops doing this if I push the mic further away from my face.This is a five star headset but I am bringing it down to 4 only because they say this headset is discord certified but the mic playback tells me they don't certify nothing and it's just a paid partnership marketing scam. I really don't think they \"certify\" these headsets.Other then that the headset is great and I am enjoying it a lot. It's way more comfortable then my last headset. If you want a comparison to the HyperX Could wireless headset read below.When compared to the HyperX Cloud I, not the Cloud II. Both side by side have the same sound and mic quality. But Logitech headset wins on comfort. The Cloud headset lost it's durability on the band so the headset did not grip my head anymore and would slip off my head all the time.Ear cups on the HyperX would peel off and get everywhere. Logitech is fabric with nice memory foam. Much prefer logitech ear cups. Super comfy.The mic on the HyperX had no issues and really liked that mic. I would say HyperX mic is better only because the discord playback issue I have with logitech is sometimes annoying.HyperX wireless, I would say wireless headsets are worth. The fact that I can stand up and go to my kitchen while still talking and listening in discord is great.I do miss that about being wireless.With wired ones you have to set it down and stop the conversation to check on something.I would say get this headset but wireless.Best value LogitechBest quality HyperXBest comfort - LogitechBest durability - N/A still need to wear logitech for a little longer to find out.",
          "Grandson love them",
          "It is a good set of headphones,  but there is a very big problem - the volume wheel is behind the left earpiece,  and almost every time i pick it up, it also rotates the wheel , so i when i turn up a video game, i think there is a problem with it - but i just mute the headphone!",
          "I love the audio quality, but my teammates can hear EVERYTHING happening in my house around me through my mic. Never had that issue with my much cheaper hyperx stinger.And the volume wheel has a delay to it. Sometimes have to rotate it a few times before the game volume increases at all.I love the long battery life, lightweight, and ease of use.",
          "Los aud\u00edfonos tienen un excelente sonido y un excelente micr\u00f3fono, pero tienen un inconveniente y es que si yo estoy reproduciendo alguna serie o jugando un juego con d\u00edalogos, esos di\u00e1logos se escuchan si estoy en una llamada en Discord y todo el mundo puede escuchar lo que estoy viendo, lo cual es inc\u00f3modo y siempre hay que mutearme para que no puedan saber qu\u00e9 estoy viendo/jugando",
          "It\u2019s nice",

          "I'm very happy with these headphones. They're not noise cancelling, but they dona great job of blocking out a lot of noise with their thick but comfortable cushions. Size is adjustable, which I love as I have a large head and I have no complaints there.Sound quality is great for both gaming and work meetings, and raising the mic to mute is super handy. As long as you're not the type to be listening to FLAC audio files, these great for what they are.",
          "These headphones aren't bad. I fell for the marketing of the cute colors instead of looking critically at the product quality. I wouldn't really say the noise-cancellation is any different than a regular pair of headphones. And the sound quality is fine for gaming but if you also plan on listening to music with these I'd suggest something else. I've since moved onto a HyperX set and am much happier."

I needed a headset that wasn't so tight and suffocating on the ears.This headset isn't suffocating tight on the ears, the calls are crystal clear, no static, no audio problems.

          "I bought two Logitech headset models for work use (with Microsoft Teams).  The models were Logitech Zone \"Wired USB\" version ($115.00) which is \"MS Teams certified\" and Logitech Headset H390 ($29.95).Maybe I'm crazy but I like / prefer the sound, fit, feel and long term comfort of the lower priced H390 headset.Both claim to be Noise Cancelling.PROS of the H390 model:Has a warm sound but is not lacking trebleMicrophone has a gutsy pickupDelivers music playback surprisingly well!Noise Cancelling may be superior to the Zone!!  (even with air conditioner 2.5 feet away!)Good volume oomph!  (i.e strong microphone pickup & output, strong headphone speaker volume).It has a normal, standard sized, USB \"A\" plug.  (Thank You!!! Thank You!!!)---------- Vs. -----------Logitech \"Zone\" (wired version)*  Way more money*  They ship it with a USB-C type plug (I later found a Logitech provided tiny adapter that converts it to USB-A end plug).  My personal bias:  I don't consider USB-C to a hardy connector.  It's (to me) the unfortunate wave of the future.  Yes I know all of it's feature improvments, I personally just don't like it.  Had I noticed it was USB-C, I would not have ordered it.*  The Zone plays stereo music back but music sounds better to me on the cheaper (H390) model.*  The cord on the Zone has this woven outer skin wrap that resembles \"cordura\" (the nylon backpack woven fabric material)  that has the effect of creating microphonics whenever it inevitably rubs against my shirt (yes I'm using the little clamp provided on the cord - no difference).  In short - physical rubbing (when you move) your shirt or your body against the outer cord material can be heard as a raspiness (like grrr / rrrr)  in the headphones and it's annoying to me.  It sets my teeth on edge.  Some many not notice or be bothered by this, it bugs the hell out of me.WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE LOGITECH ZONE?*  Uhh it looks cooler.  It has the visual cool factor.*  It has more treble, it's clear and refined...YET... I cannot say that, overall, it has the most balanced sound - especially for long hours of wearing.*  The noise cancelling on the Zone works, I think, but noise cancelling success seems to be more immediately apparent to me when using the H390.MY VERY BIASED OPINION OF THE \"ZONE WIRED\" FOLLOWS, OK?  YMMVIf you:1)  Need headphones with a USB \"Type C\" male plug as your native, out of the box , connector...2)  Want to look cool wearing a headphone with more modern styling3)  Want to unnecessarily part with an additional $90 dollars4)  Don't value long term comfort.5)  Don't need the ability to listen to music enjoyably in your off time (due to a fuller range warm and balanced sound)6)  Can live with the fact that the inline mute switch is not hardy and the flexible surface skin of the switch will quickly deteriorate...Then nothing is stopping you from ordering the Logitech Zone.Yes, I know that music playback is not a primary focus of these headsets, that may have been a low blow.  For my ears and body the lower priced Logitech H390 delivers the audio and comfort goods for way less money.To be fair:  Some people with different head types may do better with the Zone.  My head is medium to larger sized.  My PC is Windows 10, both headsets were discovered immediately once plugged in.MORAL OF MY STORY:  Spending more money does not necessarily deliver better outcomes.  Sometimes it merely delivers \"cachet\", bragging rights and complication.ADDENDUM:  8-28-2020:  I am returning this Logitech Zone headset as the plastic cover for the inline Mute switch is degrading at an accelerated rate after very little use.  I added this issue above to the reveiw.",
          "When I began teaching online the fall of 2018, I bought my first pair of these headphones.  I taught every morning for 4 hours and Friday and Saturday night for 4 - 6 hours.  So these were well used.  Currently, my son is still using them.I bought a back up pair in early 2020 and they stayed in the package for another year before my son needed an emergency pair and I gave the old ones and wore the new ones.The mic arm on that pair has always been tight and awkward ... and sometimes it gets stuck and I have to wiggle the base a bit to get it to turn.So I wanted to upgrade and purchased two on the more expensive Logitech headsets .. that cover your entire ear.So, I'm nearly blind and rely on my sense of sound to compensate for what I cannot see.  I was unprepared for the sense of unbalance with the full ear cover set.  And I could not hear myself.  And I had to keep reaching up to pull them away from my ears to let the air pressure equalize.I have one bright child, Anna, who only lasted 15 minutes with the new set before begging me to put on the old ones.  (I can't hear you with that one .. it just sounds so different.)  We also tried the bluetooth set, and said the same thing.  I began asking my other students ... every one of them wanted me to use my old headphones.  Although one said the bright color was \"disturbing\" after seeing the black ones for 3  years.With their urging, I bought a third pair of these.  Not so comfortable at times, especially at the beginning, but they do loosen up over time.There is a volume / mute button on the cord that ONLY affects the volume ... and it is super easy to run my hand down the side to adjust volume with each student and to mute myself for a cough or to talk to my kids for a second.Some kids claim that they can hear everything going on around me, and others don't notice it.  Only a few of my students use headphones or earbuds.I'm still teaching my same schedule here as 2023 progresses.  And still wearing the same headphones.",
          "Good price, comfortable on the head, good sound, cord is long enough, no issues with the controls or microphone.  I use it to work from home and watch videos, this is all I need.",
          "I've had a pair of these for, probably 4 months now. I purchased them for about $27. For that $27 you get a no frills headset, but also not a piece of crap. The headset is, overall comfortable. The mic, works, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. This is intended to be a VoIP headset more than a Gaming headset. So there are certain limitations. Don't expect a fantastic Surround Sound experience, but Stereo is pretty ok. The acoustic range is pretty good, but they do struggle on the low end; fizzling out around 40Hz at a comfortable listening volume. Additionally, the speakers can get distorted/garbled if there is too much going on. For example, an action scene with lots of explosions, sound effects and speaking, may sound more like radio static than any real sound. While the ear cups are comfortable, the pleather does not breath, so expect sweaty ears after a couple of hours.The mic is ok, while you are audible and understood, the mic is far from what could be called 'crisp'. The mic arm also tends to struggle being set where you want it. The friction holding mechanism just wears out after a week or 2. I have my boom arm supported by a long velcro cable tie to keep the arm at a good mouth height.User warning, the in line mute feature is a software mute. Meaning, if you are in a Discord channel, and moved to another channel; though the inline indicator shows you as muted, you are not muted.Bottom line, if you are looking for a headset to 'get up and running' this is not a bad purchase. If you are looking for something robust and life changing, this is not for you.",
          "I use this headset for working at home, the sound is clear, volume and mute work. Thick cord and is long enough to work comfortably or even stand up and grab something away from my desk nearby without taking headset off. The color i love and these are comfortable.",
          "Ear comfort is important to me. I usually wear a headset all day, while working. These are well padded and sound great. I've been wearing these for hours and my ears are feeling no discomfort. Easy to use with the inline volume/mute buttons. They also sound great when listening to music. Recommended purchase. Can't really beat this price for what you're getting. Fast shipping!!",
          "As a person who values noise cancelling earmuffs when using computers, I find this to be somewhat lacking. The earmuffs fit loosely and don't cover the ear, although I find them to be very lightweight and comfortable, which is awesome working from home and having to wear these a lot. Great sound quality and volume control.",
          "I just got my headset yesterday and it is fantastic! The sound quality is great and the mic picks up my voice easily. I like the buttons on the cord. My one complaint is the tightness on my ears. I have a small head so I don't understand how the average person can wear these comfortably. Maybe if you're wearing for a short period of time you'll be OK. I've been using them for 2.5 hours and my ears are killing me.",
          "Pretty good headset. You won\u2019t be able to wear these all day, they will hurt your ears since they are kind of tight and the cups aren\u2019t large enough for the entire ear. They work great for me because I only need to put them on for talking on the phone. Sound quality is better than expected, great value in my opinion.",
          "I was surprised by how good these headphones were and noise cancelling actually works.",
          "I purchased this headset in anticipation of return to office and wanting to have a noise-cancelling mic to cut down on the background noise when when I'm speaking. So far, coworkers on video calls have commented on the clarity of my voice which means the headset is doing its job.Only things preventing me from providing 5 stars is that 1) the cord is long and I find myself accidentally pressing on the mute button and 2) the band is still tight and not fully comfortable when wearing for a long period of time.",
          "Comfortable for work at home for a 40 hour week.  I put it on the computer tower at night to loosen it up a bit at first.",
          "I like this headset, especially for the cost. It's a good affordable option. I haven't put the mic into enough practice yet to ensure just how noise cancelling it actually is-- also because I'm not at the other end of calls. I got it for work and it does the job. Only frustration is that my ears start to hurt pretty soon after putting them on in the morning. Again, it's a budget product, so I can't be very mad at that.",
          "Hasta ahora no tenemos quejas y estaba a muy buen precio en esa oportunidad",
          "Muy livianos, buena calidad del material y del audio pero no me resultaron muy c\u00f3modos",
          "Easy to 'install' -- plugged in USB cable and selected 'Logi-USB Headset' and I was good to go. Using primarily with google voice.",
          "I teach online so these get used in a quiet and sometimes not so quiet online classroom setting. The sound quality is good so no issues there. I will say the small round earpads are not conducive to blocking out sounds from around you such as my dog licking his paws, the cat drinking from her water dish, or someone using the icemaker in the other room.",
          "The sound quality and microphone are good, no complaints there. I thought the call button was a mute button....it does NOT function as such, and doesn't hang up Teams/Zoom calls, not sure what it does as I don't make regular phone calls through the computer.The wire is more annoying than i thought it would be.My biggest complaint is the comfort or lack thereof. The ear pads are not very comfortable or soft, and the headset is VERY tight even on my very small head, and ends up hurting my ears in short order.Realized very quickly I wanted wireless, being tied to the computer (literally) doesn't cut it lol.",
          "I purchased these for work, as I'm not taking/making a lot of phone calls through the VoIP and using my cell phone I was having complaints that others could not hear me.  I was specifically looking for something that was hardwired into my computer to avoid any distortion during the call.Everyone hears me well, I hear them but the padded ears are small and I'd guess these are designed for a child v. adult.  I've look everywhere for a larger, over the ear headset (both ears not just one) and was unable to find it.Due to the smaller eat padded coverage, I do have to take them off every 30-40 minutes to give my ears a break as the compression hurts.Overall, they do exactly what I purchased them to do, absent the small ear pad coverage.",
          "I purchased one in 2015 and worked great for years on Win 7.  When I moved to Win 10 -- without problem.  When the pandemic hit, I bought a second set in 2020, but COULD NOT GET THE MICROPHONE TO WORK, so I eventually threw them away.  I bought a third set in 2022 and the microphone didn't work on that one either.  Searched the Internet high and low for a solution and never could find anything useful.  Logitech support is virtually non-existent for this model.  However, after spending several more hours on this issue in January, 2023, I finally figured out the problem!  For some reason these newer headphones were linking up to a Realtec USB driver, not the Logitec driver like the 2015 set.  The headphones always worked on every set, just the microphone was apparently dead.  I uninstalled the Realtec driver, including the option to remove the software; unplugged the H390, waited a few seconds, then plugged them back in; Windows reinstalled the driver -- and at long last THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM!Countless times I attempted to update the driver and Windows would report that the latest driver was already installed.Pros:  very cheap, decent audio quality.Mixed:  the inline volume control is always getting hung up on stuff, but when in meetings I like having my thumb on the mute button ready to jump in and out of the conversation.Cons:  I know plenty of other people are suffering with the above driver problem and all the advice I've seen online is worthless; Logitch support for this product is meaningless.  My body chemistry apparently melt the plastic cushions of the on-the-ear headphones after a couple of years.  Don't know if others have observed something similar.",
          "I prefer bigger ear pieces as far as the headphones, but that's preference.  The sound on these are amazing. I hosted my class using these and there were no issues with feedback or clarity of sound. Definitely worth the purchase!",
          "Item works very well, I connect to my laptop and can hear the meeting very clearly. The people on the other end hear me really good as well. Recommend product.",
          "Easy USB plug and play head set.  I use it to game while my husband is doing his work at our desks next to each other.  Great for jamming to music.  Just you can i let go as far as the cord lets you.",
          "I haven't had any major issues since I bought it a couple months ago. My only two issues is the mic part doesn't swivel back and forth in case I want to switch ears, and it's plastic so I can't bring it closer to my mouth when I'm dealing with an elderly caller who has issues hearing. Otherwise, good headset.",
          "Johnny Rocco checking in waiting for the weather to clear from Key Largo as I fend off Bogart and try to get some hospitality from Bacall \u2026too much to ask ?Anyhow started a remote job 18 months ago ( love remote )  and ordered this headset and they are great for turning down the volume in Team Chat not interested in there dramas and turning up the volume when making an OBC as the job requires from time to time .  I had an accident yesterday when tripping over wires back of the tower which crashed to the floor and broke the clip on my headset that plugs into the tower .  For 18 months not one problem from this headset except breaking them in a clumsy act of sheer calamity  .  I did not hesitate to order a new headset same one which arrive today so Johnny Rocco can turn down the volume in team chat come Monday .  Great price great headset .",
          "Good Sale",
          "This headset does the what it\u2019s supposed to. It\u2019s comfortable and has the ability to mute your voice. No chance of someone hearing you chew while on a webex call! No complaints.",
          "The sound is lacking a little base but the mids and high hats are clear. The ear muffs are a little and feel tightly pressed around the ears. It feels sturdy and good quality compared to similarly priced ones. The microphone works well but feels a bit fragile when moving. If you want a decent sounding, good quality headphones, this works. And the cord has a USB connector.",
          "They work for everything but nintendo switch ! Least i couldnt get em to work.Also, the Logo was black instead of white? kinda threw me off. Physical quality was good, certainly dont feel as cheap as they are. Sound was good. Not sure about mic quality as i only tested to see if it registered on pc.",
          "While I would probably not call these audiophile, they sound pretty darn good. Way more than adequate for work usage. I bought these back in 2019 and they still look and work like new. I use them for work. Probably the best $20+ I ever spent. I am ordering a 2nd pair for my personal computer. BTW I have a fairly large head, and they are comfortable.",
          "This is my second pair of these headphones. The first pair lasted over 6 years and failed after a break in the wiring. I got my money's worth for sure. I get many comments online about how good the mic sounds. At this price you can't go wrong.",
          "I was hesitant to buy these at first because I did A LOT of research.I've come to the conclusion that headphone research is slanted with a ton of personal opinions.I decided to try them anyway and I'm not disappointed in the least.They're comfortable. They sound decent for what they are.They get the job done. And that's honestly all I required.",
          "Love this headset! Perfect for gaming and work",
          "Headset sound is great and easy to use, just plug in USB. The speaker arm is fixed to the left side only and can\u2019t be rotated for right side use. I wear glasses and behind my ears are hurting with the headphones on for more than 1 hour. Hopefully this eases up with extended use. Overall they work well so far.",
          "Good price, easy use and setup, fairly reasonable sound quality.  Slightly larger than I\u2019d hope and the mute does NOT sync with Microsoft Teams calls.  I can\u2019t speak to other software interfaces.  The Teams interface is a minor nuisance and aside from it, I\u2019d recommend these",
          "I don't normally write reviews but felt compelled for these headphones.  I just started working from home and these are amazing.  My dog can be barking his fool head off downstairs and no one hears anything.  These are great for anyone working from home that needs to be on the phone or in meetings.",
          "So, I\u2019ve got a set of these at the office where we talk about sensitive classified stuff. Not sensitive like you\u2019re relationship with your cousin, but national security, sensitive. Anyway, we have to be cognizant that the Chinese are pretty much always trying to listen in on us. These are what they gave me, so I ordered some for my home office. Hope they work!(frets nervously)",
          "I use them for tutoring online and they are perfect! Easy on the ears...not heavy at all.Very worth the price!",
          "Great for remote work. Use them for my Teams calls and they don\u2019t pick up background noise like landscapers or dogs barking. Lite weight not bulky.",
          "When I first purchased this headset, it did was I needed it do to. I was on mutiple zoom calls and meetings where background noise wasn't a major concern. I didn't see the need to pay attention to the noise cancelling feature but as time went on I started a wfh job which definitely requires minimal background noise. That's when I realized these weren't a great fit for that; given my situation of having a little one at home. I recommend these for someone who has a quiet background all around because these definitely pick up the noise around you VERY well. They are great on sound and volume and pretty much a great headset BUT if you don't want your background be apart of your conversation. I wouldn't recommend.",
          "Noise canceling, volume is perfect with a great tone",
          "These work perfectly especially for such a low price! Much easier to buy these than fix my dysfunctional family!!! I work from home and needed a cheap option while I have family in town because they don't seem to understand working from home is real job and talk during my meetings.  My colleagues said they didnt hear background noise and could hear me perfectly.  The sound was decent for me too.  I live alone so there is no reason to use headphones normally, so I didn't want to spend a lot on something I only use a few times per year.  These worked!",
          "Working from home, I use the headset to talk on the phone with coworkers. When my pets bark/meow in the background; I ask if they can hear that & apologize for the noise. But, coworkers say they can't hear anything in the background.",
          "Got a pair of these for work in... 2014?  and bought a pair for myself.  One of them has finally about given up the ghost, so I wanted to eulogize it.This headset has been a solid, dependable piece of kit in my tech life.  Reviews of my sound quality during conference calls have always been good.  Crucially, it has its own mute button and a mic that can slide up out of the way.The playback quality is pretty good.  You won't get amazing bass out of them, but they are a hell of  a lot better than the built in laptop sound, and don't suffer too much bleed to the area in general.They are padded, but don't confuse that for sound proofing. When I throw these on to focus, I won't realize my coworkers are talking to me, but working at home, my dog's barking pierces these like an arrow.The plastic of the head band is somewhat supple, which is a blessing and a curse.  You get a little more flexibility out of it, but it will also start to flex in nerve-wracking ways.  Throwing these in a backpack requires a prayer or spell in hopes that they come out in roughly the same shape.A couple of hours is about all I can stand to wear these in a stretch before starting to get a headache or cauliflower ears. The ear pieces slide down, so there is some level of adjustment, but they will only really want to get so wide.The cord is incredibly long.  I've had a foot or two of it wrapped up into a little coil with a twist tie and seldom have cause to unfurl it.  The mic mute and volume controls are on a little plastic piece with a clip that you can kinda clip to the upper half of the cable (thinner gauge) so it's a little closer to hand.Speaking of the volume controls, they are very sensitive, and it's very easy to lean against them and suddenly find your volume at 0% or 100% before you realize what's happening.The failure of my pair has been a slow process over a few months of mostly light daily use (30-60 minutes of meetings on average).  They would sometimes not be recognized by Windows despite not being unplugged any time recently, but replugging would generally resolve this.  Then one of the earpieces developed a loose connection and would occasionally lose sound until I wiggled the wire a bit.Will I get another pair?  I think I'll see what else has appeared in the last 8 years since I first started using these.  But I still have my backup pair.Do I recommend these?  I know many of the points in this review seem rather negative, but consider: this is a device that I have continued to use over the course of 8 years.  That relationship has required some adjustments and sacrifices,  but ultimately has served well.  I ended up recommending them for an old company to use as standard starter kit for new hires, and I continue to think they have a place in the office.",
          "I was surprised at how well these worked. I wish it had more bass. I also wish there was more cushion on the ear piece.",
          "The headset tends to cause the ears to hurt after 2 or 3 hours of wearing them, the boom mic is ok, but you either must talk loudly or re-train your voice recognition software because the mic is not adjustable and does not clearly pick up the words said. as for using it with video chat systems or VoIP it is okay for others to understand you. the day after I wrote this review above, the microphone stopped working. Contacted Logitech support and got told I would have to contact the support from where I purchased them. So contacted Amazon support who contacted Logitech support who after going through all the required steps tells amazon support and me that they will send out an replacement which I should get in 5 to 7 business days. After 5 business days Logitech supports recontacts me and wants all the testing redone and tell me that they are not sending out the replacement as they told Amazon Support and me!So If anything goes wrong with your Logitec products Just throw them away, or better yet DO NOT BUY LOGITECH PRODUCTS ANY MORE!",
          "I like a lot about these headphones, but I am about to buy something different to replace them.  Depending on the day I spend between 2 and 10 hours on meetings, and use this headset for them all.Pros:  sound comes through well, microphone picks up voice well.  They are also light and pretty unobtrusive.Cons: the Mute button on the cord seems to have a life of it's own.  To call it hyper sensitive is an understatement... it really does seem to respond to NEARLY touching something.  It is also VERY poorly place; for me when I have the headset on the Mute button hangs almost perfectly at the level of my desktop, which means that it bumps against my abdomen and the desktop frequently.  This combines to cause accidental unknowing muting that is not reported in any way, and doesn't trigger the \"muted\" state in any major online meeting software that I have seen.The end result of this issue is that you will mute yourself and not know it, and this muting at the headphone level is separate from the software muting in Teams, Zoom, gotomeeting, etc. So you may be talking away without anyone hearing you.  Which eventually gets pointed out and interrupts the flow of what you are doing.So even though all the desirable features of this headset work great, it has this one significant flaw that is in something that no one was asking for.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm now looking to get a new headset again.  Probably go back to Plantronics, unfortunately.",
          "Since I did not pay a high price for these, I did not expect the sound quality to be so impressive. Clear as a bell! They feel sturdy and fit my head just fine. Great product for the money especially!",

          "So one of my first gaming mice was a little like this one but it was shorter.  It was nice and it lasted a long time but a little too short so it became uncomfortable after a while.  Then ai got a razor which was great but too tall.  This mouse is great because it feels nice and robust like my first one and it is just tall enough for me to cup my hand in it comfortably for long time.  The only criticism I have with it is there is only 1 DPI button and too many DPI settings.  You have like 4 settings of DPI so you have to go through 2 extra to go back to your favorite one from something more precise.",
          "",
          "Overall, the actual performance is very solid, especially for a wireless mouse. It is responsive, accurate, and very comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. There are occasional signal interrupts, but they are brief and uncommon.My big complaint is the battery life. The \"400+ hour battery life\" claim is very misleading. To achieve 400 hours of battery life, you will need to use \"High Efficiency mode,\" which drops your polling rate down to 125Hz. At these settings, the mouse becomes almost completely unusable with the cursor skipping across even when simply browsing around your desktop.Very solid mouse overall, but you can reasonably expect 100-150 hours of battery life on a pair of AAA batteries. Happy gaming!",
          "I'd been using a $6 mouse prior to this purchase, that $6 mouse tracked well on any surface, had presets for DPI that you could swap through, and lasted for 7 yrs. I'm not including it in name because that mouse is no longer sold. When it finally bit the dust on me, I found myself wanting something nicer quality, there was a limit on how many inputs the old mouse could handle simultaneously that had made it feel limiting sometimes while gaming. To address this, I thought I'd buy this gaming mouse with it's fancy sensor and most importantly higher simultaneous input limit. However, I also was using mouse pads from the late 90s and in being old they had scratches on them that caused my new mouse to track inconsistently out of the box. My best guess as to the cause was that it's a result of the mouse reading the scratches in their surface as me lifting the mouse to readjust, which caused the mouse to not read directional input until it was back down against the pad. This is a feature and I don't fault the design, but I did have to buy a new mousepad to make this mouse functional for me, while these old pads still work perfectly fine for a less sensitive mouse. 4 stars for ergonomics because it is smaller than average so not for people with big hands.",
          "Bought this for the kids that wanted me to make them a basic gaming rig.  For the $20 I paid I can not complain and thinks its a pretty solid mouse.  It has some cool RGB lights to help bling out the PC so the kids are happy and seems to function perfectly as a mouse so not issues with this item.  I would recommend if you want a basic mouse that lights up for some color.",
          "The scroll wheel had an issue from the start, tilting to the right side and middle click was working worse and worse till it stopped registering clicks completely. You can feel the click when you press it, but there's no signal sent by the mouse. Any other mouse works fine.After some consideration I gave it one more star, since this mouse lived longer than Logitech and ROG I used before. This mouse never had any doubleclicking or scrolling issues the other mice were plagued with. Maybe I was just unlucky with the middle click issue.I risked to try their other model: amazon.com/gp/product/B093LSC9KY",
          "Mouse arrived today and setup with my Surface Pro 8 was easy.Packaging: Mouse and packaging arrived in perfect condition. Two Triple-A batteries were also included.Quality: The overall quality of the mouse is a glossy matte black finish which looks very looks good in my opinion.Battery Life: I will update this review in 6 months with a battery report.Overall thoughts: This mouse is a nice addition to my minimal travel setup. It also comes equipped with a USB DONGLE for 2.4 connection option. I personally won't be using it but good to know its an option.",
          "Exactly as described. I really like this brand. Bought the wires for my son and he wanted the wireless for a Christmas Present. He loved the ease of the mouse and it's easy and fast set up. Will definitely continue to buy this brand. Hasn't disappointed yet",
          "Purchased this mouse in Jan. '22. Wanted a gaming mouse that was supposed to be more durable than typical PC mouse, and have programmable buttons. Rival 3 was touted as ambidextrous (I am left-handed), and it is in form, but the buttons are not, and I cannot work them well on the left side of the mouse in the middle of the mouse. If they were more towards the front left side on the left, I could use them better. But now I don't even use them.Big issue is the mouse goes dead from time to time. The LED lights stop, and its as if the mouse was unplugged, even though it isn't. It's done this now 3-4 times, so I keep another standard logitech mouse close, and plug it into the front of my PC so that I have some control of my PC. The Steelseries Rival 3 has come back on after a while, but right now its dead and isn't turning back on. It is a corded mouse and does not have batteries to it. so....overall this mouse seems to be a hit or miss for the money spent on it.",
          "The mouse itself is wonderful. I got used to it pretty fast and is completely usable. I just can't stand the fact that when scrolling down, it squeaks so much! I tried blowing in it, using compressed air. Maybe I just got a defective one though.",

          "The Steel Series gaming peripherals have been staples for the last few years. They're solidly built, work right out of the box, and are responsive as anyone can wish for. They were close to the apex accessories of the time, and still live firmly near the top even years later.The Steel Series Rival 3 is one such mouse. It's solid, smooth, responsive, ergonomic, and has just enough weight to not be classed like one of those cheap knock-offs while still being light enough to move fluidly with the lightest touch. A true gem.Adding in the effective placement of the two thumb buttons, this mouse has remarkable use as a general utility mouse while still maintaining just enough flexibility to conquer gaming with ease.That isn't to say it has no flaws.As it is several years old now, the software to customize and enable other features is no longer supported (or even easily obtainable). One of the pivotal attractions of gaming mice is such customization and lighting options, of which one must now look for external solutions. It, for example, does have LED lighting modes... but the only mode directly usable out of the box is a slow RGB glow that cycles through the spectrum. No 'team colors' or 'flashing rave' options here. You can't even adjust the brightness without the software and external programs are required to re-assigning the extra buttons or adding macros.Overall, an absolutely wonderful mouse, but without its software support, that's all it is: a wonderful mouse rather than a phenomenal piece of computer engineering.",
          "first of let me start by saying I have several mice that I use for gaming and had got this one for work use. being an old school soul I tend to stay with wired over bluetooth, but for less than 30 bucks I had to try this mouse. I have a SS rival 5 and a Logi G502, (both almost 100 dollars each) and now I don\u2019t use either one of them for gaming.",
          "TL;DR: Button placements / sizes make it somewhat awkward to use if you have bigger hands. Also SteelSeries GG software requirement.Got this to replace my sixteen year old MX518 that finally suffered the dreaded double click problem. I spent days going over reviews, and review, and reviews of so many different mice, all with their own glaring flaws and problems. Even 200+$ mice. This one isn't better, but it isn't terrible. A couple of notes to keep in mind about this if you're on the fence on it, since some folks may not have mentioned:1.) This mouse REQUIRES SteelSeries GG to function beyond anything aside from basic functions (this also includes the dpi button on top being useless as a result, unlike my MX518 from 2005. Funny, ain't it?). It'll say on the box SteelSeries Engine, but that's now bundled into GG. This requires an account with them. A little mean-spirited and prying but sure, whatever. The Engine software itself has a bunch of options, many of which I'll never use outside of the default 5 DPI's. The amount of customization is nice to be presented with at the very least for those that want it.2.) The left / right click buttons on this are big. I mean BIG. I mean I keep accidentally right clicking with my ring finger because they're so big, and my hands are on the larger side of things. If you want to use this thing proper, you're gonna have to learn how to hold it. No matter what way you hold this thing though, you'll never be hitting the silver thumb button unless you hold the mouse itself at a particular angle. It's weird.3.) The black thumb buttons are.... A thing. I assumed the big long one would be pressable inward. I was mistaken. This is a button that you tilt up or down with your thumb with. I don't use it for this reason. The other two smaller ones under it are also a bit difficult to press as a result of said long button.Anyhow, it's good.... Enough. Good enough shouldn't really be the bar for mice and keyboards nowadays but here we are. If you're mouse hunting, you're not gonna find the end all / be all end game mouse in this day and age. It does not exist and if someone tells you otherwise, they're trying to sell you something. 5/10",
          "It\u2019s a nice mouse, but sometimes it will randomly disconnect and I have to turn it off and on again.",
          "Be sure to go to the manufacturer's web site and download the drivers and utility for the mouse, otherwise you won't be able to control the speed settings, button functionality or RGB light show. The utility is a little confusing, but you can customize so much on this mouse, that it's critical to figure it out. I got this mouse as renewed and it seems brand new. I'm very glad I bought it.",
          "I use this mouse for gaming and work and it is the best budget mouse for its durability. the dpi switch did fall inside but it doesn't rattle and works fine for what i use it for.",
          "The mouse comes in a small, and secure package.Through steel series' universal gear hub \"Steel Series GG\" you can program as many DPI levels as you like, I prefer to just have a single level so I don't have to worry about accidently hitting the level switch button.After spending a few years with a different mouse I was pleasantly surprised by how fast I was able to achieve similar and ultimately superior scores on aim labs with this mouse, within the first weekend.The mouse has a simple professional design, that can be livened up with it's programmable RGB lighting.There are also additional options in the Steel series GG software which allow you to tune your mouse to your preference, Allowing you to tune Mouse acceleration, Deceleration, as well as \"Angle snapping\" Which seems to be an onboard system meant to make Flicking more consistent, I didn't like either feature, and was most pleased with all software assists disabled, however I can see that these features would give an edge in competitive gaming.The tracking sensor is consistent, and pretty forgiving when it comes to tracking surface, While I was initially disappointed by how poorly it was working on my battered old mouse pad, I was then abruptly impressed by how easily it could track on random every day objects, and ultimately once I'd replaced my mouse pad, was working very well.This mouse polls up to 1000 Hz, meaning there is 1 millisecond latency, It seems strange to me that there is the option to tune it down to as low as 125 Hz, which would be 8 milliseconds of latency, especially since it's a cabled mouse, that has no need to save battery, but at 1000 Hz, this mouse wins gun fights.",
          "When I got this mouse it was a bit buggy and slow. It took downloading the steelseries software and a firmware update on it for it to work properly. So not a great out of the box experience, but I do like pretty much everything else about the mouse except the scroll wheel and dpi changes. The scroll wheel feels too stiff at times, depends on the game. And the dpi button has no real indication what dpi settings you are on, there may be a setting I missed for that tbh.",
          "Great soft-touch plastic. Mouse is very comfortable in hand. There are no unnecessary elements. Recommend as a basic gaming mouse for shooters.",
          "I got this mouse as a replacement for my old mouse I'd been using for 5+ years. I was a bit worried about the adjustment to it, but it was easy to get used to.The mouse came packaged securely, and without damage. The overall quality of the mouse is great for the pricepoint. The cord is thick and woven, which is always a nice feature. The mouse fits an average-sized hand well, and makes any kind of gaming or web-browsing a breeze. It was a little slippery at the start, but with a few days of use became an issue of the past. The RGB lighting on the mouse is high-quality, and easily adjustable with the SteelSeries PC app.I would highly recommend this SteelSeries mouse for gaming or any PC use!",
          "as described.. mouse is comfortable to hand..",
          "Didn\u2019t realize how tiny this mouse was. Wish it was bigger.",
          "Overall this is a nice budget mouse. It is solidly built, has nice weight and is a bit on the larger side. That's a huge plus, as many cheaper mice are much smaller than their listings suggest. It feels good in the hand and works well off a mouse pad for my general office work (no gaming usage to rate). Having the choice of using either the little USB-A adapter or Bluetooth is a nice feature.The only real issue when compared to many other wireless mice is this one requires a click to wake up. This is surely designed to save battery life and may not be a big deal for some people. After years of using wireless mice that just need a little movement to wake up it is annoying to the point I'll likely gift this one to a family member and return to another brand.",
          "Despite 3 different zones of RGB lighting, there is no way for these lights to change based on what CPI setting. One can configure the CPI button to change into various settings for CPI, but there is no way to map that CPI onto a color change so you can see what setting the mouse is in.Even my simple little cooler master mouse had a light on the CPI button.",
          "It probably could just be an issue with mine so I do not know if the issue is with every mouse, but I opened it up and started to play a basic shooter game with it, but something felt off when I hit the right click, upon further inspection I could feel the right click on my mouse doesn't go down as smooth as the left click, also the middle mouse button was just extremely hard to press, but after repeating the middle mouse click for a few minutes, I think I got it working fine, but the right click of the mouse is very bothersome, and might be a deal breaker for others, other than that the mouse works great, it has an adapter you can plug into a USB port, and it also has support for bluetooth pairing for tables or phones, would be a 5 star product if I wasn't having issues with the right click on the mouse right out of the box. Also it automatically turns off after being idle for like 5 minutes.",
          "Me encant\u00f3 el mouse, sencillamente es muy c\u00f3modo y se apaga solo para ahorra bater\u00eda, luego de esta experiencia no vuelvo a comprar mouse al\u00e1mbricos",
          "I got 15 months out of this mouse before the left-click plastic broke. Instead of replacing it, I decided to try out a low-cost wireless/wired gaming mouse.Pros:Low costWirelessSoftware to change mouse settings is really useful (Including customizing to use less battery-intensive settings)Cons:Batteries are annoying to change no matter how frequent",
          "I\u2019ve had it for two months and it is already having been having some issues because it sometimes like it just likes to spike around at times",
          "Quick reacting, and pretty as well as generally comfortable. Only thing I dislike is the inability to turn off the lights if the mouse is receiving power.",
          "I've bought this mouse 3 years ago and still have no issues, it has almost to lag and works as great as a wited mouse but with all the mobility and extra comfort. I've bought 2 more of these exact mouse for relatives just because its both work friendly and game friendly yet very affordable. I personally use it for gaming and take full advantage of the additonal thumb buttons as they are so accessible and convenient. I definitely recommend it",
          "I really wanted to love this mouse. It has all the features I was looking for, and the build quality is pretty darn good without being to heavy.Alas, the shape just doesn't work for me.Based on my ability to use most mice, I'm guessing I have pretty average size hands, but it is actually uncomfortable for me to try to use the thumb buttons on this mouse. If my hand is far enough forward to reach the front thumb button, I have to twist my hand to reach the rear one. And the top thumb button is just...weird...you trigger it by sliding it up or down (and in theory each direction can be a different mapping) but I would much prefer to have a mouse wheel rocker over that because this button is also difficult to use. Trying to slide that button up it is too easy to trigger one of the other side buttons, and to slide it down requires some hand acrobatics.All that to say, this mouse is a really nice piece of hardware, if they would just do some work on the ergonomics. And the mouse software that comes with it is actually really good. I genuinely want SteelSeries to make a mouse that works for my hand because I love their software. This one isn't it, though.",
          "This is a very nice and comfortable mouse. The battery lasts a long time. I really like.",
          "1. Battery life too short, in wireless mode (didn't test in Bluetooth mode) no matter how heavily you use it. It needs battery change every 1 week or less.2. Scrolling wheel becomes erratic, it's a common issue of mouse, but I mean it happened too soon. (Easy fix by disassembling and cleaning the scrolling wheel part. Found a short hair there impacting the wheel, so this might be my own specific issue.)",

          "This is a great mouse, but i personally believe that its predecessor (the Rival 600) is a better quality mouse. the Rival 5 feels like its made out of cheaper plastic, the cord feels cheaper and is permanently attached. the Rival 600 has a sort of soft-touch coating that doesn\u2019t feel like plain cheap plastic, it has nice rubber grips, the aesthetics are nicer, they offer different weight settings, the cord is detachable, the packaging is nicer, it just really overall feels like a more premium mouse and seems more well thought out and manufactured. with that being said, i think the shape of the rival 5 is slightly nicer, and i like the addition of the toggle buttons on the side, but other than that it simply feels cheaper and seems like it should be the predecessor instead of the successor. i personally decided to stick with the rival 5 because it fits within my hand better with how my pc is setup. and it is very similar to the rival 600, i don\u2019t mean for this review to sound like the rival 5 is a bad mouse or is poor quality by any means because it\u2019s definitely a really really good product and ultimately you can\u2019t go wrong either way, but i do think that overall the rival 600 is a NICER mouse for the money.",

          "I like every feature and the overall design of this mouse, however, when it goes to sleep or power saving mode, it is frustrating to keep clicking and moving the mouse around to eventually see the mouse pointer moving. It really takes longer than it should to quit the sleep mode.",
          "Amazon asked me about battery life. This is not applicable. This is a usb wired mouse with no wireless/battery capabilities.Pros:-The range of dpi customization is helpful, and the ability to instantly switch between two presets (via the tiny button on top behind the scroll wheel) was a welcome surprise-Scroll wheel makes precise and easy to count jumps instead of rolling smoothly, which is good for gaming-rgb is highly customizable-base glides smoothly even without a deskpad-$30 price is fair. I got an open box unit for $15 and felt like I stole it. Price/performance is the best I could find.Con:-Nearly every single time I turn on my gaming computer (once every 2-3 days) there is a new 'critical firmware update.' Only takes a minute but is annoying that SteelSeries can't get it together in this department. I've never had to update a mouse before, and certainly not multiple times a week. One star off for this.",

          "I wish I would of bought this mouse a looong time ago and even paid 30 bucks and now just18 bucks feels like I'm steeling it...HAAAA!!! The quick story is - by far my favorite mouse I've ever used!Detailed story -- I'm way older now and lost count of how many mouses I bought over the years, put it this way, I started playing Diablo when it first came out. So that gives you an idea of how many mouses I've been through, mostly stuck with logitech, but many other off brands too, and was always eyeballing the steelseries, and almost bought one last round but then I found some crazy cheap deal and decided to go with it, Boy am I kicking myself in the behind now, and thank you for the price drop, because this mouse feels like it was custom made for me. Keep in mind I'm average size person 6ft 190ibs average size hands I guess we can say, and as you can see in the pic it's my perfect hand size....perfecttttoooo! And I know I'm in a treehouse and using it on a barstool, but I've had a 100 mouses and none fit this perfect, feel so solid, with buttons that quietly give a perfect push and feedback, I've played with my buddies that pay crazy prices that I would never consider paying just to save a few grams....and I still like this one way better! All I can say is sorry steelseries, I wish I went with ya sooner, but we're connected now and I'll be a loyal fan. OHHH wait wait wait, I was so excited about that perfect fit, how could I forget to mention how freaking cool this lil light show is at night up in the tree-house, there again not overkill just perfect cool looking display! Thanks much steelseries for so much excitement in a mouse...HAAAA! CHEERS MATES!!!PS: YES, I would recommend this mouse! )",

On my left I have the Sensei 10, which I recently upgraded from their Diablo III mouse and this one I upgraded from a very old Razer Diamondback, both of which were showing their age.My only dislike is there isn't a feature in the software to sync illumination schemes to other Steelseries devices but it's not really a big deal. I've tried other gaming mice from other companies and Steelseries is now my goto brand for all gaming schtuff.",
          "I purchased this because it seemed like an affordable option that would do the trick when my razer viper V2 mouse failed on me. I have so far not regretted switching to steelseries and going with a wired option over wireless. My only concern is the scroll wheel. Is it supposed to be so loose when scrolling, perhaps I'm just used to the razer mice having a tighter scroll wheel and every company makes their products differently.",
          "Very good mouse for the price would recommend",

          "The mouse itself feels really well to hold and for gaming runs super smooth. I bought it because it claimed it had a very good battery life however I find myself having to change batteries once a month. Feels a bit like false advertisement claiming so much battery life. Despite this flaw this mouse is still incredible. I purchased rechargeable batteries as a band-aid fix which again is unfortunate.",
          "This is my second one, loved my first.  Honestly my favorite mouse, I\u2019ve tried plenty of others but steelseries takes the cake.Uses two AAA batteries so no worries about dying mid game, just swap and keep it rollin.",
          "I didn\u2019t buy this mouse to game; I wanted a mouse that was overkill for work. That said, I\u2019d be hard-pressed to imagine this key flaw helps in gaming - it is very quick to timeout, and requires multiple clicks to come alive again. If you\u2019re stopping and starting work, this gets very frustrating very quickly.This could potentially be something that can be changed in the mouse\u2019s settings, but the \u201cGG/Engine\u201d software Steelseries provides in not currently compatible with Mac.

It's loud enough to hear through closed back headphones. The right side is also creaky, though quieter. Contacted Steel Series for support/RMA, no reply yet. I found a couple other videos online of people with similar issues with their mice.The RGB is nice, and the associated software is actually good with a nice UI, unlike competitors such as Logitech. It fits my medium to large hand well with either a palm or fingertip grip, and it definitely takes less effort to use than my usual mice.

I wear small to medium examination gloves depending on the procedure (trying to give an example of my hand size). It makes me bend my wrist to the left to compensate for the large palm base.

The extra buttons are nice to setup macros for excel and basic functions like copy/paste/backspace.The mouse doesn't feel like a $100 mouse. It feels like standard plastic and the led \"diffuser\" is definitely a old milk jug. The cut out design is gross and dangerous if you're not careful with liquids.Pretty disappointing in this purchase, ended up returning for something with better battery life, better design and better software options. You can't set each dpi setting to a different color which seems like something that you should be able to do. The only thing good about this mouse was the extra button placements.",

On the thought of the side buttons I mentioned in my headline that the mouse is unique. Now what makes it unique? The um... Flipper(???) side button! Just above the two standard side buttons is a single button or switch that you can flick up or down for separate actions!

There's hundreds of people trying to troubleshoot wireless issues to no avail online over the last year with the Aerox line of mice. I can't believe they're still pumping these out with such QC issues and poor reliability. Way to rip off your customers, Steelseries. First and last ever purchase from you.",

There is no way to fix it, and Amazon would not RMA within the 30 day period. Steelseries would not RMA because Amazon would not RMA, so I'm stuck with a faulty expensive mouse for the next few years.Buyer beware, consider Razer this time around.

          "This mouse ticks all the boxes, but there are few problems with it that made me ultimately return the mouse. First, the right mouse click has a weird groove in it that makes me unable to palm grip the mouse without feeling the right click on my ring finger when playing games. Second, the coating of the mouse felt a little cheap and was very slippery during gaming (hands sweat a lot and it would just not grip correctly).All in all a good mouse for those who can make it work but not for me, if you do like palm grip mice I would recommend looking for alternative options (Xlite V2, DeathAdder V3 Pro, EC2, etc).",

So I decided to upgrade to the wireless version. It's basically exactly the same except for the mesh pattern. I don't mind the mesh pattern on the body of the mouse, but on button 1 and button 2, it's just downright stupid. I hate how it feels. Takes this from a 5 all day to a disappointing 3 stars.",

It is light but doesn't feel cheap. The main buttons feel decent and the scroll wheel clicks and feel good. The side buttons are ok, a bit close together for thumb use , but functional with a bit of wobble as well as pre and post travel. The glides are average like what you would expect to get with any mouse in the price range. I traded them out for some glass glides from Pulsar and use it on a fnatic XL desk mat.The sensor is good although sometimes the the input lag doesn't always catch some of the rapid clicking when you already have one of the main buttons pressed, I brought this up in an email to there support a month ago but have no heard anything back. I wish the tracking was a little faster and smoother but understand that the firmware for the price point can only do so much.",

Unfortunately in your mouse1 and mouse2 buttons if you press lower on the button where the honeycomb/webbing/holes are it can't take the stress and will break over time. They should have made the entire mouse1 (left) and mouse2 (right) buttons solid plastic and this wouldn't be an issue.This won't impact some people who don't press down in the middle of the button but be aware.",

It lasts probably around 16 hours at most with the RGB on. But it charges fast so it\u2019s not too much of an issue-the build quality feels like a VERY cheap plastic. It\u2019s like pressing on a flimsy plastic basket. The price just can\u2019t justify the cheapness of the plastic, otherwise this would be 5 stars",
          "Update: After using the mouse continually for a few days, I've been able to adjust some to the honey comb on the clicking surfaces (without using tape). Adding one star as I've enjoyed the mouse more since the initial review, but still not a sound design decision for future models.---- original review ---I just received both the Aerox 5 and 9 for prime day with the intent of playing high APM games like StarCraft II. Unfortunately right off the bat I can tell they may have to be returned, as the honey comb extends too far into the mouse buttons to the point that it digs into your fingers when clicking frequently. I don't know if my hands are just too small (I think they are average medium size) or that I use more than just the tip of my fingers to click, but as an ergonomic mouse the entire button click surfaces should *always* be completely solid and comfortable. (I understand the goal to save weight, but the extra 1g is definitely not worth it.)For now I have taped over the portion of the honey comb on the left/right click buttons, which is pretty janky to have to do at this price point. Nonetheless the rest of the mouse is nice as you'd expect; I'll be seeing if I can live with the tape, else they'll be returned.",
          "When I compared this mouse to my previous mouse I was surprised with how light weight it is! The mouse comes with a premium USB-A to USB-C cable to keep it powered. My hands can now be at rest from weightlifting my previous mouse!",
          "I've been looking for a general mouse to replace my old HyperX Pulsefire. This mouse is great (can be wired, wireless or bluetooth) so I can connect it to a few computers. It has 3 stars because:1. It is really fragile, especially the side button that clicks up and down. That button popped out of place on an unfortunate tumble off the ergo mouse tray and stayed on a click down position. Luckily you can ignore that button in the Steelseries GG software2. It is very hard to take the mouse apart. It doesn't pop out like other mice when you remove the bottom screws. It looks like just the entire bottom plate comes off but it is the bottom plate + the right side of the mouse together. If you try to pop the bottom plate off by itself, you'll break 2 really thin pieces of plastic held by small screws that you can't really see. Since the mouse is lightweight, Steelseries opted for very thin plastic that will snap if you bend it a tad too far. 18 screws later and 4 broken retention clips, I was able to redo the side button and put the mouse back mostly together. It still works. Some of the screws are hidden behind other plastics and the bottom mouse PCB so you'll need a very thin Philips screwdriver for that.",
          "If you can afford it definitely a must buy",
          "The mouse was good while it worked after 2 weeks it started not to track properly and started stuttering.",
          "Es un mouse excelente para los juego que prefiero (fps de supervivencia, t\u00e1cticos y mmo rpg).Es muy ligero, la bater\u00eda d\u00eda unos 3 d\u00edas aproximadamente ( 8 horas por d\u00eda), a m\u00ed parecer la carga de la bater\u00eda es r\u00e1pida. Lo malo es que las luces consumen mucha bater\u00eda.El software es un poco complicado pero tiene bastantes opciones y funciona bien.La construcci\u00f3n del mouse de siente un poco fr\u00e1gil, pero no me ha dado problemas. El bot\u00f3n que est\u00e1 frente al pulgar es un poco inc\u00f3modo de usar, pero eso evita que lo presiones sino querer. Es un mouse para una mano de 17cm o mayor.",
          "I come from using a much heavier mouse so switching to this ultra light-weight mouse is taking some getting used to. Tinkering with the engine settings in the GG app is a must to get your CPI settings right.I really like the button placement, though the 7-8 can be a bit awkward since they are up and down rather than push in. The 9 button is placed a little further out so it prevents accidental presses which was a major problem with my previous mouse. I *highly* recommend using a mouse bungee to keep your cord off the desk because of the weight of the mouse. Otherwise the tiniest bit of drag from the cord can affect your aim or move the mouse.As far as keeping it clean, I use a can of compressed air to blow it out every couple of days because my place is a dust factory. I wear compression gloves so getting oils on the open parts of the mouse aren't an issue, and a simple wipe of the buttons with an alcohol prep pad takes care of the buttons.In terms of playing games until you dial in those CPI settings you may have some issues with your aim, especially if you are doing fast-twitch things like FPS. However being able to create profiles for programs is very useful, even if you have to actually know where your program is located to select the executable file to make one. It does switch seamlessly when you click in and out of programs so there's a definite plus. Unfortunately there aren't any built-in integrations with programs like Discord so you'll have to rely on setting up keys with program hotkeys.The RGB settings aren't the most advanced and a bit difficult to set up in comparison to other devices I've used. If that's super important to you you may not be happy with this, but for me personally I'm not bothered.In summary, it's a good mouse, and if you can pick it up on sale like I did it's well worth it. Keep in mind this is a really light mouse and there will be an adjustment period if you're coming from something heavy. Setting it up with the software takes a bit more know-how than other programs for other brands.",
          "The hardware is great. Breathable, obviously, fits my large-ish hands rather well, and I can press all the buttons I need to, when I need to.Software for it kinda sucks. Macro timings are garbage, convoluted UI, and hardly does anything over standard without it.This is a love child between an FPS and MMO mouse: Just enough buttons for more unique input games while being light, fast and controllable for simpler, reaction based games. Unless you're the type of person who wants to use one mouse for one genre of game, this is probably decent for you.",

          "I am an avid player of First Person Shooter games (FPS) and as such I demand a low weight, high precision input device.  The Aerox 5 fits the bill for me.  I am coming from a pedigree of Basic Packard Bell (1990s) -> Microsoft Explorer -> Razer Deathadder -> G502 -> Glorious Model D Wireless -> Aerox 5.While I really enjoyed the Glorious Model D, I immediately missed the extra buttons from my G502.  I adjusted to the reduction in mouse buttons by grabbing a foot pedal for PTT voice comms (similar pedal: https://amzn.to/3VwdEuD) which turned out to be an amazing upgrade.The Model D only lasted a few months before the scroll wheel malfunctioned.  The wheel would randomly scroll causing me to weapon switch during intense left-click firefights. The right click mouse button also started sticking.So, looking for an upgrade, I stumbled upon the Aerox 5.The things that immediately drew me to the Aerox 5 were the 9 programmable buttons. I love that the mouse is an ultra light, weighing only slightly more than the Model D I was upgrading from. The mouse is pretty much perfect in every way, however there are a couple of annoying things I will point out here:1. The dongle is USB-C.  I do not have a USB-C port in my PC, so I was running the dongle with a long USB-A -> USB-C connection... until I stumbled upon the direct plug adapter (2nd pic).  You can get one of those here https://amzn.to/3GmkoH6.  I wish they had included one with the mouse.2. The mouse profiles in the SteelSeries GG software don't reliably automatically switch.  I have different profiles set up for each of my games with different button bindings and while the profile normally switches just fine, it's not 100% reliable.  Easy to fix.  I would recommend just having the 1 default profile and setting the extra mouse buttons to the NUMPAD keys and then change your key bindings in game accordingly. That way you don't have to mess with profile switching.  That's how I'll be setting it up once I reformat and lose these profiles.3. There is no DPI indicator light on the mouse that I can tell.4. The battery life is not the greatest but more than adequate.  It'll last 2 or 3 days before needing a charge.  I normally just connect it back up when I'm done playing and never really notice it.All in all, a great mouse and I highly recommend it.

          "I needed a gaming mouse with a few more buttons, without going overboard  with a full MMO setup.  This mouse is a nice compromise.  It is extremely light and glides smoothly against any surface.  The buttons are large and comfortable to access.  The shape of the mouse closely resembles Razer Deathader, thus it is very comfortable, and I do like the thumb wedge.  I use the the flick switch as left /right  /strafe in 3D games, which allows me to comfortably play without using the keyboard at all.  I am however worried that given the amount of pressure  applied on the flick switch that it wont last long.  Time will tell.My only problem with this mouse is the non existent  Linux support.  Which requires me to use third party hacks to be able to access the button and RGB  lighting profiles.  However the mouse does have onboard memory and so I am able to reuse my button profile across multiple operating systems.  A custom RGB lighting scheme  still requires background software to run, which I really do not like.One thing that can be easily improved about this mouse is having a  reinforced plastic for the thumb wedge, otherwise the mouse tends to squeak when ever I try put my thumb against it.",
          "Can't complain about the weight even if it's not the absolute lowest weight wireless mouse on the planet.  Personally I find the shape to be decent, however I think the peak of it could have been further back and maybe not as tall, that said it's a shape that didn't take long to get used to.  Tracking seems solid, and thankfully although you can have 5 CPI options, you can also remove them to allow only as many as you prefer.  The cable is solid, feels nice and loose and certainly leagues better than my old Rival 310's cord.The complaints, not huge but there's a number of things that could be improved upon.  The lighting is good, but you have to be in 2.4GHz for any customization to work which 2.4GHz eats through the battery so much faster and for the life of the battery I feel it should be reserved for gaming.  On the note of wireless, I don't think it would have hurt for them to build bluetooth into the USB dongle.  As a desktop gamer wired is king for networking and I had to rummage through my motherboard box for the wireless antenna to get any reasonable bluetooth signal.The buttons and scroll wheel feel solid, however the forward silver side button requires too much adjustment to reach, though you won't accidentally hit it.  The extra up/down toggle button is just awkward to hit and because of how much it protrudes, it distracts from the thin back and forward buttons which have taken some time to get used to...at first I struggled to even recognize the back button by touch.",
          "Feels incredibly smooth, especially when it\u2019s an upgrade from a cheap one, love the customization of the buttons, the color, and the amount of dpi switches you can have. I\u2019ve used the mouse both ergonomic and gaming.",
          "I love this company- the other products of theirs I have are just top tier. This mouse also seems well made and is exceptionally light, and the design seems great for keeping your hands from getting sweaty. BUT the forward thumb button is not a DPI clutch. It looks like one. It\u2019s where one should be. But it is not a DPI clutch, and there is no setting to make it one. This isn\u2019t a huge deal if you aren\u2019t used to playing with a DPI clutch, but if you are used to it and expecting it, this product is a disappointment. For a company that otherwise makes top tier gaming mice, it seems like a weird detail to overlook, and honestly, it might be an easy fix on the software side to just add DPI clutch as an optional functionality. It\u2019s on me for not reading up more on the mouse before I bought it, but again, I have come to expect cutting edge from this company, so that lack of functionality was just something I expected\u2026 especially because the button is right there! I really hope this is a feature they add later, because I want to give this thing an honest try. Please add DPI clutch functionality to what could definitely be a top-tier peripheral!",
          "Features on this mouse sounded amazing, however, after purchasing and using it for a couple days, I have found that it is constantly stuttering. I expected this to some extent with the wireless modes but it even does it in wired mode!",
          "The hardware and form factor are fine enough.But oof, the software!The \u201cSteelSeries GG\u201d setup software is master software that apparently services and hawks all the different types of SS peripherals - mice, keyboards, headsets, speakers - and also peripheral apps that also get installed with the GG software.If you look hard enough you can find in that mish-mash the tabs to click to access your mouse setup facility.The GG software install wants you to set up an account with SteelSeries in order to complete the install.  If you are careful, you can install without making an account, but it is suggested that you will have diminished functionality.The GG software install defaults to always starting on system bootup.  This switch, if you can find it, can be turned off, but there will be a scary message that you will be missing out on functionality.An account with SS and always on software, especially for just a mouse, well. that smells like data mining.  And the terms and conditions bear that out.I am used to sometimes opaque mouse setup software with other brands, but the GG software takes the cake.  I fell into a deep time sink when I discovered that the custom profile color setups that I had created for my mouse (Basic Desktop and Gaming) worked no more and only the default color scheme was operational.After much sturm and drang, I finally figured out that in the \u201cPrism\u201d color facility within GG if you simply click the box acknowledging the existence of your particular mouse, as one will do, that it then overrides whatever configuration color setups you created in the \u201cGear\u201d setup facility and only the default setup can be used.  Evidently, there are two color setup facilities within GG, and they do not cooperate.",

          "After a couple months with the Aerox 5 Wireless, I'm mostly disappointed. The good is that it's definitely lightweight compared to other mice I've used..... The bad though is how often it drops connection in 2.4 mode. Sometimes takes 30 sec to 1 min to finally get moving again, and it happens way more often then I would like.",

        "name": "SteelSeries Rival 600 Gaming Mouse - 12,000 CPI TrueMove3Plus Dual Optical Sensor - 0.5 Lift-off Distance - Weight System - RGB Lighting",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "reviews": [
          "I purchased the Rival 600 a few days ago, I've had it for a couple of days now and wow. I am using this mouse to play Overwatch, CSGO and Battle Field One -- My in game accuracy has in-fact improved, (from 45% hit average to 52%) is an understatement. The tracking is smooth and accurate and the lift off distance sensor works great for me because I don't have the desk space needed to play so I often have to lift my mouse to reposition.I specifically bought this mouse because I have been using the Razer Naga for years now for all my gaming needs. Lately, I've been really into OW and playing Widow and McCree often -- in most matches I did fine but when I faced other GOOD Widows I noticed I'd get beat to a shot by mere milliseconds and my ping is fairly low (30ms on average) and play on a 144hz monitor. I was beginning to think my reflexes just weren't good enough.. Then a friend of mine suggested I get a mouse for FPS games -- (like wth is the difference is what I thought) he teased me about using a MOBA mouse for FPS -- long story short I figured I'd give it a shot. I looked at a ton of reviews on gaming mice and the Rival 600 caught my attention, so I bought. It is worth every cent -- it just feels much more accurate. To be fair if you suck at FPS it won't make you good via magic but it can help you improve a bit if you know what you are doing already, that is MY OPINION.The only issues I've had with the mouse is that the lift off sensor is TOO sensitive. After calibrating the mouse to my pad, I simply set the liftoff sensor  to the lowest lift distance possible -- and low behold there are dips and bumps on my pad that I hadn't even noticed before. When the sensor would hit these dips and bumps the mouse would stop responding. At first I thought the mouse was defective and was about to return it but after reading thru a few forum posts on this issue I simply increased the lift off distance a bit and the problem went way.***EDIT***This is the the third product every I buy from SteelSeries, the first product was a wired USB headset that sounded prettty decent, was cheap and broke within a few weeks. I tossed that and carried on. However, recently I found a review for their Artic PRO + DAC headset -- I was sold by the aluminum design (as my previous headset was plastic and broke really easily). Plus I am a bit of an audiophile, meaning I can appreciate good sound equipment (like I hate hate sound bars) and this headset is one of the first HIFI certified \"gaming\" headset. So I bought it.. and feel in love with it -- it was a bit pricey but I am enjoying it. And now the Rival 600 is my new favorite mouse for FPS (I still like the NAGA for FFXIV).SteelSeries is on a roll with me atm with their products, if only they made a competitor to the Razer Tartarus.. I'd buy that in a heart beat -- I recently purchased the Razer Tartarus v2 (I own two others) and it's so buggy and their software sucks -- problem is very few companies make these keypads and most of them are terrible. So SteelSeries make one.. please :P",
          "I\u2019ve used every brand out there; Razer, Corsair, HyperX, Roccat, Logitech\u2026 and so far this is the greatest mouse I\u2019ve ever used. I am absolutely obsessed by it, which is weird but you won\u2019t understand until you\u2019ve used a ton of other mouses and then this one.The price, feel, and response on this mouse is unlike any other! Just get it, you won\u2019t regret it.",
          "Coming from the g403, I didn't think I would be able to find a better mouse. Even though i liked the light weight of the g403 the hump would dig into my hand during games and I would get a lot of hand pain during rts games like Age of Empires 3. The Rival 600 is amazingly comfortable, sensor is accurate, and still weighs in at under 100 grams which allows for rapid movement in shooters.This is by far the most comfortable mouse I've ever used. Unlike some of the other steelseries mice, this actually fits nicely, especially if you have a medium to large hand. It's ergonomic but with subtle curves, which allow for a comfortable gaming experience in every type of game I've played: rpg, rts, and even shooters. There are also rubber side grips on the side which help maintain control of mouse during fast gameplay.If I had to point out a couple of cons with the rival 600 it would be the dpi button and the somewhat spongy left clicker. The dpi button sits slightly behind the scroll wheel but is raised up to where an accidental dpi change is possible when trying to scroll click. This may be a non-issue if you decide to disable the button in the steelseries engine software. The left clicker feels like it travels slightly too much. Seems to be a problem with steelseries mice in general. This however has not affected my gameplay.It does have weights supplied with the mouse, although i don't see the purpose considering this mouse is already 96grams without them. If you decide you want the the sides can be pulled off (they have strong magnets so no movement on side panels during gameplay) and the weights fit in slots inside of the side panels. Another feature is the removable micro usb cord that can be swapped out depending on your preference.",
          "This mouse is an overpriced gimmick, and the Rival 300 is a better mouse for less money.1. The Rival 600 has a slippery finish and is awkward to lift due to the right side being tapered outward at the bottom. In contrast, the Rival 300 tapers inward on the bottom and is much easier to grip2. Due to the mouse being difficult to grip, you won't want to add any weights to the Rival 600, making the customizable-weight feature pointless3. The \"lift-off\" sensor only comes into play if you rock the mouse backward, lifting the front of the mouse off of the pad while keeping the rear edge against the pad. Nobody moves their mouse like that. In normal usage, lift-off behavior is identical to the Rival 300.4. Overall accuracy is identical to the Rival 300.5. The Rival 300 has a smooth, round shape and more comfortable to hold. The 600 has large and uncomfortable gaps where the main buttons meet the side and rear of the mouse, as well as over the LED racing stripes. Additionally, the 300 holds the weight of your hand better due to the pronounced hump at the rear third of the mouse. The 300 has a much smaller hump, which means most of the weight of your hand will be focused where your palm rests against the mouse pad. Over a few hours of use, this leads to uncomfortable friction against the mouse padOverall, the Rival 600 is a waste of money for a mouse that is less comfortable to use than the cheaper Rival 300. Don't bother with this mouse.",
          "Very comfortable mouse with seemingly solid build quality, however after two years of work and gaming use the scroll wheel has begun to not register or misregister inputs, which makes 3d modelling and gaming very difficult. I'd hoped for better for the price.I disassembled the mouse and blew out the mechanism, which helped a little for a couple days, but was back to its old antics fairly quickly.",
          "Quick Bullets for those who do not have the time to read a page of review.PROS:- The mouse is amazing. The lift sensor works, the two settings of sensitivity work great for us who work on two different computers now we are WFH, it's comfortable and responsive. Honestly, I have not wanted a new mouse until...CONS:- The rubber pads on the side of the mouse are not attached well. I admittedly use my computer a lot, but it feels like an oversight when the failure mode of the mouse is adhesive for an auxiliary component like a grip pad. - This is extra annoying because it's the pad that my ring finger sits on when I am using the mouse... More often than not I will grab some loose adhesive and stick to the mouse.CONCLUSION:-  The mouse is great, but I wish they used a better adhesive for the pads on the sides. I think super glue will fix it-- so I am not docking many stars.",
          "I've had the Rival 600 since New Year's 2019. The mouse itself is high quality, it is durable (outside of one issue), and the adjustable weights are a unique gimmick that I have not found anywhere else, it works as intended with the steelseries engine along with my Arctis 5 headset and Apex M750 keyboard.There were two flaws that you will see many other reviews discussing on this page. THEY HAVE NOW BEEN FIXED. Steelseries support seems to have improved a lot since early 2018, I have created three tickets and have received a prompt, polite and helpful response every time and I do not think it would be any different as long as you're not acting like a jerk to the guy trying to help you. Two of these mentioned web tickets were for the other flaw mentioned with this mouse - a faulty adhesive on the left side grip caused the rubber to peel off of the grip leaving you with a sticky and uncomfortable surface. This has been fixed as of April 2019 and if you have had this issue in the past customer support seems happy to help.",
          "I'm not saying this mouse is bad, if you like it then great! But I was definitely not satisfied with using this mouse for a long period of time because for the price of this mouse, there was many other options. I used it for a month and a half and the only thing I could say I like about it and separates itself from other mice is it's asthetic and the weight adjustment.Now as a gamer I don't need weight adjustment because for me, the lighter the mouse the more control and freedom I have of my hand movement. The side buttons feel good but the 3rd button is useless for my hand because my thumb is not long enough to reach it nor do I think anyone under 6'1 can. The grip feels good and pretty satisfying. The clicks are harder to press then some mice which is great if you don't want to mis-click but it's not for me. The dual censor is pretty good no complaints there.At the end of the day, there's a lot more mice to choose from that can competewith this one but if this suits your preference than that's good.",
          "This is a fantastic mouse, with issues.The RGB lights are very bright and there are many lighting options on the SteelSeries Engine which is very easy to use. The mouse also tracks very well and has a very small liftoff distance as it advertises, the only problem I've come to realize, which might just be a problem with my mouse, is that putting the liftoff distance as low as possible seems to skip my mouse inputs. This effect is especially bad on hard surface mousepads, it seems.Overall, I have no complaints with the mouse. If I had reviewed this mouse a few months ago, it would have been 5 stars. However, the grips on the side of the mouse are adhered to the mouse with glue. Glue that apparently doesn't stick after countless hours of use, the pads come off and the glue makes your fingers sticky and it's really irritating. I feel like this is only going to get worse, to the point where I'm going to need a new mouse. I wouldn't complain if this happened 2 years or more later and if I had more use of the mouse, but paying $70 for this quality is quite disappointing. So, maybe me saying this is a fantastic mouse might not be true because of this. But I really enjoyed this mouse for the time it didn't have any problems.TLDR: Good mouse tracking, sub-par build quality, great lights, good software",
          "I love this mouse.  However, after a year and a half, the sticky stuff holding the pads on the sides of the mouse have gotten soft and the pads keep sliding off.  I plan on cleaning the goo off and continue using it.",
          "Overall it's an ok mouse, but it's got some major design flaws. The problem is all the rubber grips are adhered with a subpar glue that gets gooey over time. Got the first set replaced under warranty, but now the second set is doing the same. They assured me that they would be different, they are not.",
          "good",
          "Bought this because it had good reviews, and because my Logitech wired mouse had suddenly stopped registering clicks and randomly started double-clicking every other time.So far, no issues with this one. The colors are neat, you can have them customized, though honestly as you generally have the hand covering it, it won't be seen much. Regardless, the size is perfect for my hand size, and even though it only has two buttons, I personally find that to be plenty!",
          "has  3 buttons on left side, more then enough for back n forth during web browsing and they work very well for any game that you need a few easy macros to hit on your mouse, you can program them to whatever you want....unfortunally you have to use their software for that. we all know we love ANOTHER rgb software to VD our systems lol i bought mine refurbished to keep one out of a land fill and it arrived in perfect shape and i love it. still use it. just dont use the software lol itt seems to remember the marcos for the kkeys on the mouse after u edit them in the software once, so you can leave it off after that. so i guess thats better then nothing",
          "Perfect for small handed gamers such as myself since most mice are made for big man hands. I also love a weighted mouse and there aren\u2019t many on the market(and it\u2019s adjustable!!!).Only downside I\u2019ve seen is the silicone grip\u2019s adhesive is crappy. Easily fixed if you use super glue to replace it. Stayed until my last one died and redid the glue on my new one. Simply cosmetic and doesn\u2019t change the function of this mouse!This is my second mouse of this type. Had to get it after my first one died. Would get it again for a 3rd time if it\u2019s still on the market when my next one goes.",
          "When it was in good working order, this has been a wonderful mouse.  Good feel and weight, good responsiveness, really like it.However, similar to other reviews I've seen, the adhesive for the rubber padding on the sides of the mouse (for me both the front right pad as well as the main left pad) started failing after about 18 months of use. Now about 2 years in, it is rather gross. For a relatively high end product, I expected (maybe incorrectly?) to get more than 2 years of regular use out of the mouse.So - mixed review. Was a 5-star for about a year and then fell off.(Rival 600 wired mouse)Edit to add: I also purchased their wireless mouse after I bought this one which was left at the office when the world ended during the pandemic. When I picked it up after it just sitting in a box at work for over a year, it had the exact same issue with the sticky glue leaking and being quite challenging to clean off. This appears to be a systemic problem related to exposure to heat (is my guess), but not extreme heat, just relatively warm normal indoor temperatures. There is a materials issue here with the glue used, in my opinion.",
          "Acctually this mouse is really nice",
          "I am 4 days shy of owning this for a month. My scroll wheel will often not register or mis-register. I'll scroll, and the window will act janky, to the point where I would just rather click and drag down on the scroll bar. I came back here to see if any reviews had the same issues, and sure enough, there are plenty, except most seemed to have had the issue after about 2 years of ownership. A month is not acceptable. The moust is otherwise fantastic, one of my favorite ever, if not for the scrollwheel, but it makes using the mouse a total chore.",
          "Best mouse I have ever owned! I have had it for almost 2 years now and still stands up from day one. I hear the pads on the sides adhesive would wear out but honestly mine has not. If I had and issue I would point out that the third thumb button to the front is a little weird to reach but I never use it that often anyway.",
          "I\u2019ve used a handful of mice in my past and this is the best one yet! It\u2019s a pretty light mouse if you take all of the weights out but if you want an ultralight mouse I\u2019d recommend a pwnage ultralight but if you don\u2019t care for a few grams then this is super customizable with weight and you can change the colors of the mouse with their program and make macros like I did for editing so now I have a macro to auto select and delete clips in premiere pro and photoshop (those programs have built in shortcuts but they kinda suck and are limited and now I can do almost everything with one hand) I like this mouse so much that I had to buy another one because I game and edit with it so much! I recommended it to my brother and he absolutely loves it too! I will continue to use this mouse for a very long time and I would recommend this mouse first to anyone!",
          "EDIT: After approximately 2 months of usage, the mouse is falling apart--literally. Turns out the rubber side panels on the mouse are GLUED ON rather than affixed with any kind of strong material or integrated into the mouse. It's possible to fix these with some super glue or something, but you have to clean out the factory adhesive and try to fit the rubber panels back on, which is a massive pain. For $80, I would expect higher build quality than cheap Chicom glue on rubber panels. Shame. I'm reducing this review to two stars--the mouse industry strikes again!After having used a Logitech G403 for around a year or so, I found myself requiring a new mouse after the scroll wheel went kaput. As it so turns out, that is a VERY common problem with the G403 and the main culprit is the firmware. My relationship with mouse manufacturers and designers is very tumultuous. It seems that no companies create mice that are built to last and efficiently-designed, but generally in my experience Steelseries mice have been some of the least bad (but they're not innocent.)The SensorI had a rival 310 years ago, and it had a deal-breaking flaw, which was an error-prone sensor that would sometimes send my cursor flying up across the screen. That flaw, however, seems to not be present in the Rival 600 much to my relief. The Rival 600 feels accurate, precise, and it's a joy to use. I use around 400 DPI and play a lot of FPS games on low sensitivities (less than a 360) and I'm rather good at them, so having a precise mouse is completely necessary and I am very picky about it. This one meets all my needs, unlike the G403. It felt like a chore to aim with the G403 because it had very strange tracking. It felt granular, and for some reason it would cause diagonal movement when I swiped horizontally. The Rival 600, in contrast, is totally flat when I swipe horizontally and it feels like I have much greater fine control.The ShapeThe Rival 600 is a standard intellimouse-style design, and I consider that to be the ultimate shape for a gaming mouse. It's large enough for a palm grip, but not too big for a claw grip or a hybrid grip. It suits any right-handed user, although left-handed users will find the shape uncomfortable. There are, however, two flaws with the design: 1. The case has various crevices for the LEDs and for aesthetic purposes that give it an unpleasant angular feeling. I'd prefer it didn't have those. 2. There is a small side button in front of and inferior to Mouse 5 that I constantly mistake for Mouse 5. I'll get used to it eventually, but I have no personal use for additional macro buttons or whatever these are. Maybe I'll just map it to Mouse 5 and be done with it, but I think gaming mice tend to have far too many buttons than are necessary. DPI switches and macro buttons are marketing gimmicks and I'm convinced only a few people ever use them, if they even work properly (which, often they don't.)The MicroswitchesFor the most part, this is an excellent mouse; however, it does have one weakness: Mediocre microswitches. The Rival 600's buttons are astonishingly stiff, and they shortly become even more so with only minimal amounts of use. There's nothing wrong with increasing the force threshold for buttons on gaming gear, and in fact I think that's usually a good idea because it mitigates the tendency for users to accidentally press buttons in the middle of stressful situations--that's one reason I exclusively use keyboards with MX Cherry Blue switches and abhor Reds. Still, mice with stiff switches do not feel very good to me. Logitech makes probably the best switches on the market (and it's a shame everything else about their mice reeks.) If only Steelseries could step their switch game up a bit. Another concern I have about the switches is that they feel sort of flimsy. I had a Steelseries Sensei at one point and it fell victim to the dreaded multi-click malfunction, and I hope my Rival 600 does not eventually do the same. Additionally, over time it feels like the switches are losing some tactility and are becoming gradually more mushy, and I hope that doesn't cause any functional problems.The CableThis is one area in which Steelseries is innovating pretty massively. Unlike other mice, the Rival 600 has a detachable USB cable that can be replaced with either additional first-party cables, or aftermarket third-party cables. The cable that comes with the mouse is a standard rubber cable and it works fine; however, if you prefer a braided cable, you may be able to find one online. Plus, one of the first parts to commonly break on a mouse is the cable, which can become frayed over time. I always support replaceable cables because they can dramatically increase the lifespan of hardware without the need to solder one on. It seems to be very securely attached inside the housing, and the cable has henceforth not detached from the socket from normal use.Mouse BloatThe Rival 600, compared to other \"GAMING\" mice, has minimal bloat, although it still has too much in my eyes. Marketing candy does little to improve the function of the mouse, and it can in many cases cause the price to skyrocket. Multicolor LED lights sold using the marketing buzzword \"RGB\" seem to be all the rage nowadays, but frankly I never look at my mouse while I'm doing anything. How do lights improve my user experience? There are also two macro buttons on the mouse that irritate me. Macro buttons are useless to me--I just want a no-frills 5-button mouse that is durable, affordable, and has a good sensor with good software support. The Rival 600, at $79, is far from efficient and affordable, and if Steelseries cut out a lot of junk it could probably be close to $50 or $60. I don't know if I'm alone in this, but I'm tired of this marketing drivel used to justify insane markups, but no companies seem to desire creating and marketing efficient mice. Sad.SummaryThe Rival 600 feels like a good mouse at the moment. The sensor is fantastic, the shape is good, and it functions well, but I don't know how long it will last and the flimsy microswitches worry me a bit. This is speculation, but my experience has led me to believe that gaming mice are all designed with planned obsolescence in mind. They fail either within a few months or within the span of a year after normal use. With that in mind, take this review with a grain of salt because I've had this mouse for less than a month. If circumstances change, I will update this review. If, however, it holds up, I highly recommend purchasing this mouse.",
          "This is my journey as a CSGO player with 19cm by 10.5cm hands.I came from using the Logitech G403 for over a year. I liked everything about the G403, especially the feel of the clicks and its light weight. However, over time, I noticed I kept placing my ring finger slightly on the top right edge of the right button. I was most proficient gripping the mouse in a two-finger fingertip-palm hybrid, but after extended gaming sessions, I often would give my hand relief by placing all three of my fingers on top of the mouse, using my middle finger for the scroll wheel and my ring finger for the right button. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the front of the mouse was too wide for meAs much as I liked G403's technical performance, I decided I needed to find a more comfortable mouse. After a lot of research, I decided to try the Rival 310 specifically because of its narrower front dimensions. Overall, I was probably 95% satisfied with the Rival 310. Given its overall comfort and narrower front end, I noticed I did aim better with it than the G403. However, after a couple of weeks of use, I came to three conclusions. First, although I liked the shape, it was difficult dealing with its drastic variation in dimensions depending on just where each finger rested on the mouse; I had to be thoughtful and careful when holding the mouse in order to feel consistent. Second, I felt like its top buttons were a tad too resistant, leading my fingers to feel sore after a normal night of gaming. Third, its idiosyncratic shape, with the hump further back, felt great for claw or palm grip, but didn't feel as good for my fingertip-palm hybrid compared to mice with the hump in the more conventional center area of the mouse.I hesitated quite a bit with the Rival 600. Its slightly heavier overall weight, RGB ridiculousness, pointless removable cable, needless weight system, and superfluous second sensor for liftoff distance (which Razer and Logitech mice have been able to tune with *gasp* just a single sensor for LITERALLY years, which decades in mouse-years) all turned me off. I probably placed an order and cancelled it 20 times before I finally pulled the trigger.Well, I am very happy I did. Immediately noticeable is that the plastic and silicone both have a silky, premium feel. The feel of the top clicks greatly exceeded my expectations as well; they feel almost equal to that of the G403. Most importantly, the mouse shape is exactly what I was looking for. While the 600 and the 310 are both Rival mice, the 600 is a new revision of the shape. The hump is more forward compared to the 310, and the mouse buttons rest slightly higher and flatter compared to the 310's extreme downward top slope. This all came together to mean a much more comfortable shape for my grip. It really fits my hand like a glove, and I'm very happy with it. With some tuning, lift off distance is better than the 310 but not better or worse than the G403, which one could also tune. The only relative weakness of the 600 compared to the 310 is that the side buttons are smaller and slightly less user friendly.Hope this comparison was helpful!---------------EDIT (3/25/2018): Having tried this out for just under a month, I've decided to exchange it for another mouse. There are three reasons for this:1. I have large hands, and my most comfortable grip position makes my thumb rest on the non-standard furthest mouse button. Yet, I keep wanting to keep my thumb on the smooth silicone part just behind it even though bending my thumb back like that isn't as comfortable. This discomfort, though minor, is present every day, every time I use the mouse.2. The silicone material on both sides and on the primary top mouse buttons feels super premium and smooth. However, I think they also trap more heat. My hands get SUPER SWEATY when gaming with this mouse. The silver lining here is that there appears to never be any grime build-up on this mouse. However, this heat issue is a deal breaker for me.3. The right and left sides of the mouse, due to the silicone, is super smooth, but both sides are tapered upwards, resulting in a slippery, difficult time whenever I try to lift the mouse. I have to pinch it harder than I'd like to, and over a session of gaming, my hands get really tired. This is further is exacerbated by reason 2.I recently had to fix some stuff on my wife's computer, to which I had hooked up my Deathadder more than a year ago. Griping that mouse again felt sublime and reminded me of my 20s gaming with that mouse and, besides the double-click button issue that plagued the first couple generations of Deathadders, I had always felt that Deathadder shape was super comfortable. This is also when I knew the Rival 600 and I weren't working out as I had hoped.My gaming mouse journey enters the next chapter. From Deathadder 3G (button issue) -> whole bunch of mice -> G403 -> Rival 310 -> Rival 600 -> Deathadder Elite.If Steelseries every makes a lighter, more straight forward version of the Rival 600 without the unnecessary third mouse button, removable sides, extra weight system, etc. I'd go to that in a heartbeat.",
          "Alright, so I've had the rival 600 since November of 2018. The first day I got it, It was already loads better than my previous mouse, and it took about a day to basically get to my movement with it. It's really nice shaped and the RGB is pretty cool, but the feel is the real winner here.I'm giving this a 4/5 because the adhesive or glue is actually spreading apart from the rubber grip thats right below the three mouse buttons. I was wondering why I would feel this sticky stuff every one and awhile and I would just wipe down my controller. I looked a bit closer today and the whole rubber grip actually moves when I barely touch the thing, and it's squeezing out little by little. It's pretty loose now, It will probably hold up for awhile if I don't touch it.Overall, It's a great mouse for the price, especially when it's on sale.Edit: Over the past 3 years I've had this mouse, there is only one problem that I had. That damn adhesive glue'd part. I have no idea why you would stick glue right where your thumb is going to be. It's not really a big deal, it's still holding up just fine after 3 years. A slight design flaw if you ask me though, this rubber pad moves even if your thumb just grazes it. Let alone, it's resting there the entire time I use this mouse I have to feel that damn thing move.",
          "Im a bit biased when it comes to steelseries. I love the company and the products they make, how well they work with each other, and love that their hardware and software are mac compatible. I have a gaming pc that i use for games but i also film and edit videos so it\u2019s great being able to switch from one or the other. I\u2019ve had this mouse for about a year maybe year and a half and my only complaint would be the grips on the mouse. they\u2019ve started to fall off",
          "This is my 2nd mouse that I have purchased and both I loved dearly. I even got pass that grips falling of by using baseball bat grip tape to add even better grip to the sides. But for both mouse the really only problem I have is the main mouse buttons. My first one after about a year started double clicking in the right button so when I would go to aim it would unaim and then go back. thought \"ok its getting old lets get a new one\" and now my second one, while not double clicking, the mouse buttons are wiggly and when I aim and hold down the right mouse button there is this weird \"plastic creaking\" feeling and its the smallest problem but annoys me so much that its almost unplayable. great mouse but be warned the main buttons seems to fail over time.",
          "This mouse is tight af. Got me clicking on heads and everyone think I got aimbot",
          "I got this mouse in a bundle for around $200 w/Arctis Pro Headset (no DAC) along w/Doom Eternal Certificate.TL;DR:Best mouse among all my other models for my natural palm grip.Best click feel EVER. (idc if \"Best\" is already implied)But the USB cable was DOA. (real reason for 4 stars) :CThis is compared to Corsair Harpoon RGB, Razer Mamba Wireless/Deathadder Elite v1, SteelSeries Rival 3, Logitech G402(Hyprion Fury), EQEOVGA D10Disclaimer:Everybody grips their mouse differently, and through their application and experiences they may prefer alternatives. (I've tried the Anker vertical mouse, not fit for my daily use)Also this is a review written after 2 weeks worth of use (avg. 3~5 hr. daily), not that long of usage/wear.History:I've started with Logitech G5, then the G502(old school 2005 ver.), but the biggest complaint was the weight and unnatural griping/design for me (couldn't get used to it for years) then I've tried the Razer series Deathadder Elite v1 & Mamba Wireless. (very similar but the both Razer's off-center \"ergo\" hump was not comfortable or natural for long periods. I thought that was the best the industry can offer. Until I decided to try other mouses. The Corsair Harpoon RGB was perfect for my palm but designed for claw grip therefore straining after awhile. Then I gave G402 Hyperion Fury a try (love the glide-ability (better mouse feet) and control(good weight!)) and palm gripping feels a bit better(strange, since G502 is a similar shape) but the left-click switch is more centered (more for claw/fingertip grip clicking). The SteelSeries Rival 3 was a great feel for my natural palm grip, but it is smaller and I find my bottom palm dragging on the mousepad. Then the EQEOVGA D10(Glorious O/D clone) was perfect in almost every way, except the mouse feet(kinda draggy) with the contrasting lightweight kinda throws me off a bit.Initial Review:The Rival 600 from the first several minutes was from joy to frustration, since the box-opening experience was wonderfully presented. But then realizing the included mouse Micro-USB cable was non-functional. (plugging in another was fine, but what if I don't have a repository of cables? speaking from other consumers standpoint)Also having to find a light but long enough Micro USB cable for a mouse was also frustrating.The 8 Zone RGB and Mouse management software (SteelEngine 3) is great. Pretty and simple.I don't bother with the weights, so I don't have an issue with the side-grip parts falling off(for now)Also they are magnetized so they should stay in place if not dropped/demagnetized.The dark meat of this review:When functional, the mouse feels natural and comfortable right away for my natural palm grip. Meaning, when immediately placed on mouse (unlike Logitech or Razer) I didn't need to adjust my grip at all.This mouse in its entirety is capable for me to naturally grip, hold, then manipulate without my rear palm to drag/touch the mouse pad. While able to keep contact with about 70% of my palm, which is very satisfying.All the while the soft-touch material is not noticeable at first, but whenever you liftoff, its assistance is more than appreciated.The click, oh my goodness the CLICK FEELS.Unlike any other mouses, the click is not your average, thin, crisp, light, or meek click.When you click, the feedback feels solid, but reverberates at a deeper click tone.It feels almost like a near-mushy but crisp tactility.There's no wiggle/flex(yet) of the primary mouse buttons, and the grooving on those feels natural/ergo.Bonus Facts:-The included cable actually feels heavier than the mouse!-I use a cable bungee so cable weight could be omitted.-Only 3 mouse feet/point of bottom contact. (interesting choice compared to other mouses, usually 4 or 5)-Only 2 DPI profile switching, strange since Rival 3 has up to 5.-SteelEngine 3 is pretty cool, easy, and simple compared to Razer's multi-program combo mess.-The Arctis Pro (no DAC) is perfect (minus haptic feedback or great sound) compared to Nari Ultimate.",
          "Pros: - Amazing Sensor - Amazing Software - Superb RGB Capabilities and very good looking lighting layout (RGB logo and strips  on the mouse look really good with any setup) - Clicking switches are alright, they DO doubleclick (which I didn't mind since it was only if you kind of slammed your finger on the mouse, plus I could click really really fast using the \"butterfly clicking\" technique which helped in some games) - Mouse buttons were big and easy to gripCONS: - BIGGEST CON IS THE SIDE PADS. As you may have read in other reviews, these are TERRIBLE. I went the summer without AC and they were coming off, the sticky residue getting everywhere etc. BUT I decided to re-apply some superglue to keep them on, which worked. It took ALOT of soap and water and cleaning to get the original adhesive off and you have to be careful when replacing them with the new adhesive, but it worked. - Didn't really get the whole \"vertical liftoff\" thing. Seemed to be better to keep it on the max or 1-below max setting no matter the mousepad used. -  White RGB had a little bit of a blue tint, but didn't bother me much. - Supposedly bad quality control, meaning your experience may vary ALOT.I'm a big fan of steelseries. I own the Rival 300 (which is broken now), the 100, and the 600. I am now using the Logitech G502 HERO as my daily gaming mouse and can recommend it to anyone a little bit turned off by these reviews. The new installment of the G502 has an even better sensor, and the cable is of much better quality than the previous generations. I'm sorry steelseries, but maybe next refresh will be the one. I have high hopes still <3",
          "Owned the mouse a little over a month. While I enjoy the mouse, the rubber grips on the side are starting to peel off. This is the first mouse I've had in 30 years of PC gaming that has literally started to fall apart. I dunno how I feel about that.As a mouse? It's one of the best mice I'd had, but... I'm kind of concerned about the longevity of it now.UPDATE: I got an RMA on the defective rubber adhesive and the new replacement pads came in. While they seem better, there's spilled adhesive glue on the outside of the pad. I can live with it, but I just feel like the QA leaves a bit to be desired here.UPDATE 2: The replacement rubber pad is already peeling off. It lasted a few days. I think I understand why SteelSeries openly sells replacement parts for this mouse on their site. The quality of the adhesive on these pads is absolutely TERRIBLE. I thought I got a dud. Alas. =/UPDATE 3: I'm already on my third (and last) set of replacement side panels. The build quality on these panels is poor. You can tell this is an obvious problem because Steel Series directly sells replacements for this panel. They know. If this last set doesn't hold I'm kinda over this mouse. I've paid $50 just to replace these, and trying to DIY a fix has been messy.",
          "This mouse, overall, is great.  It slides well on a steelseries mouse pad and tracks smoothly.  The DPI is highly customizable.  The buttons feel good and work well.  The RBG is customizable.  The software is easy to use.  It all works well....EXCEPT the rubber grips on this mouse failed (and I see through other people's reviews that it looks fairly common).  It looks like over time the glue (perhaps from the heat of your hand over time) fails and sort of oozes out in a gummy, sticky way.  I repaired this myself the first time it happened after a few months of use.  I did that buy removing the pads (not hard once the glue has failed) and re-applying super glue on all the pads.  This worked for about the same amount of time - a few more months.  It is now happening again.  The rubber grips start slowing sliding around while you use the mouse, and it is highly aggravating to me.While I do love the mouse overall, I won't buy it again because I'm tired of the rubber grips failing.  I'll have to try something else.",
          "I migrated to this mouse from a Corsair M65 a few months ago due to getting two bad products in a row. The hardware issues I kept having made me leave Corsair altogether, so I needed some new peripherals. I'd had hardware issues with Logitech before as well, so I decided to give Steelseries stuff a try.As far as this mouse goes, it feels a lot better in my hand than the M65. That mouse was a bit too bulky for my liking, this one feels more rounded and it feels like it conforms to my hand. I like the removable weight system, pretty standard but still good to see. The weights themselves are kind of hard to get to stay in though. I fought for probably 10 minutes trying to get two to stick in each side, they just kept falling out.The one thing that kills me about this mouse is pretty much every button besides the two main ones. There's three buttons on the left side, but only two of them work. You've got your standard mouse 4/mouse 5 buttons, but there's also a sixth button placed in front of them. This button is pretty small and doesn't sit in a natural place for my thumb, if I ever wanted to press it, I had to shift my whole hand forward on the mouse. Luckily, I'll never need to press it because it doesn't do anything. I configured it in the pretty lackluster software, but no game I tried to bind it to recognized it. Then I set it so that pressing it would be like pressing the A key on a keyboard. I opened up notepad, pressed it, but nothing happened. Set it to DPI toggle, nothing changed. It's like the button just doesn't work. There wasn't even the option to use it as a sniper button, which I miss from the M65. Trying to navigate to the dedicated DPI toggle button is clunky too. You can also only store two different DPI settings in a profile, the M65 had 5 levels you could set, with buttons to either go up or down.While I'm not going to stop using the Rival 600, I feel cheated. I was planning on having a custom button that I could set up for different games, but I'm left with less options than my previous mouse. Luckily, since it does feel more comfortable I'm okay with continuing to use it, but it wouldn't take much to get me to try another Corsair mouse.",
          "**Edited x2** Went from 1 to 4 to 2 StarsTLDR - I don't like it, I wanted to love it, but it let me down. I don't like the software, Too much hassle trying to get the thing to work properly. Thought I fixed the crashing issue but it happed again tonight. Then spent a few hours trying to fix the software from crashing when I was trying to make different color profiles. It could of been a great mouse, but with all the technical issues, its not worth the price tag. Printed out a return tag and sending it out in the morning.***Gonna leave the old review if for some reason helps someone***I'll get right into it.Fits my hand nicely. I have a strange grip, I think. I don't really pay attention to how people hold there peripherals. I have a sort of modified claw grip I suppose. Have a slight inverted angle, around 15 degrees counter clockwise. Majority of my hand doesn't rest on the mouse. Its primarily manipulated by my thumb and ring finger, with a bit of tertiary support from my pinky. Old boxer fracture of my 5th metacarpal  set wrong, and its shaped like the end of a hockey stick.Oh, Yeh, I have large ham-hocks for hands. 7.5 inches wrist to tip of index finger X 4 inches across palm to base of thumb roughly. I think they are big anyway.I would guess it would fit best with similar claw  grips. Cant speak for palm grips, they never felt right for me.Never payed much attention to how often i lift the mouse off the pad, but turns out I do quite a bit. I have not experienced any unwanted mouse movement with lifting it, so i suppose the extra sensor is doing its job nicely.Clicks feel good, solid, and precise, especially the mouse wheel click. Its oddly pleasurable.Can Manipulate weight (I like heavy mice so I load it up). Installing the 4g weights is a little janky, but once they are in, they haven't moved. Could offset the weights of sides for more custom feel to it. Weights come in a nice little case that can be wrapped around the cord, so you won't lose it. It believe stock with no weights its around 100g, which is too much for you \"high speed FPS\" guys. Comes with 8, 4g weights with 4 slots on each side of the mouse. Cover is magnetic so no tools needed. They stay on good, cant imagine them moving without you wanting them to. Personally I like the weighty mice. Lighter mice I used in the past felt like I would crush it just by using it.Slides across my mouse pad (using an old Razer Vespula,a dual sided hard pad with a wrist rest). Its noticeably more smooth than my old Logitech G500/G600. Could of been of years of use I suppose, but I was not expecting that much of a difference. Considering a fabric pad to ease on the wear of the pads because of this.The Sensor on these Steel series mice are top freaking notch, would recommend them on that much alone.Everything about this mouse is great, even the silly rgb lights. They were not a consideration when I decided to purchase them, but they kind of grown on me. Never really thought about having my stuff match up and customizable lights really help with it. The Software is Janky... its certainly not the worst (looking at you Razer)  I have used, but could be better. Its one of my main complaints I guess. Other RBG elements of my Rig don't play nice with each other and would very much like them all synced up. Not that I have much at this point. Just my keyboard and some fans. If RGB is a big deal for you, you kinda get stuck with one manufacture for all your stuff. Not everyone makes good everything, most have one or two things they do really well. From what I read SteelSeries Keyboards are kinda meh, compared to Corsair's Keyboards. Their Mice seem to be there thing. I also own Their Arctis 7 Head Set and is pretty decent, good mic. Certainly the best wireless headset I owned. Just seems the the Low bass Ranges seem to be missing a bit. Well that is irrelevant, sorry tend to ramble.The Cord is not braided for some reason. Most gaming mice I picked up were braided. Im guessing its because its removable. Not sure why that is actually, there is no wireless functionality as far as I know. Not really all that big of a deal for me because i use one of them mice noodles..woobies..dongles... whatever the hell they are called, they keep the cord from rubbing and wearing on the desk. Also helps with drag as well. They are cheap for the most part, would recommend getting them, Just can't seem to recall what they are called at the moment. Think mine is from Cougar..Bunker I think its called. Whatever...doesn't matter.So Price, its a quality mouse, price still stung/stings, no braided cord, Janky software (still serviceable) are pretty much my only issues with it and they are kinda niggling.Now for the reason I gave it a 1 star rating for a while was because I was having problems with it randomly stop responding. I would have to unplug it it to get it going again. Complete DQ when it comes to gaming mice! Especially the for the twitchy competitive games out there.I did a bunch of stuff to try and figure out what the issue was. Not sure what actually got it to behave.I disabled power management of the USB controllers in the device manager (no reason for them to be on unless your running a laptop anyway).Tried changeing different USB Ports(currently in one of my 3.0 USB Ports)Removed and reinstalled drivers, and Steelengine. At this point, i suspect it is USB driver related, Windows 7 does queer things. I am scrubbing and installing Win 10 on the weekend. Maybe should finally get around to teaching my self Linux, but I digress.I no longer have this issue, again, don't even think it was fault of the mouse to begin with. If you have similar issues. I would try what I talked about above.Overall would recommend the Rival 600, 4 stars for me is Good. I don't give out 5 Stars for anything less than God Teir products. Not that do reviews often anyway.'Wish companies would play nice and make it easier for syncing RBG elements. Not  holding my breath on that though, more likely to find some bored nerd on the interwebs to come up with a program.I'd perhaps wait on a sale, but I don't regret the purchase. If you actually read of of this , You deserve a cookie.Even took some pictures with my old  Note 2 of yore, circa 2013. Not the greatest quality.Thanks,Chris B",
          "Finally, there is the \u201cSteelSeries Rival 600\u201d gaming mouse. This mouse is unique for its dual optical sensor that accounts for lift-off of the mouse from the table. This means that the mouse stops detecting inputs from the first sensor if the second sensor detects that the mouse has been lifted off the desk. This is a design feature that very few mice have ever incorporated into their design. It also has a weight system where you can add grams of weight by adding or removing the small weights from under the mouses side panels, this is very handy if you want to increase the weight of the mouse to fit your preference. This mouse also features the standard 2 left-sided buttons that many of these gaming mice have, as well as one on the top.I would rate this mouse quite highly but there is one big design flaw in the rubber panels on the side of the mouse, and that flaw (which I referenced earlier on a similar mouse) is that the rubber grip bits on each side of the mouse get warmed up by my hand and eventually started sliding, revealing the warmed glue, and making the mouse permanently sticky and that glue often transferred to my hand, making it quite unpleasant to use after a while of owning the device. The liftoff sensor and the weight customizability are not enough to redeem this mouse and for the glue alone, I give this mouse a 6/10. This mouse would be a 8/10 or 9/10 easily if I never had this issue, but using this mouse was unbearable once the glue started to go and my hands were sticky every time that I wanted to play a game for more than an hour.",
          "i really like this mouse. the rubber grips on the side are really comfy and the mouse has sort of a soft touch feeling to it rather than feeling like cheap hard plastic. i decided to use the Rival 5 over this mouse just because it fit my own hand a little bit better, but everything else about the 600 felt and looked more premium than its successor. the Rival 5 feels much cheaper, and literally the only reason i decided to keep the 5 is because it just feels like it fits a bit better with my current setup and the amount of space i have at my desk and how i\u2019m positioned. overall i\u2019d honestly say the 600 is the nicer of the two mouses in terms of pure quality, and i also think it\u2019s one of the coolest looking mouses available. i\u2019d definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a really really really nice mouse. definitely a HUGE step up from most basic mouses like the Rival 3 or the Logitech G203 or Razer DeathAdder or Viper or anything along those lines.",
          "This mouse was a replacement for my Razer Mamba which I loved but sadly a little brother slammed it on the desk and now the sensor is inusable.  At the time I also had the Logitech 503 and Razer Deathadder Elite gaming mice which was my current competitive fps mouse.  But I saw the reviews and ads for this work of art of a mouse and decided to buy it to see if it could take my gaming to the next level....and boy was it worth it.  The first match I played in csgo was a competitive match with a friend, and we both are at least decently skilled at the game (me being a dmg and him a mg2) and we know each other's average rate of kills and such.  But In that game with that mouse, I destroyed having 48 kills with a 73% headshot ratio.  The smooth feeling of my aim while still retaining a snappyness felt more emphasized compared to my Razer deathadder, it took no time for my long fingers and palm to go from a claw grip to a palm grip (which this mouse I do believe is more inclined towards using a palm grip with it's elongated and lower chassis form).  The smoothness definitely took a few minutes to get used to and the extra perk of being able to adjust your weights was certainly a nice touch.  Everything about this mouse was great.... until a peculiar thing happened.I was in a competitive match for Destiny 2 with my clanmates and I felt a very sticky solution on the left side of the mouse where my thumb usually grips.  At first I was mad at myself for getting some oil from Pizza on the mouse (so I though), so I wiped it off and continued, next thing I know I feel the same solution which I had wiped off, and I knew it wasn't pizza oil this time.What happened was somehow the adhesive which holds the rubber side grips to the chassis wall was somehow \"LEAKING\" ,if that's the right word to use, from the top seam onto the grip and frankly it is annoying the crap out of me.  But I don't believe that this is a common problem, but that is the only reason why I took a star off for durability.Overall, if you are looking to by a competitive FPS mouse to take your gaming to the next level, this mouse won't disappoint with it's amazing sensor and above average feeling quality (The feeling of quality is of course my opinion and may or may not cater to your expectations).  The only gripe I have is really probably a problem only I and a select few may be facing.",
          "Mouse is HEAVY even without the extra weights on. No flicks with this mouse happens, only tracking.The hump on the back does not support a palm grip.I bought this mouse hoping it was durable. Side grips fell off 8 months in. Then left click, mouse button 1, stopped holding (and sometimes doesn't register clicking) after 11 months in. Did not know the mouse had a 1 year warranty. Now, I am stuck with a RGB paper weight 13 months in. Can't ask for replacement...Software is also bloatware. It has this game capture feature turned on by default, and the overlay is annoying to deal with.",
          "The adjustability with the software is really good. I can fine tune it just for me. That also includes the removeable weights on either side as I like my mouse to have some weight to it. One issue is that the sensor can be a little finicky when on certain surfaces, but so far a sensor calibration has fixed it. The other issue is the rubber pads on the sides. After about 6 months they started coming off. The manufacturer uses a really slimy/ greasy glue so its hard to get a clean surface to re-glue them. Overall though, its been worth the money.",
          "I received this mouse a little over 2 years ago. It's comfortable and performs really well. I was extremely happy with the mouse until just recently.The glue that holds to non-slip rubber that your thumb and ring finger rest on has failed. The pads now slide around, I'm sure in a couple more months they would just fall off completely.For such a price a 2 year life span isn't worth it.",
          "Not a gamer.  I use it for Photoshop and Lightroom.  I like the weight (I have all the weights in) and like the ergonomics, except the adhesive for the side pads melts with usage, rendering the mouse sticky and unpleasant to use.  I bought a replacement set of pads, cleaned up the mouse with alcohol, and the new pads started sliding around and became sticky after a month of use.  Whatever they're using for adhesive, it sucks.",
          "Coming from a 120+ gram Roccat Nyth (great mouse with modular thumb buttons, and I used it in the wide setup for ring finger support), this is a light, joyful experience in the hand. I am using no additional weights. After watching Rocket Jump Ninja's excellent reviews, I decided this was the proper fit for my hands (over the Logitech g403 and SteelSeries Rival 310). It's easy enough to setup with the software (SteelSeries Engine 3), and the automatic recognition of games/programs works quickly. I have used both Roccat and Logitech software for programming mice, and they're all somewhat opaque at first. I think each need some UI work when it comes to selecting profiles to be edited. They all work well enough.The first Rival 600 I orderd was an Amazon Warehouse deal for a used mouse. It was like new and seemed to work flawlessly...but it had an issue that others have reported elsewhere online: the firmware would not load. Indeed, the software periodically became unresponsive, and the mouse sometimes failed to swap profiles. Additionally, when waking my PC from sleep or booting up, the mouse would not respond besides lighting up the LEDs (although the two middle strips were flickering noticeably). So after interacting with SteelSeries customer support through their website, they decided I ought to RMA it. In the interest of time, I returned the defective unit to Amazon directly and purchased a new one. It came with up-to-date firmware already installed. Now the software works great in concert.",
          "I love this mouse. I've been using this mouse for three years now, and if it ever failed me I would buy this mouse again. I have only one minor complaint.There are two soft rubber pads on the sides of this mouse held on by adhesive. This adhesive failed after about a year of use, and the pads began to slide. The adhesive would get on my fingers, it was unpleasant. I simply pulled them off, and cleaned the adhesive beneath with tiny bit of soap and water, which I applied with paper towel. It took maybe 5 minutes to clean.This mouse would be better without those pads in the first place. Losing them has had zero impact on comfort or performance. This minor complaint does not in any way impact my satisfaction or my product rating. This mouse is as near to perfect as any I've ever used.",
          "This mouse took a day or two to get used to due to the fact that I am using all the weights it came with and is heavier than previous mice I have used. Without the weights it is pretty light but does not feel cheap. Performance is great as well - very smooth. The steelseries software is easy to use and worked right away. Only gripe is the 3 side buttons feel as though they should be easier to click - the most front facing of the three is definitely a stretch to reach and they take more pressure/effort to press down than I would like. Overall it is still a great mouse and I would purchase it again.* Update - 4 months after purchase, the pad on the top right corner of the mouse where you grip with your ring/pinky fingers has fallen off. I still really like the mouse, so I'll probably just glue it back on myself but I was disappointed the mouse didn't stay in better shape for longer.",
          "It's Steel Series.",
          "So I got this through amazon warehouse under acceptable which, usually means it was returned but it might be banged up. My acceptable was a mouse someone switched out with their old one, it was a bit moldy, missing cables and weights, grip was coming off. This doesn't happen in less than 30 days. Ordered a second one under like new. The mouse was new, had everything, no scratches, feels great.Mouse feels amazing, moves smoothly, one of the best gliding mice I've ever used. My favorite mice have been from razer, but the double clicking issues and the driver problems are a nightmare. This mouse felt like it could replace it. I've been looking for something with maybe 3 to 6 buttons max on the side for MOBA's. I tried this and the side buttons are as stiff as a board. I have to grip the mouse in a way so that I can get the buttons to click. I can almost live with this, but the third button on the side is a nightmare. You need way too much force to get it to trigger on the side. Because of the size and the angle, you need to really reach to get to the middle of the button. Because of the length of all the side buttons, you have to reposition your hand to get to that 3rd button. This makes this mouse from one of the best feeling mice to one of the worst mice for playing a MOBA or any other game you're likely to use shortcuts for. I caught myself overthinking and preparing for scenarios that hadn't happened yet. Playing a healer role, this is terrible.I guess the other design gripe is that the sides for some reason detach for you to put the weights in. The mouse doesn't feel like it needs weights, and if you were given a choice, there are definitely different places they could've chosen to allow you to modify. If the mouse was ever released with smaller buttons on the sides or buttons that didn't need so much force, I'd definitely try it again.",
          "To start off i absolutely loved this mouse when i got it, and if it was built better I would still love this mouse.I purchased mine in August of 2018, and for the first year everything was perfect and it felt fantastic to use. After the one year mark, the rubber pad where my index finger rests started coming off, as did the pad where my pinky wrests on the right side of the mouse. This started becoming an issue while gaming because the flap of rubber at the bottom would make contact with my mousepad, generating a ton of friction.At this point I used epoxy to fix the rubber pads securely back to the mouse, but eventually the smaller front pad came off again and I had to completely remove it. Now the same thing has started to happen on the thumb pad, and at this point I cannot be busied with making repairs to whats apparently a poorly built mouse, and have switched back to my old mouse, a Logitech MX518, which despite being almost a decade old, has never let me down.Now on to the good, the mouse is otherwise fantastic, it feels great in the hand, the buttons are nice and clicky, the scroll wheel feels great, the customize-able weights are fantastic for getting the right weight, its a very enjoyable mouse for the first year. If SteelSeries can find a way to make the rubber pads on the sides of the mouse more durable it would be an absolute game changer.Overall I would rate this mouse a 3/5 due to the issues I had with it, but I will not hesitate to pick up the next iteration so long as the build quality is rectified.",
          "Overall it's a great weighted mouse but my biggest complaint are the rubber grips. Them being rubber grips is already not that great in my opinion; any mouse maker should leave grips to third party markets or make them as a separate thing for the mouse as an accessory but not on the mouse itself. Not only do the rubber grips not feel good, but the adhesive used for them is not that great either and started losing its stickiness and had the rubber moving/sliding around on the mouse. If they make a second iteration of this mouse, I hope they use plastic instead of rubber grips and use usb c instead of micro usb for its connection.",
          "Rival 600 is the most fantastic mouse I have ever put my oversized hands on. It immediately felt great and it just molded to my hand so well. The sensors felt very snappy. And my aim is 10x more precise than with any corsair and razer mouse I've used. The rgb looks nice. The software wasn't difficult to navigate for me and hasn't seemed bloated or made computer sluggish. It's a near perfect mouse in every way and has immediately made me better at the games I love. The R+L clicks on the front are a separate piece of plastic from the body, meaning your fingers resting will be less likely to accidentally hold the buttons down. (had this problem with corsair glaive and m65.) scroll wheel is easiest scroll wheel click I've felt. The list just goes on. As long as the mouse lasts a long time, it's the best. Time will tell, but right now I'm gushing about it every day. Screaming my love for this mouse from the rooftops.ConsNo braided cable, it's rubber and it sticks. (the cable detaches and you can connect braided micro USB, I've done it.)Side buttons took a little getting used to over the corsair glaive.The finish feels slippery but has not proven to be a problem in game.",
          "For newer Mac users the software provided by SteelSeries is not compatable.  I'm running Monterey and the software will not function. I also have an older Mac running Sierra and a Rival 500, and the SS software works well! The mouse does work fine on Monterey, but the companion software is not ready for newer Macs. Note to SteelSeries: please fix this. Newer Mac users want to send you money...",

          "First, I need to start with the quality:It's good.  The mouse itself feels good on my hand.  I like its weight system which involves 8 different weights (4 on each side of the mouse).  I prefer my mice heavy so this really worked well.  I could imagine that this would work well for people who like lightweight mice, too.  The exterior of the mouse seems to have a siliconized layer to it.  It's soft to the touch and I didn't experience any discomfort with my hand resting on the mouse.Setup was convenient, too.  I plugged in the mouse directly and it installed the software for managing the mouse directly.  It was a nice touch.But that is not to say there aren't downsides:1) The thumb buttons aren't well placed.  Buttons 4 & 5 feel very out of place.  They're very skinny and don't have a tall enough profile to feel where you should be pressing.2) Button 6 (that one that LOOKS like it should be a sniper button) can, in no way, be configured to behave like a sniper button.  This was the greatest disappointment for me.  I like to have my mouse be sensitive most times.  Every once in a while, I need to be a lot more accurate and I don't have a good way to do that.  A sniper button is a great way to give me that on demand.  The lack of it left me unable to quickly do the things I want.3) Sensitivity settings: The software will only let you have 2 sensitivity settings.  I couldn't find a way to add more settings into the cycle.  This made it really difficult to get things the way I wanted for the various things I do from playing an online FPS to doing multi-monitor dev work.I feel like this COULD be an outstanding product worth every penny with just a few refinements but the 3 issues above are deal-breakers for me.  If they're not for you, this could be a usable product.  I've initiated a refund.",
          "I feel like this is a great mouse, though I\u2019ve only used it for about a month before my left click stopped responding for some reason. I had repaired that myself, but I was unable to replace from Amazon prior. I ended up buying another Rival 650 Mouse from the SteelSeries.com site directly. If you buy the mouse there, you will have a 1 year warranty. Better to purchase through there instead of Amazon because Amazon does not have a warranty for this item.",
          "This mouse was incredible (steel series rival 650 wireless). I loved the customizable rgb color, I loved being able to switch back and forth between wireless and wired with ease, I loved being able to change the weight of the mouse, etc\u2026 Everything was perfect, until a week ago. I turned on my computer, and had an update for steel series program. So I updated it and it restarted my computer. Once it booted back up, now my mouse will not work properly. Every button works fine, except the primary click button (the click button on the left). In order for the mouse to register a click, the button has to be held down. And the worst part, is if you hold too long, it doesn\u2019t register a click with most things, and rather, a click and drag. So at this point it is impossible to use. I\u2019ve checked all the settings within the app and the windows settings. Not only have the settings not changed, but nothing is out of the ordinary in the first place. So either this update ruined it, or the mouse stopped working. Either way, I\u2019m livid. What mouse that you buy for over $120 dollars breaks in a little over 1 year. Ridiculous.",
          "I have been using this mouse for more than 1 year. The side grip rubber pad failed in less than 1 year, and SteelSeries support sent me a new set of side grips. The longevity of the mouse is questionable. Idk if they will fix this with better side grips.Pros:- Ergonomics is excellent. This mouse fits my hand perfectly and I could use it for hours without feeling fatigue or uncomfortable.- Wireless lag is unnoticeable. The Sensei wireless terrible, but this one is great.- Nice RGB.Cons:- Poor battery life. Wouldn't last 3 days of daily use.- Weight!! This mouse is super heavy compared to other lightweight wireless mouse.- Crap side grip. The glue is weak and the rubber does not feel good.",
          "After a month or so using this mouse, I've come to the conclusion it's literally the best mouse I've ever used.  I'll break the review down in sections:Ergonomics:  I'm an athletic guy who has larger hands, so a lot of mice never quite felt like they fit in my hand correctly.  This mouse is wide and fits in my hand perfectly. Additionally, the added weights to give it some additional feedback when moving it around and has for the first time in my life alleviated that stiffness I get when using smaller mice for hours.Functionality:  The additional programmable buttons are great, as I've used this mouse in business applications mapping macros to them, and the scroll wheel rocks when I'm using multiple spreadsheets at once.  I also tested it out in a few FPS, and RTS titles to see how it faired and it has amazing response time, and accuracy. For my usage, I found the customization through SteelSeries software to be easy to use, however, it's overkill for my needs.  Not a bad thing, as people who love to fully customize it have that option.Battery:  I literally used this mouse for a week on one charge - at a minimum for 4-5 hours a day without having to recharge.  I didn't run it until it died, but to say the battery life beats any of the other wireless mice I've used.Build Quality:  This is where I highly endorse this product - the build quality is top of the line - period.  I've used both Logitech, and Razer products in the past, and this product blows away my former favourite Razer Trinity by a large margin.  Maybe it's the combination of plastic, rubber, and metal weights that gives it a tank feel, but even the buttons feel weighty when using them - which I prefer.  Plus it's wireless which only adds to the benefit.Cost:  It's not the cheapest, but I believe you pay for what you get and SteelSeries delivers high value for cost.Recommendation:  I fully recommend this mouse to anyone who has large hands, likes heavier mice, and wants to have wireless capabilities.  You won't be disappointed.",
          "Overall I use my mouse for several hours a day, especially since I work from home. I bought the mouse at the end of March 2021, and after about 6 months of use the side rubber pannels started to slide out of place due to the rubber adhesive melting under the heat of my hands. That being said, I'm not a lava monster, and my hands are not excessively warm. It hasn't bothered me enough to buy a new one, but its enough of an inconvenience that I came on here to give the mouse a 2 stars. So... 5 stars for the first 6 months or so, then the stars fall off as easy as the adhesive sides.The mouse is wireless, but I rarely use it as such - so I didn't judge the battery life.",
          "I've been using this mouse every day for around 5 months at the time of writing this review. tl;dr: Feels and performs great, but potentially falls short in battery life and software.PROS:+ The shape, size, and weight are all super comfortable and ergonomic. It molds right into your hand, and it's light enough to move with your fingertips. Weighting feels balanced where no matter where I move it, nothing feels like it's dragging or being pulled behind, if that makes sense.+ Sensor or polling rate offer perfect performance as far as I can tell.+ I didn't think I would like the rubberized texture, but it grew on me. It doesn't get shiny/sticky like the usual matte plastic shell of other mice.+ Looks good, cool RGB lighting with a bunch of zones that are highly customizable.+ Buttons are all placed well, feel natural to click without having to reach around or contort fingers. Scroll wheel is also very nicely smooth without being harshly tactile nor too mushy.CONS:- Mediocre battery life, at least with RGB on. I absolutely hated how quickly this thing's battery died until I turned RGB off completely, and then it seemed acceptable. Expect about 2 days of use with RGB on, and maybe 5 days without - I just know that I have to charge it more often than my Logitech G900 which seems to last at least a week per charge. On the plus side, it does charge back to full quickly.- A mess while plugged in! If it auto-sleeps while plugged in (a default feature), I can't use it anymore - no moving or clicks - unless I unplug it, turn it off & back on, and re-plug it. In addition, my custom button functions and macros stop working after this happens until I kill the Steelseries software and launch it again. In addition, at some point after using while plugged in for a while, it sometimes start to continuously disconnect and reconnect (with accompanying Windows sounds repeating) and freezing my whole PC while this is happening, again until I unplug it and turn it off & back on. A really negative experience on an otherwise really likable mouse.Overall I'd still definitely recommend this mouse for gaming. It's definitely one of the most balanced and comfortable mice on the market that feels comfortable to use all day, with only a few minor grievances.",
          "This mouse is exactly the same as the wired rival 600, which I have.  I thought that the twenty for hour battery life would be enough but it was not. and with the rgb on that cut it in half.  It seemed like a was charging it almost everyday which would defeat the purpose of having a wireless mouse.  Everything else about the mouse is great, it has rgb zones that you can customize, very comfortable for palm and grip users, and very responsible clicks; which do tend to be a bit loud if have anyone else in the room with you",
          "if you want a heaver mouse and wireless highly recomend this one barely have to charge it and i use it a lot also get it to turn off in three min for max battery life one click and it come back on almost instantly so dont worry about it turning off mid game its got a red flashing light on the scroll wheel when its about to die",
          "Great quality weight and build. Extremely easy to pair and use. Battery life is good and it charges quickly.",
          "I\u2019ve been using a fairly cheap off brand gaming mouse for sometime now because I believed that a mouse couldn\u2019t make that much difference in ones gaming experience. Boy was I wrong! I purchased the Steel Series Rival 650 Wireless Gaming Mouse because I had finally broke my other mouse on accident and man what a difference I\u2019ve seen in my first person gameplay! I\u2019ve been able to take advantage of so many custom settings to get everything just perfect for my use. Since I\u2019ve configured the mouse, I\u2019ve noticed a lot higher placements in my Warzone finishes, my shots are more target  with almost aimbot like accuracy and precision! I have this mouse setup with the prism XL gaming mouse pad and the Apex Pro keyboard and I love how the all can be configured to show the same color configurations during use! I haven\u2019t had any issues with the battery levels as it has good battery saver settings and charges extremely fast for all day gameplay! Buy the Rival 650 and set your self on a path for success!",
          "Software was easy to use, the weights really allowed me to adjust the mouse to my preferred weight profile. If has 3 addition buttons which are useful but not overwhelming so nothing goes to waste. Two DPI speeds on the fly is all I really need.They advertise it as such, so I can't complain, but that 10 hour battery life goes quick, so the mouse spends a lot of time being a 'wired mouse', but the perk is that when I really need it to be wireless, its as easy as pulling the cable out of the mouse and getting 10 solid hours of use. You can eek out a little more time by turning off RGB and the like if you are need of a little more time too.All in all very happy, and I have it sync'd up with Steel Series RGB XL mouse pad, so they follow the same light patterns etc when they are asleep and stay solid colors when I'm gaming.",
          "Used Logitech products nearly forever.  Tossed my G700s mouse for this one a little over a year ago.  G700s was touted as being Logitech's most durable mouse but it only lasted about a year in my hand before it became unreliable due to what I assumed was worn or dirty switches.  I was skeptical about buying a mouse that was not from Logitech but I was fed up with the lack of durability in the Logitech product line and decided to try something different.  This Rival 650 wireless mouse did not disappoint me.  It is comfortable in my hand and it's performance is excellent.  The one complaint I have about the mouse is the same one many others have:  the glue holding the rubber pads on the side panels fails after a time.  Mine lasted about a year.  Others have not had such good luck.  I've ordered new side panels for my mouse and will replace the pads on my current side panels after I receive the new panels because I am sure the glue will also fail on them.  I will use better glue than the manufacturer did.  No other issues with this product.",
          "I recently got onto the RGB craze (mouse pad, keyboard, desk lighting, headset stand, speakers, etc..)So naturally a Mouse woul be a welcome addition, so far its been good, unfortunately with each peripheral, being from different manufacturers there is a new agent you have to install to run/customize the application, i do believe however once the application has customized the hardware that you can turn it off as the settings are saved onto the mouse,so that is a plus.The quick charge feature (charge for 10 minutes get *hours of gaming) is nice and should be available on all devices, not just mobile phones these days.the only one issue i had (twice since owning it this week) is a disconnect while connected via cable while playing Hitman 2 on the PC, sound stuttered then usb device was not recognized , only disconnecting the cable from charging and using the receiver revived the mouse, weird however it happened twice, so...the color customization has 8 zones, EIGHT!!, which makes it look really cool as each zone is customizable, different colors random colors, breathing, static, etc.. it really is a beautiful mouse.This mouse comes with weights that lets you customize the mouse to your preference in heft, i feel that its heavy enough as it is, as it replaced my logitech g620 and the weight is on par with that mouse.Would definitely recommend-Mr. J",
          "There appears to be a known issue with the scroll wheel becoming inconsistent after some time. Scrolling either direction will result in not registering or scrolling the opposite way. The only fix is to disassemble the mouse and thoroughly clean it. Not something I would have expected from such a highly rated mouse.",
          "As of the writing of this review, I have had this mouse for a little under 6 months.Overall, the performance has been very good. The mouse is a bit heavy for FPS use, but I didn't mind so much. The sensor is great, and out of the box the scroll wheal has an excellent feel. I chose this mouse because I have relatively large hands, and I don't have a lot of options in mice (even with this relatively large mouse I can not play palm grip). Battery life is ok, but not great, software is usable, but not amazing. Removable side grips, and adjustable weight isn't all that useful since the mouse is already very heavy.If you get past the weight of this mouse, the main disadvantage to performance is the side grips. The side grips are rubberized but somewhat slick. The angle of the outside grip is sloped in the wrong direction. That is to say, normally on a mouse there will be a slight inward angle at the bottom of the grip so the device rests on your fingers, on this device, the outer grip continues an angled slope outward which makes it a bit more difficult to pick up. The overall result is that the mouse grips feel insecure in hand when gaming. This is not something that you will notice during lite use, but it matters during gaming sessions.Overall I would give this mouse 4 out of 5 stars. Steelseries could have done quite a few things to improve this mouse. The adjustable weight system is silly on an overweight mouse, and it just adds more weight. Better grip material and better grip angle would improve the feel by quite a bit.However I am giving this mouse 2 stars because of build quality. I received this mouse in January, by April, something broke in the mouse wheel. This did not impact performance, but gave a weird buzzing vibration when using the wheel. In early May, the rubberized grip pads started to come off. Needless to say this is pretty disappointing for a mouse that retails over 100 dollars.",
          "I like heavy mice and this comes with plenty of weight without increasing size like the Rat7 I used to have. Accurate and low latency on wireless mode.My only complaint if you could call it that is I feel like I have to charge it pretty often, but I also use my computer a lot so maybe I'm asking too much of it. It also has a battery indicator light that flashes when it comes out of sleep and so whenever I see it flashing yellow or red I know to plug it in if I'm not actively gaming.For FPS games in particular I find a cord hinders my movement enough to affect my performance so I can keep it plugged in for casual gaming or typical computer usage and unplug the cable for high speed maneuvering. Works great!",
          "First things first, this is not a paid review. As with all my purchases, I bought this with my own money, so this review is 100% unbiased. I've had my share of mice over the 30+ years using computers, and this is by far my favorite. It's very comfortable in the hand, and most importantly, the buttons have a clicky feel. Meaning, you can feel and hear when there's a mouse click. Another nice feature is the buttons are covnvex, meaning there's a dish for your fingers to rest. This design aides in accidental clicks. A very welcomed feature indeed. I have big hands (8.5\" from base of palm to tip of middle finger), and this mouse is very comfortable in my hand. I've had zero accidental clicks so far, and the precision is excellent. They claim \"lag free\" but that's not a true statement. There's a slight amount of lag, but not a deal breaker. In fact, it's barely noticeable (.5ms I believe) You'll get 12 hours of usage from just a 10 minute charge too!",
          "Llevo varios meses us\u00e1ndolo y estoy bastante satisfecho. Lo m\u00e1s importante es que no tiene ning\u00fan problema de latencia o desconexiones u otros inconvenientes de ese tipo. El software que incluye es relativamente f\u00e1cil de utilizar y no he tenido problemas con \u00e9l. La carga dura un par de d\u00edas. En cu\u00e1nto a la precisi\u00f3n no tengo quejas. El cable que utiliza para cargarse en micro USB y no es tan c\u00f3modo al momento de conectarse. Ser\u00eda m\u00e1s feliz si hubieran implementado una conexi\u00f3n USB tipo C (y/o carga inal\u00e1mbrica).",
          "battery life is roughly 6 hours when RGB is on and max polling is on. Very comfortable.Buttons on side are smaller than my logitech G502, but this prevents accidental inputs.button 6 is deactivated by default and is not recognized as an input for most games. needs to be mapped to a key. charges to full battery in 1 hour from dead. currently working with steelseries for issue involving profile switching with XBOX gamepass games. will update later.",
          "Purchased this for my son. He uses it for gaming and says it\u2019s working great.",
          "So... I feel I should say it's not a bad mouse. It feels comfortable, it registers clicks comfortably, and it's fairly smooth.However, the odd placement of the front thumb button is a major inconvenience. I figured I'd get comfortable with it and learn to love it, but it's primarily going unused now... And 3 months after delivery, I finally see what the 1 star reviews said... The rubber pieces for dinner placement are essentially melting off. I just put my hand on it and thought \"something's wrong, it feels different\" as I looked at it the adhesive is just coming off... Like it's wearing out and now my hand is sticky because I wasn't aware of it beforehand.I officially feel like I have to be replaced it, nobody wants their $110 gaming mouse to look like it's going apart or worse yet, like it feel apart, but \"it works\".I like steel series gear. I feel like I was slightly betrayed here... If it's the steel series, find a different model, if it's the RGB, find a different model, if it's the adjustable weight, find a different model, unfortunately I didn't return it within the 30 day window and now I've gotta find someone to park it off on to make half the money back to find something that will last me a little longer than 3 months...Sad day.",
          "I like big mouses. This one is quite large. I'm not pro enough to modify the weights honestly, I just put them all in and leave them there.Be aware that if you drop this mouse it will explode into a shower of tiny 4g weights and you'll spend some time searching for them.",
          "I'm so sorry for my original review and my 1 star, what happened was that I did not plug in the charging cable well, meaning I did not press hard enough and for this I thought I got a damaged one, but studying how to repair mice on reddit I found this idea to press hard on the cable or not that hard but well, and immediately it worked perfectly, now if I am very satisfied.",
          "This is a GREAT mouse! The ergonomics, battery life, and SteelSeries software are all great. I have no issues with the performance of the mouse. Everything about it's performance is up to the high standard I hold SteelSeries' peripherals. The software is generally pretty easy to use as well.The issue - as many have mentioned before - is with the adhesive used to hold the rubber grips on the (removable) side panels. I had the mouse for about 6 months before the adhesive began to let go and the rubber grip started to slide around. I contacted their customer service and they sent a new set of side panels completely free of charge . Their customer service is GREAT, btw.This is a great mouse but the build quality prevents it from being the perfect mouse. I had issues with L******h and C*****r mice and they were both frankly disappointing with regards to build quality and product lifespan. But this mouse broke down FAR quicker than the other two. Granted, the issue was much easier to fix and more readily supported by the manufacturer.",
          "I chose to buy this mouse for two reasons:1) Many people at my work had the same cheap wireless mouse and the signals kept crossing2) My laptop's keyboard and my headset are Steelseries and I have liked their products so farPros:- Tracking is excellent- No input lag- Great battery life- Easily programmable RGBCons:- All buttons aren't easily accessible from one grip position. If you want to use the forward-most side button, the rear-most one will be out of reach, as will the scroll wheel. If you want the rear-most button and mouse wheel accessible, you'll have to reach for the third button. If used for gaming, it essentially only has two side buttons.- Adding weights is  more of a gimmick. Some people may want to add the weights; it definitely gives it more heft. I play FPSs and MOBAs and don't see how adding weight to this mouse gives any advantage.I bought this mouse because I knew no one else at my work would have the same one. That is definitely the case. I wouldn't replace my current mouse on my gaming desktop, but this will serve my working travel laptop well. That said, it's probably not worth the price point for most consumers. Mine was a pretty niche necessity.If you want a casual, portable mouse, something cheaper will probably be fine.If you want a gaming mouse, spend your money on something better.",
          "Went from a Rival 310 to this beauty. I love the feel of this mouse and the ease of use of it. The weights may not matter for some people but for me I love the fact that I can adjust the weight with ease. I mostly keep it wired but I do love the fact that it is wireless if I do some lazy gaming in bed. Overall it was a great purchase especially during prime day. 10/10 would buy again but wish they had a white version or different colored options.",
          "It feels like a million bucks. Feels way more smooth and accurate than the Logitech G502, is made of premium feeling materials, has a nice weight to it, and the lift off is about as good as it gets, leagues better than I've ever felt. I played a few rounds of modern warfare with it and it instantly improved my game. The dedicated lift off sensor is not a gimmick, making large sweeping movements while running a high DPI possible. Also the DPI switch is in the perfect spot... easy to hit, but impossible to unintentionally hit. With the Logi I was hitting their dpi switch by accident almost every time I got into a firefight. The 1+2 mouse buttons are really nice, requiring some force to hit and delivering a positive actuation feel. They can take the weight of my finger without firing as a result, which is great. With the Logitech I used to have accidental discharges all the time because the buttons were so sensitive just the weight of my finger would fire them off. There are three thumb buttons, which is great, with the third being keyed 90 from the other two and slightly out of reach so you have to shift grip to hit it. This is great, and I'm still thinking of what I could bind to that. Aside from that, this mouse feels like it has zero gimmicks and it 100% designed to be a highly functional straight up gaming mouse.",
          "The Rival 650 Wireless Edition is by far the greatest mouse I have ever picked up. Starting with the build design and aesthetics, it is very nice to look at. With that being said, the RGB is just fine as well, adds a really nice touch but I am more focused on the performance of the mouse. I purchased this mouse to complete my laptop gaming setup that has just now become that much more portable and easy to setup. I paired this device with my Razer Blade 15 and it was an immediate plug and play, I took the USB dongle and I was ready to go right out the gate. It even came with a full-charged battery, which was very nice of them!For the grip, I always have used claw grip; with a hand size of around 7.2 inches from finger tip to palm, this mouse is just perfect for me. Anybody with larger hands will surely enjoy this product if that's what they're searching for. The grip is just fabulous, from the silicone side panels to the slip resistant tops of mouse1 and mouse2, this is just so comfortable to use for longer periods of time. I am glad that I chose this mouse over the Logitech G Pro Wireless. The Logitech G Pro was just too light and small for me to feel like I was in control. This mouse is similar to a Razer Deathadder if it were wireless, which is my favorite mouse of all time. However, I can see that view changing as I use the Steelseries Rival 650 more often.When it comes to price point, I picked this up for just $83.99 brand new on Black Friday and could not be happier. At this price point, especially when discounted, it is a luxury grade wireless mouse for the price of your average top-tier gaming mice. In my opinion, it surpasses the previous mice that I have used all while cutting the cord! I have a free range of motion and do not even have to think about where the cord restricts me, gaming on a laptop. This is the most impressive thing of all, that the sensor is this accurate and so easy to use, it feels just as good to use during gaming sessions as the top-tier mice on the market.I hope that I have done a good job documenting what is on the packaging and more importantly, what is inside the box. Hope this helped you guys who are considering making the jump to wireless. I was looking through the market for a while waiting to jump on the wireless mouse train, but hesitant to spend the hefty price of around $80-120. But in the end, I believe it was worth it and recommend those who have larger hands looking to find the wireless mouse build just for them (As long as you're right handed, lol.) In conclusion, it's perfect for the laptop gamer like myself that wants a powerful and efficient gaming setup that you can put anywhere.I will put a quick little list of pros and cons about this mouse below.Pros:WirelessHeavier - More control at higher DPIEffortless SetupQuick Charging (Just as Advertised)Sleek DesignSatisfying ClicksProgrammable Buttons! (+5 Excluding M1 + M2)Cons:Takes an unusual amount of time to wakeupHeavy, starting at 121g (For some this is a con)Liftoff is very sensitive, searching for any dip or bump in your pad - becomes shaky, however, I do not notice this in game; only when screwing around with the sensor on desktop",
          "The mouse is okay, but its expensive for a mouse. Not really worth the premium cost. Side buttons are super soft not tactile at all.Edit - 2/4/2023I've had this mouse for sometime now and it has held up alright. The software/firmware is now my biggest issue. When switching between wireless and wired for charging it will take way too long to detect the usb cable. I have to take it out and plug it back in multiple times for it to work, then I will get an alert to restart my computer to finish setting up the device. I've tried that, I've tried reinstalling. I've tried contacting their support for help. Nothing makes any difference on making it detect normally. I've kept it this long because I do enjoy having a wireless mouse but it seems to be getting worse and worse about it. Along with the fact the cable is not USB-C and has a weird plug housing so I am forced to keep a cable specifically for this mouse at the desk - it is getting close for me to ditch it for something better. If you are looking at this mouse in 2023 or later definitely skip it.",
          "The mouse double clicks, as it wasn't in the description of the item besides being used, item works well and came in very good condition.",
          "I really love the mouse, the steel series software is pretty lightweight and doesn't cause any drain on my computer. I really am enjoying the RGB coloring and customization. I personally prefer heavier mice so I use the already heavy mouse with all of the additional weights and it feels great in the hand. It tracks very smoothly and I don't notice any lag at all when using it wireless vs wired. One complaint is that the mouse is a bit big if you have smaller hands, my SO has tried it out and isn't a super big fan of how large it is since she has smaller hands.The battery life is the only thing that I wish was better about this mouse. I went from having a mouse that I could dock to charge so I'm noticing that I have to pay more attention to charging it when it's not in use. Not a huge deal if you just plug it in when you step away from your computer but if that's something that will bother you just be aware.",
          "I would like to start off by saying this is an extremely nice mouse, it has really good tracking, a really nice shape, and a really nice design, I feel like it ticks all the boxes for a good mouse, while yes, it is a heavier mouse, with the current meta of extremely light mouse in gaming taking off, I just don't see myself enjoying a light mouse, that's my personal preference and I feel like there is a group of people who feel the same. This is in my opnion the best mouse in this category.However, it has a problem I have noticed, the mouse has a rubberised matterial that is put on some places in its sides, specifically on the front left side of it, this material comes off easily, it's put in the areas your finger usually grip the mouse from, and they do provide nice grip, but the area on the top left of the mouse just comes off too easy, and is extremely hard to stick back in.",
          "I purchased this mouse to complement my MSI  Raider RGB laptop. The laptop comes with a Steel Series keyboard that lights up, as well as lights on the cover of the laptop that can be configured using the Steel Series Engine software.The mouse itself feels very good in my hand. It's comfortable and has plenty of buttons and feels solid. I played around with a Logitech 905 wireless mouse at a local store, and it felt flimsy by comparison. The accuracy of the mouse is a noticeable upgrade from my Logitech m505 that I was using until this mouse arrived.Having said that, this mouse is really the only choice if you already have a Steel Series keyboard or display or, as in my case, Steel Series hardware built into your laptop. The Steel Series Engine comes with an app that can be used to coordinate the lights for each device so they all match. It definitely impressed my friends and coworkers at the office.  You can also customize the lights with different patterns in the software, or turn it off if you want to conserve battery life.The mouse charges to full in no time at all and lasts a good little while. I used it for a marathon session this evening, playing League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and I even got some work done.Overall this is a terrific mouse by itself, but if you already have Steel Series hardware like a keyboard, this is almost your only logical choice if you are shopping for a mouse.",
          "[Update] Wow do i feel like an idiot.. My original review i gave this 3 stars because i thought the mouse was deffective and not charging... Turns out i hadn't plugged in the usb all the way \ud83d\ude02After a month of using this i really do like the mouse. It is a bit pricey but it has great battery life, great grip, and cool lighting features.The buttons now I've gotton used too i think when i wrote my original review i was just letting my OCD get the better of me.If u like wireless opt for this mouse. If u dont mind having the cable at all times then the wired version is for you and its a bit cheaper.I got to say that i am a little disappointed in this mouse considering how expensive it is.First off my mouse was defective out of the box. It was not working when plugged in via the usb cable nor would it charge. the steelseries engine didn't even recognize it as being plugged in. The only work around was to use it wirelessly but whats the point in having a wireless mouse if you can't charge it?So why am i rating it 3 stars out of 5? Well check this out, i had both the defective mouse and replacement mouse sitting next to each other and i noticed that the buttons don't even feel the same! the clicky-ness of the old mouse was far superior to the new replacement i was sent. The LMB feels so much sturdier as opposed to spongy like on my replacement.But im done sending it back in to be replaced. This one works as intended even if the mouse buttons aren't as great as the old broken mouse i had originally received..But to have the quality vary this much on a $100 mouse is truly disappointing. I can only imagine how this mouse will hold up in a couple months. probably not well.I recommend you guys go with Logitech unless you want to gamble and see how your mouse turns out. maybe it will work right out of the box and maybe your mouse buttons will be the good ones too!",
          "This is a great gaming mouse and should serve anyone fine, under ONE caveat: you can handle the weight of the mouse. It's roughly 120g; on the flipside, my Prime+ mouse from SteelSeries is 80g. I like the shape and the button options so it's all around good mouse but be sure you're ready for that weight.",
          "In the last few years, I have used a number of wireless mice. Wires are an inconvenience. A brand that shall go nameless had some good wireless mice, but all the ones I owned died unfortunate deaths due to heavy use.My palms are large, with somewhat stubby fingers. The mouse is fairly comfortable for my hands. I do notice a little bit of muscle fatigue after 4 or so hours, but most users will not be using it that long in a single session.Battery life is very long. I consistently use this mouse for long periods of time without plugging it in. However, I have noticed that in my time with this mouse the battery seems to have degraded. It still charges quickly and seems to last a while, but it isn\u2019t as impressive as it used to be.Another failing of this mouse is software. SteelSeries Engine, the software that is used to control this mouse, is limited in odd ways. As far as I can tell, I would need to make additional profiles to be able to make more sensitivity settings. This is a problem. I often want to switch between low and high sensitivities, based on in-game situations. If I need to quickly look around, I need high sensitivity. If I need to aim at something far away, I need low sensitivity. Normal gameplay is medium sensitivity. I need a minimum of three sensitivity settings to be effective.Overall, this is a good mouse. With changes to Engine it could be a great mouse. I already know the changes are possible because their competitors do it.Edit 7/24/2021: I am removing 3 stars due to the rubber panel adhesive. This is a $120 mouse. Why would you use garbage adhesive on the rubber side panels? Could it be to get another $10 out of your customers when the panels fall off, SteelSeries? Yes I\u2019ve seen those side panel replacements on your website. I will soon be replacing this mouse with a more expensive but more durable option from a different company. SteelSeries is no longer a good option.",
          "It feels great, looks great, and overall is great. Love the lighting customization with the software. The battery is pretty good and doesn't take long at all to charge back up. The side buttons feel nice too. The weight feels pretty good to me but that's a preference. Overall though it's a good mouse (for gaming) unless you just want a badass looking mouse with cool lights on it go for it.",
          "The Logitech G502 is an objectively better mouse, but this has a better RGB layout and I'm buying it purely for aesthetics. As a mouse it's perfectly usable.",
          "It\u2019s a great mouse. Not much to say but it does everything pretty good. I love steelseries and everything they make. The only problem is that I feel like the battery is always kinda running out. But maybe that\u2019s just me.",
          "Pros:- Fits well in my hand.- Responsive.- Can be used wirelessly or as a wired mouse- not too heavy and not too light- if the mouse runs out of battery you can use it as a wired mouse while it chargesCons:- Battery life lasts just a day with light effects turned on. I turned all the lights off except the scroll wheel (which shows battery status) and now it lasts about 3 or 4 days- uses micro-usb instead of USB-c- the stickers on the side (rubberized grip) seem like they will come off easily and can be annoying at timesSteelseries shuts off their mice when not in use to save battery and to \"activate\" the mouse again you have to click a button. I wish they would activate it when the mouse sense motion(or make it configurable)  This is the biggest annoyance in their mice.",
          "If you like to keep flashy colors running on your wireless mouse, to keep it matching the rgb on the rest of your rig, then you'll be spending a lot of time on the wire. I don't know why, but I never seem to get ten minute charge times that last ten hours, or whatever they advertise. That said, once charged even with the flashy lights kicking, I can still get a gaming session that last hours upon hours with it.The mouse glides really smooth, unlike any other mouse I've had the past 20 years. It feels good, and the dpi switch helps if you feel like you need two sensitivities for more than one activity, like gaming for instance.The buttons click reliably and easily with little pressure, making this a great operating mouse. The mouse wheel only scrolls and clicks, no side to side, which helps. It doesn't feel loose and wiggly, it's firm and the click is straight forward and reassuring, unlike even some other high end mice.The mouse looks awesome, feels great, and has the option to add weight, if that is your thing. For me, I use it without the weights, and it feels awesome.Like one other reviewer mentioned, the rubber on the right side where your third finger holds the mouse starts to curl up. They should have made the two rubber grip pads on big pad on the right side to prevent this rubber lifting. I don't know if super glue will fix that, but as a serious gamer, this can be a HUGE problem, hence the four stars.The mouse fits great in my semi-large hands. My sons with smaller hands don't like how far back the rear hump of the mouse reaches. This prevents precise finger movements for aiming if there isn't room in your hand for the mouse to move around. A smaller back is ALWAYS better for gaming mice. For me it's no issue, but may be for some.The mouse you use can be very subjective, like the issue in the last paragraph. If your mouse is a big decision for you, I'd suggest trying some out at a local retailer, so you know what feels best for you.The mouse is precise and smooth, and it looks cool. I'd buy it again for sure.",
          "It's been 4 to 5 months since I have been using this mouse. This mouse was ok. It was pretty stable, quick, and had adjustable weights. The battery life is not great, largely due to the RGB.I would give it a better review, but the rubber pads on the side of the mouse have essentially started to come off. What makes this worse, is that the glue that keeps the pads on has turned into a kind of sticky goo which the pad sort of slides around on making the mouse kind of gross. Honestly, it would have been better if they just not put the pads on the mouse in the first place.For as expensive as this mouse is, it is not worth the price.",
          "What a stellar mouse.  Quality materials.  Sides are rubbery-ish, and doesn't slip.  The weights seem gimmicky, but I'm not a believer.  I started with all the weights, but it was damn heavy and difficult to pick up the mouse are readjust.  Took out all the weights, and it was pretty light.  Ended up using about 60% of the weight, and positioned them towards the front, because when I pick up the mouse, it leaves the back end a little lighter, which I like.  If you have never used a mouse with weights, it's a joy to play around with, and you'll spend the first hour or so tinkering with it.The software is easy to download and install.  For both window and mac.  That's important to me, because I have a 13\" macbook pro, and needed a mouse that was compatible.  Happy to report that this is mac compatible.After setting all my macros, and lights I noticed that the mouse would pause a bit, for a split second while using it.  It was unbearable, and I was pretty disappointed because I thought I was going to have to return it.  Did some googling and figured out that others were having the same issue.  One person suggested to download the latest firmware, and viola.  That did the trick.  I figured the download on the page, was the latest firmware.  But alas, it is not.Great mouse.  A little more than I wanted to spend on a mouse, but considering that I use it everytime I use my computer, I guess spending the extra $30 or so dollars, is worth it.Great buy.",
          "Great wireless mouse, had to return it tho. A bit to heavy, I'm not that guy who would care about that, but it is and feels it. Love the feel, shape etc, just a bit to heavy.  Really wanted to like it, as Steelseries makes the best keyboard I've ever used in the apex pro.",
          "Awesome product, I always love steel series products. The customization is awesome, but after a while it can get a little uncomfortable to use.",
          "The mouse is great, but for whatever reason I have to constantly uninstall/reinstall the steelseries software to actually get this to work wirelessly. Browse the internet and you'll see this is a more common problem then it should be. Once it stops working wirelessly I followed all the stupid guides had the mouse and dongle both connected it will \"update\" firmware and finish then will say it didn't work it's a vicious cycle of it \"updating\" and never working sadly the un/reinstall is only thing that fixes it for me. I love steel series I had no issues with the prime model and wireless, but this model there's an obvious issue, and obviously they don't have a fix on their end.",
          "Bueno",
          "I'll get to cons, but this mouse gets 5 stars for 10/10 sensors, perfect wireless, and probably the coolest lighting on a mouse out there. This is a large heavy mouse, even without adding any of its weights, and this is perfect for me, but possibly not everyone. There is no benefit to heavy/large over light/small, it is entirely personal preference.Some cons:-Battery life worse than competitors, but you still aren't going to be running out of juice even with the lighting turned up but if you forget to plug it in when you go to bed you may be limited in the morning. The mouse works just find plugged in too, so really it's a little con.-Third side mouse button feels light years away from my thumb even though I have large hands. If you don't have large hands I imagine it will be especially bad because even I have to shift my grip to reach it. Other two are perfectly placed.-It could use a grippier coating around the outside to make gripping and picking up easier. I upgraded from a Rival 300 and that had a nice grippy siding, althout it did wear down.-Weight seems to heavily lean towards the back. That means during pickups if you don't have a strong grip you might find you're dragging the back of it along while you pick up. This does not make pickups less accurate as the sensor still knows very well that you lifted. This hasn't actually bothered me, I almost like the resistance it gives when picking up, but it seems like this was something they settled on for some design reason and not the way that they would actually want it to balance.Overall, worth the price just to get these sensors with wireless and pretty lights (which you care about, don't lie to yourself).",

          "So I've had this mouse for a few days now and I'm really enjoying it. I've been using a Razer Naga since they came out. A few years back my last good naga, the 2014 model shot craps. I went and immediately bought a trinity since I'm an mmo player and need a 12 button layout. It barely lasted, my replacement didn't last, and even the replacement I bought while waiting die a replacement crapped out. So I've been using the more expensive naga wireless and I have to use it wired because it doesn't stay connected. When I saw this, I ordered without question. Didn't even look at the price. Mouse runs flawlessly. It's super lightweight, stays connected, and has great battery life. It's comfortable in the and and it's laid out well. My only minor gripe is the side buttons are caved in slightly which feels awkward but I'm getting used to it. Overall I recommend this mouse and I believe it warrants the premium price.",
          "Cool mouse",
          "After about a month of use, I can confirm this mouse is legit except for the battery life that lasts only about 40 hours of heavy MMO use in 2.4Hz connection without RGB. If RGB is turned on, I think this mouse will last only about 12 hours. I\u2019ve had one other MMO mouse before, G600, and I like the Aerox 9 a lot more though G600 had angled buttons to allow users to find the buttons easier in the beginning. Side button positions and layout is just as good on both mouse. It\u2019s about the same difficulty of pushing side buttons. In the most comfortable grip, my thumb finds 4-9 naturally, but 1-3 and 10-12 is not a problem to push. Since Aerox 9 is much lighter than the G600 and has no cable connection, it is easier to maneuver in my hand and find those 1-3 and 10-12. The mouse also is not humongous like some people make it out to be. I am 5ft 9 and have a fair sized hand. My hand is definitely not big for my size. When I put the mouse under my hand in natural comfortable grip, I have a small wiggle room between my wrist and the end tail of the mouse. I don't play game in this comfy grip tho. I put my wrist as close to the tip of the mouse tail so thumb is close to side button 1,2,3 as it allows moving the mouse around more accurately. However, like I said, the mouse is so light, it is easy to tilt/move inside my hand so finding numbers 7-12 isn't a problem. The click sensation is very nice and there is no latency issue at all. Zero.The real problem of this mouse is the Steelseries Engine software and the customer service. One time, I asked a few questions to the company and it took them 10+ days to reply. The DPI adjustment is only available in 100 increment. A 50 increment up and down would have made a world of difference for me, but the software can only do 100 plus or minus, so fine tuning is not the best. The mouse also does not go back to normal button configuration setup once you engage a game connected to the Engine software. If you start a game bind to the custom button configuration via Engine, the button configuration will stay in a game setup even after the PC turned off and turned back on. I had to open the Engine software to go back to my normal web browser button setup.One tip. Get a  magnetic USB-C connector + cable for charging. It\u2019s much easier to connect the charger that way. The charging port is positioned a little hard to connect, but with magnetic dongle and cable snaps right in.",
          "I bought this mouse around 6 months ago, I loved it but after only few months I experienced an issue with the scroll wheel, its less clicky and it jumps up and down randomly when you scroll. This is not acceptable to wear in this short period.",
          "This mouse is a wonderful addition to any MMO player's gear/setup.  If you are used to using MMO mouses, the ergonomic design of the side buttons may take a few days to a week to get use to, but once you do, your game experience will feel buttery smooth.",
          "It's super light, feels great, the included cables/accessories are excellent, and functions like it should. I prefer the acceleration/accuracy of Razer mice but that's a preference and not a knock against it. The only complaint I have is I would prefer if the numpad was just a little farther towards the back. I have big hands, but I've had to adjust my grip, otherwise I'm always one row farther back than I should be.In terms of feel, I really like how light it is. My Naga Pro is very heavy, so lifting it up off the mousepad means either accidentally pressing one of the side buttons, or compensating with your pinky, which doesn't feel good. The side buttons on this are a LITTLE harder to press than the Naga, so combined with the lightness, it feels easy to pick up and adjust as you use it. The buttons aren't as clicky as Reddragon or even the Naga, but they're not as squishy as Corsair's MMO mouse (which just feels downright cheap to me).Overall, good mouse. Just takes some adjustment in your grip. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good buy.",
          "6 4 and big hands, long fingers. Thought I'd be fine reaching the top row when so many have said you can't reach it.Nope - they're right. Love the fit of the mouse. It's like an EC1 with buttons on the side. Fits (palms) great and your thumb is right there to reach all the buttons...except the top three. And to reach the top three you have to go claw grip and adjust your hold on the side - all while trying to get your ability off in your MMO without messing up.Not going to work.",
          "Takes a little getting used to because I have fat fingers but I love it",
          "I have very large hands, and while the side mouse buttons weren't actually a problem for me like other reviewers have said, the way the mouse bends causes my fingers to cramp very badly. My other mice don't have this problem, and for the time being I'm swapping back to my old mouse. Shame for how much the mouse itself costs",
          "I was looking for an alternative to the Razer Naga, as I just started playing WoW again. I already have a SteelSeries Rival 3 and keyboard and was pleased to find this offering. Feels great, comfortable, and as familiar as my Naga used to be. Great to use wired too when needing to charge about once a week if that.",
          "Got this mouse today and used it for about 30 minutes. Refund is already initiated and I'm dropping it back in the mail tomorrow.I've been longing for a lightweight ambidextrous body style MMO mouse for a long time.  I honestly thought this might be the one, unfortunately it's not even close.It's pretty sharp looking, but for me that's about where it stops.Here's a list of the Pro's and Cons:CONS:1. The exterior of the mouse is matte, so if you have dry hands be prepared for this mouse to hardly have any grip while trying to reach for the awkwardly placed side buttons, especially if you pick the mouse up regularly while gaming because it's actually more ergonomic like the Razer Death Adder and a lot less like Glorious Model-O even thought it looks like it.  I'm not sure why these hardware companies seemingly don't test their own products, but the button placement on this mouse is just annoying when it really didn't have to be.2. The left and right mouse buttons on the top are so sensitive that just lifting the mouse and setting it down triggers them, and if you're turning the mouse to reach side buttons you accidentally press them on accident a lot.3. There's no extra buttons on top of the mouse other than the one DPI switch which feel like a huge missed opportunity, especially for the price.4. The one I got today, the left mouse button clicked twice upon decompression making a single mouse click feel crunchy and like a double click.5. The sensor even after the firmware update and installing the software engine felt mediocre.  It would go from 900dpi to what would feel like 400dpi mid swipe trying to fight and move in game. This only happened in wireless mode and I believe it was from the mouse slightly tilting and lifting the sensor due to its design.6. Way overpriced for what you actually get.Pro's1. It's wireless if that's important to you.2. I'm getting a full refund.This mouse doesn't even feel much lighter than the other MMO mice I have. Unless you're a Razer Death Adder or a Naga fan save yourself some time and money and go with something else.  I haven't found anything that fits my hand as well as my Redragon Impact M908 with the weights out.",
          "Mouse stopped working wireless after 5 months. Won't connect with dongle. Whole reason bought a wireless mouse was to not have to play while plugged in and now it's the only way I can use it.",
          "Mouse needs to be charged almost daily it feels like.I have the steel series engine software installed and notice that a single day of work and MMO playing drains about 75 - 80% of the battery.Kind of unacceptable considering a pair of double a batteries lasts months in a mouse for work.I charged the mouse yesterday evening and as of 9:17AM (I've been working for 3 hours) the mouse is down to 65% already.For a premium gaming mouse, the battery life sure is trash.",
          "This mouse is great a little too big for my hands, but it is accurate and smooth.I loved the 650 model, but needed more buttons so I bought this one. For me this mouse would absolutely be perfect if it was as heavy as the 650 model or heavier and have 9 buttons on the side instead of 12.I gave 5 stars because this mouse is as advertise does what it is suppose to do.I feel like a heavier mouse is more accurate for me if I need it to move faster I can just increase the sensitivity, my hand twitches sometimes so with the lighter mouse it'll move my position, but with a heavier mouse it will not move enough were I can't recover quickly.",
          "Overall a great mouse for people with a larger hand. Only complaint is that button 5 has already stopped working after less than a year of owning it.",
          "update: 2/23 - I've now had this replaced 3 different times by the manufacturer. The first one the battery didn't hold a charge, the second one lost signal constantly, and the third one the scroll wheel stopped working after only 5-6 months. The quality control of this company is beyond terrible. The only thing I can say is at least they replace the thing and don't charge you shipping.update: 8/21 - still lucky if the thing lasts 12 hours on a charge. Regularly disconnects itself and won't re-establish a connection to the wifi dongle. Obviously way outside my return window. Only keep using it because I have no other option and paying another $140 for a mouse is outside my means atm.update: 7/21 - Lucky if the thing lasts 12 hours worth of charge. I have the wireless receiver literally 6\" from the mouse and it still randomly just stops working until I turn the mouse off and on.This thing is even worse than I thought. It's sad because it's decent otherwise as far as feel and software goes.update: 6/18 - this thing goes maybe 18 hours on a charge. MAYBE. I've let it charge for upwards of 24hr and even then It doesn't last a total of 18hrs. It just starts disconnecting and having issues. It does this on the bluetooth or wireless mode. Going to have to change my review to 1 star and say AVOID AT ALL COSTS.I have a corsair scimitar I've had for quite a while that I use for a lot of different games. Figured I'd try a different brand and see how it felt.First, gaming mice are like underwear. Everyone has a different fit/preferance. This mouse is MUCH lighter than my corsair. I like that as it's easier to pick up and reposition if needed. Tracking seems good. Glides nicely.The software is not exactly super user friendly as far as I'm concerned. Still better than the mess that is ICUE however. I've had a couple times it's gone non-responsive so far, but I'm not sure if the blame is with the mouse or my motherboard as I've have a couple USB issues previouslyButton placement (for my hand) means I have to stretch a bit to get the first column of buttons. In contrast with the corsair where I have to stretch to get the back column. So far I'm still adjusting to it, but I seem to like it pretty well.",
          "I wanted a wireless G600 or Naga but didn't want to pay the price for one. When this went on sale for $90USD I bought it. The quality is good and the RGB looks nice. The mouse is fairly light and move smoothly.The big issue is how long it is. I have a 'normal' sized hand for dude and usually hold my mouse with a claw grip. This mouse is still too long for my hand. I have to hold it almost 45 degrees pointed left to use the side buttons effectively. Said buttons also lack the different angles that yell your thumb which row you're on. After 2 months I'm still hitting the wrong keys from time to time.TLDR: decent mouse if you have large hands.",
          "So I bought this mouse because I wanted a wireless mouse with the MMO buttons on it and didn\u2019t want to pay the price for razer. So I thought I\u2019d try this one out. So far I\u2019ve had it a little over 2 or 3 weeks and I love it. It\u2019s super light and comfy. My only issue with it is the battery life but I do use it 10 hours a day for work and gaming and it still drains power if it\u2019s not turned off. Aside from that I have to charge it every like 2 or 3 days. It\u2019s my first steel series mouse but I love it.",
          "TL;DR = The side buttons are extremely stiff but the product itself feels really nice. Lightweight, good battery life, mild RGB, great tracking and probably more suitable for FPS than other MMO mice. Solid first attempt mmo mouse from steel series but would wait for a sale.Full backstory on why I wanted this product and unfiltered thoughts below.As someone who has been using MMO mice ever since I picked up the first razer naga back whenever that came out, I have been incorporating 12 buttons on the side into my gaming experiences. I absolutely love this design, but was quite devastated with the lack of options in the market today. To finish out my journey, after I had to decommision my old razer naga after years of service (The physical materials gave out before the switches failed), I moved to redragon mouse which I later traded to a friend who had a naga 2014 he didn't like (which was a bad move as the naga 2014 had horrid tracking issues), next I saved for a naga trinity which was fine despite not wanting the other side panels, and then the left clicker started wearing down less then 2 years in, which replicated in all the people I knew who also had the mouse in even less time. I lastly bought a naga X feeling kind of bummed after 2 bad buys, to have the double clicking issue again pop up in that mouse only 7 months in. Convinced Razer's ability to make a well designed product has left them, I was ecstatic to see a steelseries MMO mouse enter the market.Onto the actual review of this product, I primarily have been playing FF14 and utilize all the side buttons to click my abilities in a very quick fashion. I do endgame raiding so need to be fast and accurate with my button presses. I haven't tried to raid yet with this mouse, but my first impressions are that it is going to require some adjusting to get used to. The side buttons are way stiffer than any other MMO mouse I have tried so far, and quite a bit longer meaning I will have to slide my already large hands up and down a little bit to accurately reach from the top to bottom rows. If I wasn't trying to actively press them quickly, its very comfortable to hold without that, and might be really nice for when I move over to FPS games or general browsing. For my use case however I am slightly concerned.My next observance is the honeycomb design, this is my first time owning a mouse that is just open like this one. You can directly see the PCB through the open shell. I don't know what this speaks of for long term use, but sometimes I do get sweaty hands as many MMO sessions can carry on a for quite a bit. I don't think it will lead to anything, but just leaving it out there as a mild concern.The rest of the mouse feels fairly well designed. The clickers don't feel to bad, the multi connectivity is something I have missed since my original 2 nagas, and bluetooth while I haven't tried it seems like a nice touch as well. You will need a type C port to use the 2.4ghz dongle, and it does kind of latch into the slot and requires a bit of force to remove (I struggled a bit to get it out of my laptop). The battery life feels pretty good and it comes with a type C cable for charging or wired connectivity (saddly no charging dock here).The sensor in the mouse is a proprietary one that steelseries owns, and I have to say its quite awesome. I really like using the mouse with my laptop in bed, as I have had accurate tracking on all of the surfaces I have tried. Compared to some of the other wireless mice I have used like the logitech g502, this thing is a godsend for wanting to laze about comfortable. The mouse is also VERY light, but has a nice center of gravity so its easy to control in your hand. This does feel like a premium peripheral.Bottom line, I do like this mouse. I had mentioned in my review of their APEX keyboard that I wished they had made a MMO mouse so that when I try to fully integrate into their ecosystem I would actually have a mouse. Felt like fate that not long after this mouse came out. Time will tell if I can actually gain full efficiency with the buttons on the side as I think they just need a little more refinement to be perfect, and it ended up being more of an add on to an already well designed regular mouse, than designed with them from the ground up. While the premium feel is very nice, I don't think this is a 150$ mouse, I got mine on the first sale where it dropped to 90$ which is closer to what I would recommend it at.So if you are like me and can't stand the defect rate from Razer products anymore, and are able to shill out a bit more to try a new imperfect yet fairly nice device then go for it. If not, and want to wait to see how it holds up then Redragon and Utech are pretty good cheap brands, if you are into modding I heard the logitech one is easy to upgrade, and Corsairs is quite popular as well. Will update if this mouse has any other glaring issues or if my daily driving yields good fruits.",
          "I haven\u2019t used it for long, so I can\u2019t say anything about long-term use, but for now... it\u2019s the best deal I had this year.I bought a used one, and it was bricked. Someone messed up the firmware update and returned it to amazon, and I got lucky, returned it, and a few weeks later, I tried my luck again, buying this for $37. WHAT A STEAL!!I did the firmware update, and it runs great! Brand new mice for an unbeatable price.I have the Aerox 5 wireless and a few other mice from SteelSeries and Razer, but this one takes the win. It fits a claw grip much better than my Naga trinity, weighs a lot less, and the battery life is excellent( it depends on how bright the lights are.. set to 50% brightness and use smart light mode, and it lasts forever). I LOVE IT!",
          "I have used every gen of naga and the g600,g604.  This is better hands down.  Extremely comfortable shape.  It took some getting used to but honestly I was performing the same within an hour of using it.  The buttons require a little force but this is a positive in my opinion because it prevents accidental clicks.Note that this mouse is very large.  I have large hands so this works for me, but I think those with small hands would struggle.  Maybe see if you can find one on display at best buy to test",
          "As far as 12 key mice, this mouse is superb. Great battery life, lightweight, software is fairly easy to use and customize the mouse. The holes in the case of the mouse are concerning for cleaning. Don't see any screws that allow you to open it up, but the holes are big enough for a compressed air straw. The shape of the mouse doesn't allow you to pick up the mouse easily without pressing any buttons. But I have waited a long time for this mouse. Had a Razer Naga, but back then I hard wired it to my PC while charging. I now use my mice wireless and charge them from a nearby wall socket. Since I got that mouse for WoW way back when, I haven't found a 12 key mouse that was wireless and worked while charging from a wall socket as opposed to plugging it into a PC and wasn't a piece of garbage *cough utech/reddragon cough*. This mouse does that, however it's finicky. It will work on wireless 2.4ghz while plugged in, but when it goes to sleep, it can no longer work with 2.4ghz. However, bluetooth works while charging, but for some reason it forgets all the keybinds and uses some weird keybinds, not the standard 0-9, -, +. The software has a Bluetooth config button, but for some reason it doesn't seem to work. Battery life is much better than the Naga and it's lighter. The tactile feeling of the buttons might make it harder to get used to a 12 key mouse, but I have a lot of experience with them, so it's not that hard. Many 12 key mice has beveled edges that make it more obvious where each key is. The lip that indicates the middle of the 12 keys (the 5 key) is not too pronounced. When it goes to sleep on 2.4ghz, it has a chance to try to connect forever. It blinks white which it does when it's connecting to a device and never stops. To fix it, you simply turn it off and turn it back on. Bluetooth usually wakes up just fine. I just got used to having to restart the mouse. It's very unlikely that this would affect me while I'm playing a game, so it's not a huge deal. I saw a review that it's too long for an average hand size. That's probably true. I'm 6'3\" and the mouse is just the right size to rest while my hand is comfortably arched around it.",
          "Cons:Battery life is garbageErgonomically, the side buttons are a nuisance and for someone loke me have no need for so many buttonsSometimes looses connection when using 2 4ghz. Very aggravating when in a gamePros:Cpi is easy to use and very accessibleEasy to connect and useAdditional note. The GG software ALWAYS shows the mouse at 95 percent charged. Also, if you use the GG software be prepared to disable your VPN in order to log into your account",
          "This mouse annoys me. It works super well, but the button layout on the side while the same, is positioned different than other mmo mouses, and borderline uncomfortable to hit the top 1-3 buttons. That's what annoys me. I want to give this a raving review, but I can't because it's barely used for its intended purpose.",
          "Pretty much the title. The button rows are about half an inch too long I find myself straining to reach the top row (1, 2, and 3) even with a palm grim on the mouse. It claims to be great for MOBA and maybe that is the case, but it is not good for MMOs like WoW and FFXIV.",
          "I have been trying for a decade to get away from Razer. I can't stand them, but I can't go back to not having an \"MMO\" mouse. The buttons are useful for all manner of games. I was really excited to try the Aerox 9, having been impressed with Steelseries' Apex Pro keyboard. I'm sorry to say this thing is awful.The biggest problem here is that the mouse both expects you to have very light, small hands, and very large, freakishly long thumbs.The main attraction of an MMO mouse is the side buttons. I have fairly large hands, at about 8 1/2 inches from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger, and about a 9 inch wingspan. Unless you're an NBA player, good luck reaching those keys. The side buttons are so far toward the front of the mouse, and add some ridiculous staggered angle, I cannot comfortably reach the 1, 2, 3, or 6 buttons. They're so hard to reach, I have to shift my grip to get at them. Palm and claw don't work. I can't reach the buttons in palm. When I do claw, I invariably add more weight on my index finger. That's when the second major problem shows up.The actuation force on the clicks is absurdly low. This trend in recent years to reduce actuation force / distance is really, really stupid. Speed switches on keyboards, with ~1.2mm actuation, as opposed to the standard 2mm, have shown to have ZERO improvements in actuation speed. It's a gimmick that makes you bad at typing. It seems we're doing this with mice now, too. If you so much as look at the mouse funny, it will click. Unless you have baby hands, you can't rest your finger on the button at all. Having a neurological condition that causes me to shake, I have no choice. My large hands, not large enough to reach the side buttons, are also too large to comfortably use the mouse as a mouse. Lovely.I measured the actuation force of the click at the tip of the button at around 30g. I'm using a scale, so it's not as accurate as a proper force gauge, but it got the job done. My Naga Pro actuated at 45g at the tip. The thing is, with the Naga, I don't have to rest my finger on the end of the button. Not only is it 50% more required force, but I can rest closer to the axis, which means my 70-80g force of a resting finger is less likely to actuate the click. The actuation force is fine when I palm grip, but again, I cannot do this AND use the side buttons, because this thing was designed by Salad Fingers.For perspective, Cherry Brown keyboard switches are 55g. Blue are 60g. Red, being a pretty light switch, is 45g. Keyboard switches are also usually not required to bear the weight of a finger unless you're actively pressing a key. The mouse has to. 30g is too low.Lastly, they replaced their old Engine software with this bloated GG thing. I didn't use it long enough to form an opinion on it, but lighter companion applications are almost universally better.Buy a Naga Pro if you're willing to spend this much. Buy a Logitech G600 if you want to spend 1/4 the money. Hell, I'd recommend a Corsair Scimitar over this thing, and the side buttons on that thing suck, too.Steelseries, you can fix this mouse by moving the buttons closer to the back, making them shorter in length for denser placement (see Naga), and stiffen up the click a bit. If you do that, you have a winner. Unfortunately, you designed the worst of both worlds.",
          "I was looking forward to this mouse seeing most companies don't really make newer or updated models for this gaming genre and I really like mmo mice even though I don't play too many mmos nowadays. I really  wanted to love this, but in the end I made this one of my backup mice if somehow forget to charge my Naga.Coming from using the scimitar, the naga, and the g600, overall the mouse is great as a mouse it works like how you expect. As for the mmo buttons the responsiveness of the buttons is a bit lacking, sometimes I feel I didn't press the button, pressing down it feels a bit mushy and not a clean keypress, and the positioning of the buttons has a bit of a learning curve with its elongated and different sized buttons.Battery life is good I wish there was a dock of some sort for me to leave it when I'm done with my gaming session rather than plugging it in. The RGB is rgb I don't really fiddle too much with this other than setting color profiles with my gaming profile loadouts.The corsair program needs a few more updates and integrations to compare to  other competitors program for button configuration, but overall serviceable.",
          "Update:  I've had the mouse for 4 days.  It keeps having issues staying connected to my computer. It either will start flashing white constantly (and the Engine software will say \"reconnect device\") or the Engine software will show it as connected however the cursor won't move. The flashing white issue randomly seems to resolve itself after a computer reboot (but not always the first reboot) and the connected-but-not-working issue requires the USBC dongle to be pried out of the computer and plugged back in. And do I mean pried. It does not come out easy. I tried using the mouse on Bluetooth to see if it would be more stable however everytime my computer goes idle/sleep it disconnects and won't auto-connect when the computer is woken up.  I have to use keyboard shortcuts to open Windows settings and \"forget device\" then repair it.  Also, for anyone else looking to use this on Bluetooth, a lot of the features are disabled while on BT connection. You are limited to default keybindings which are just 1-9, -, and = on the side.The battery life appears to be abysmal.  I don't know if its a side affect of the disconnect issue or what but in 4 days I've had to recharge the battery twice.  Yes, between work and gaming the mouse sees 12ish hours of use a day but that multiplied by 4 days is now here near the advertised 180 hours of use per charge.I have opened a ticket with SteelSeries support and will give them a few days to resolve this. If they can't back it goes and I'll get another Logitech G600 as my old mouse was reliable for several years before the multi-click issue started.Original Review:I'm a female gamer. I have small hands even for women. I have used Razr Naga (several iterations), the Microsoft MMO mouse, and the Logitech G600.  This is the only one that has felt too big for my hands. The mouse is so long that I enter have to play with my palm on the top of the mouse (which feels weird as heck) or hold like I'm used to but be unable to reach half the side buttons. Also my fingers fall on the mesh portion of the  mouse. I'm... still trying to decide if this will be a return or if I can adapt to holding it differently.  See the picture for reference to how my teeny hands are landing on this mouse.Outside of that obviously sexist design flaw (WOMEN ARE GAMERS TOO... C'mon Steel Series you're better than this) the mouse feels... cheap.  I think this is stemming from the lightweight plastic.  There is absolutely no weight to the mouse at all. This is again something I'm trying to decide if I can adapt to because it's so very different than the G600 which I've used for the last several years.I'll try to update this after I make my decision...",
          "The weight and glide are both really nice on the Aerox 9. I am coming from a G305, which I will probably keep using for FPS, but use the Aerox 9 for everything else. My only issue is that the side buttons took about a month to get used to. I use claw grip, so I accidentally clicked in the buttons every now and then. Now I'm using a combined claw-palm grip and all I need to do is keep getting comfortable with my thumb placement.",
          "Oh wow, this thing is a real hero, a true champion of hardware. My gripes were totally insignificant, but hey, who doesn't love a firmware update that magically fixes everything? I mean, it's not like we paid for a product that actually works properly out of the box, right?And let's not forget the super fun experience of having to take apart the scroll wheel because it decided to go hopscotching on us. I just love being a DIY expert, don't you? It's like we're all just one screwdriver away from being a tech support superhero.Update: Unfortunately, the software (SteelSeries GG) is like a bad ex who just can't seem to let go. Every time they update, they just have to break something else. It's like they're competing for the \"Worst Software Award\" or something. And don't even think about trying to disable auto-updates or roll back to a previous version. Nope, you're stuck with their hot mess of an update, whether you like it or not. Isn't that just grand?",
          "i got the aerox 9 to replace my logitech g600 mouse for ffxiv because i just really needed a more lightweight and comfortable mmo mouse since i have a lot of joint problems. i have very small hands but the button placements are still fine for my grip type i guess? i saw others who also have small hands say its a little too big if they have a claw grip, but i have more of a palm gripstyle. i\u2019m really disappointed in the battery life though. on a full charge, its only lasted me roughly 30ish hrs of playtime before i have to charge it again? even with the lights off since i dont really like the lights on draining battery since i also have wireless rgb headsets, i\u2019m just used to keeping rgb off on my stuff to get more battery life. not sure why it doesn\u2019t last longer than that, i\u2019ve tried it at full charge three times now and i dont seem to get much more than this but it could just be i got a dud battery in my mouse maybe. my razer viper lasts forever so that\u2019s what i compare it to for battery life on a wireless mouse. that doesn\u2019t actually bother me nearly as much though because i\u2019ve also had several connection issues with this mouse which is just strange. I\u2019ve had to forget and re-pair it almost every single time i connect it with bluetooth to my laptop, but even when i connect it via the receiver on my pc, i\u2019ve had to also re-pair the mouse to the receiver almost every time as well. it will connect, then disconnect seconds later and this pattern would just keep repeating until i just forget the device on my computers to reconnect them all over again. i thought maybe it was just an issue with my pc, but the same happens on my laptop as well and i dont understand why. its an annoying thing to do because even if i only use it in one mode with one computer, this still happens where i have to re-sync the mouse as if its a new device every single time. i am still gonna keep the mouse though because its been much more comfortable and easier on my joints to use, i just wish it would actually stay paired to my devices and maybe have more battery life. also a note unrelated to my rating, don\u2019t forget that if you have pets that shed a lot year round, the pet hair will get stuck in the holes in the honeycomb design lol its not something i remembered when i bought this mouse so just be mindful of it",
          "Ive been on a naga pro, Its started to fall apart so I ordered \"The new greatest mmo mouse\". *Enters aerox 9*I have a medium size hand.1-3 are a stretch to hit on the thumb pad. Thump pad feels misplaced for home/center.That can kinda be overlooked and learned.The scroll wheel though. SOOOOO pooorly designed.I play a lot of Eso and use the scroll left and right side buttons as bar swaps and Special abilities. The wheel itself is buried or recessed into the body of the mouse so far that its actually a struggle to side click. Probably the height of a nickel on its side. Combine that with its wheel round edges and you have the worst bar swapper in the history of mmo driven gear.  You can very easily brush over it.  If I cant nudge the wheel, someone with a larger hand also looking for this feature will be disappointed.I normally don't leave product reviews but this thing really disappointed.  Function should always go before form.I do like the software.I will try it for a bit but I think it will be returned for another naga thats also cheaper.",
          "The Aerox's button implementation is a bit disappointing but good enough to get the job done. It makes up for that by exceling at everything else.Compared to the Naga, I need to shift my grip more often to reach the side buttons. It took some getting used to, but it doesn't bother me anymore. This leaves something to be desired, but tbf most 12 button implementations I've used have some compromises.Identifying the side buttons comes down to muscle memory because there aren't obvious cues like the button texture or the angle of the buttons. The columns of buttons are slanted at an angle, which makes the farthest buttons easier to reach at the cost of being less intuitive. Most of the buttons have to be pecked, not the kind you can roll your thumb over.The maneuverability of the Aerox helps make the grip shifting less of an annoyance. At 90g it weighs 40g less than some of its peers. The lighter weight is actually really noticeable when juggling between mouse movement, side button presses, shifting grips to reach buttons, and lifting off the mouse without accidental presses. Some of these things feel really clunky and cumbersome on other mmo mice I've had.Overall I think it's an excellent wireless 12 button option. I don't mind shifting my grip more in exchange for a much more comfortable mouse with a reasonable weight.  Works great as a media mouse and glides good on the couch too.Pros- Good safe ergo shape and light weight. Huge improvement over last gen's clunky brick-like 12 button mmo mice.- Handles fps games without breaking a sweat. Flicking and lifting off without accidental presses isn't an issue at all.- Stellar next gen battery life.- Tilt scroll.- Wireless connection has been great so far.Cons- When palm gripping, more difficult to reach the farther buttons compared to peers.- Side buttons are not as easy to differentiate compared to peers.- Software gets the job done, but isn't as nice as peers",
          "I saw this for the first time the other day and waited for a sale... and initial impressions are fantastic. It's way lighter than I'm used to, so tracking will take a bit of getting used to. Bluetooth option is a major plus for when I travel. The button grid is a bit larger than the Naga, but useable... comparable to the Corsair but the buttons are easier to find with my thumb. The only real downside so far is that the plastic on the right side is slippery (not rubberized). It has been difficult to pick up, it likes to slip out of my hand when doing liftoff maneuvers. I ordered some grip tape to fix this, so I expect that will be a non-issue soon. As long as it doesn't suffer from tracking issues 6 months in like every Razer I've owned, I think this will be my #1 MMO mouse for the foreseeable future.For a bit of background.... I've been using MMO mice exclusively for my MMOs for the last decade or so. I've tried all the major brand MMO mice. Started with the Naga when that first came out. Tried the G600 and the Corsair one when those came out. Bought a lot of Nagas over the years(3 wired and 4 wireless), they all had tracking/skipping issues within about 6 months (as do all Razer mice I've tried). Eventually I would start swapping them I had so many. When one would act up I would grab a spare. That one would work again for a little bit and I would have to swap again. I had 5 different PCs/laptops I used over the years, so I knew it was a mouse issue and not my computer. Once they had started making wireless versions, I was stuck. When I tried the G600 for a bit, I had to go back to the Naga because the G600 is massive and hard to maneuver. The Corsair turned out to be an excellent option, but their software is awful and no wireless was a problem when I wanted to travel, so it stays with my desktop now. I'm honestly surprised we haven't had another wireless option sooner... I know this probably came out a while ago, but I also don't play MMOs as much as I used to... mostly just play FF14 casually these days.",
          "This mouse is huge. I have a naga pro and this thing is way bigger. The side buttons are too wide making the 12 buttons really stretch your thumb to get to all of the buttons. It\u2019s light weight which is a plus and feels pretty good for palm grip. I don\u2019t like the ring finger rest on the naga. If someone could just make a small mmo mouse with maybe 9 side buttons the size of an orochi v2, I would buy that mouse so quickly. I do like this aero but 1,2,3 are really hard to hit. If the buttons were a quarter of the width and maybe a little taller, it would be gold.",
          "The mouse constantly disconnects from bluetooth every 5 minutes or sometimes only 30-60 seconds, then has to be turned off & back on in order to reconnect.  I contacted Steelseries, they responded quickly with instructions on how to do a hard reset.  I did the reset several times and it had no effect.  I reached out again to Steelseries for what to do next and got no response.Thank goodness for Amazon being flexible with my return as I was 2 days past my return window.Thumb buttons are also a too far forward & stiff to use, but I could have lived with that. Someone who uses these buttons might be more put off by them.",
          "I've had this mouse for a few months now and I can confidently say that this is, by leagues, the worst mouse I have ever owned.I will list a few of my mice to give you an idea of what I've played with over the past few years. Nothing crazy.G9XG300G300sG502G502 HeroG602This mouse has been the worst mouse I have ever owned.. and probably the most expensive. It wasn't worth $50, certainly not $100.The battery life is hilarious.. I cannot make it through an 8-hour binge without having to charge it. If you try to combat this by using the built-in battery saver mode, your mouse takes 5 seconds to wake up. This will ruin games for you if you keep the battery saver timer low. I had it at 1 minute and it would freeze up while I was typing to teammates, causing me to die.Response rates are garbage. It's really, really bad. I don't know if it's a defective unit or if they're all this bad, but I feel like I am using my grandmother's ergonomic Chinese wholesale mouse sometimes.The programmable buttons are practically impossible to reach unless you've got some mutated inbred hands or something. If your thumb can reach those back buttons during normal play, call a priest.The dongle this mouse comes with is poor quality. It will constantly disconnect whenever it feels like it. You can combat this by finding a USB port that it just vibes with for no discernable reason. Out of like 9 ports on my desktop, this dongle likes 2 of them.Lastly, this thing is NOT durable. Coming from a guy that's been through like 8 mice in 5 years, though, you probably should take this with a grain of salt... You can tell by looking at it that this mouse wasn't built for durability.. which is fine, but you should know that one good slam is all it took to break the mouse in several places, rendering it completely broken. I decided to go ahead and update this review after plugging in my old G502 and getting mad at myself for using this POS Aerox for so long.",
          "you need to be a monkey to reach the 1 2 3 side buttons.Update: after using it for a few months. I love it. I've gotten used to the reach to 1 2 3 but it's still a bit annoying. Aside from that the software is decent. What matters is the light weight and batter life. Which are both amazing.",
          "Based on the customer Q&A I was worried about compatibility for the Steelseries GG software on Apple silicon, I mainly got this so I could play old school Runescape on the couch without having an adapter dongle and cable from my usual G600 everywhere. Luckily as of writing it works  on my 2021 Macbook Pro with the M1 Pro chip running Ventura, I just needed to enable Input Monitoring permission in settings for it to see my aerox 9 in the software. Once you enabled, make sure to quit all steel series processes in activity monitor, then start the steel series software and walk through the set up.It works but with some quirks, first off I was having issues with the aerox 9 wiping my key bindings when switching to bluetooth mode (the main point for me buying was BT mode to avoid having a dongle plugged in). Actually within the software it states that while in BT mode, the bindings and illumination settings will reset to defaults. That seemed incorrect since the mouse is advertised as 18 programmable buttons with Bluetooth. I found that the following works to get custom bindings while in BT mode on the mac:1. Apply desired key bindings using USB-C dongle in 2.4g mode.2. Close steel series (Right click quit Steelseries GG in menu bar)3. Switch to BT mode and unplug USB-C dongle.In this way the aerox 9 saves the bindings while in BT mode. Just know that in BT mode, the polling rate is reduced to 125, which is certainly less smooth than the 1000 of 2.4g mode, but it works fine for not needing a dongle plugged in. The application-specific profile switching works great, you just need the steel series software open for it to work. I tested it on both 2.4g and BT mode.The build quality is fine, nothing extraordinary. Functionally the mouse works exactly as I wanted, so I have nothing to complain about.",
          "The mouse is great on its own, but the battery will barely last a day and the only option that you get in the box is to unplug the wireless dongle and tether the mouse to charge. Why not offer any sort of option for a charging dock?? who at SteelSeries thought this was a good option? its so tedious when the battery dies literally every day and I have to plug it in... If you have a another option in mind over this mouse, take it.Update: after a few months of use, the wireless functionality on the mouse has completely died. It will only worked when plugged in via usb. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. GG Steel Series on this piece of literal garbage.",
          "I have no idea how I managed to use this mouse for 3 weeks. I had to readjust my grip everytime I wanted to press 2 or 3. Maybe I have a small hand? I doubt it.Besides the grip issues, the mouse had great functionality and macro capabilities. If they can fix the mmo button issues, or make them adjustable in the future editions, perhaps I can return to this product.",
          "Pros:lighter than any mouse I've had before12 side buttonsbattery life actually better than expected since advertised battery life on most devices tend to be much higher than reality, can use all day with rgb lights on without needing to stop to plug it inthe cable for the dongle extension is the same cable for the mouse so if you don't have an extra usb-c you don't need to get another (unless you really hate unplugging your dongle)Cons:needed to update the firmware about 50 times before it was completely up-to-date, before firmware updates wouldn't keep any settings and would have to readjust them in app. Each firmware update took a decent amount of time and they wouldn't automatically update when not in use so the app needs to be opened(at least their app is simple). Updating the firmware of the mouse and the dongle has to be done separately, it won't update mouse firmware while the dongle is plugged into the computerWhen switching from wireless to wired or vice-versa the mouse takes about 10-15 seconds to connect and you need to change the switch on the bottom of the mouse to do so, during this time (in my experience) there is also a couple of seconds where my keyboard is disabled.The scroll wheel would squeak (when scrolling obviously) but is squeaking much less lately, not sure what could be causing the squeak but maybe it's just the rubbery material of the wheel rubbing against an internal component.The scrolling is a little sensitive for my preferences as there are some games that use the middle mouse click for an action and use scrolling for another action (I've had to change some controls to avoid mis-inputs)The more technical info:Completely reprogrammable (with steelseries GG app) including macros.Middle mouse click (on scroll wheel) has tilt left and right as well as non-tilt clickStill functions as a mouse without the app, however some additional features may not work without it meaning if you're buying this mouse you'll want to download the free app but for setup purposes and navigating BIOS when you need to you don't need an additional mouseYou can have the rgb completely off if you prefer, but you can completely customize what color(s) the lights are, how fast it changes color, brightness, breathing on/off and speed, color change order, and a \"reactive\" option meaning when you press a button on the mouse it can pulse your choice of color. The lighting also has the option for 3 zones to customize or just set the whole mouse to the same settings.Your generic wireless mouse is roughly 3/4 the length and 2/3 the width of this mouse while being noticeably heavier than this mouseMoves smoothly on hard surface and mouse/desk pad so if you take it with your laptop or just don't have a pad it isn't 100% necessary for ease of use (but still preferred for the sake of keeping debris out of the mouse)The DPI switch can save up to 5 options (can also remove options in case you use fewer) ranging from 100-18000 (completely customizable within that range) and cycles through options with 1 button",
          "This mouse is LONG. Definitely for lorge hands if you have a typical palm grip. I could see claw grips liking this mouse more. I bought this hoping it would be a good wireless replacement for a Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite. Unfortunately the first 3 side buttons sit way too far up for my thumb to reach them comfortably without changing the grip on the mouse. Don't get me wrong, this mouse is awesome, tracking is great, great mouse skates that are super smooth and glide great. Just unfortunately doesn't work for me. I've attached an image that shows the length vs a scimitar. The scimitar side buttons can also be moved forwards and backwards which is an amazing feature in my opinion, letting you set the side buttons to the perfect distance for your hand. The larger buttons on the scimitar also give a better feel for which button you're pressing.",
          "This mouse is about as good as a mouse can be but boy after 1 slight modification.  The mouse is light, flickable, great reception and range, good battery life, great skates(sliders), the scrollwheel is just butter and the tilt function is superb. The only flaw is that the mouse is quite slick feeling. The grip is lacking greatly. People who are having problems pushing the side buttons accidentally, are almost certainly having that problem due to having to squeeze the mouse harder to lift it.This problem completely goes away with grip tape. I bought \u201clizard skins\u201d grip tape and put it on every other button on the thumb side and fully covered the other side. It was a complete game changer. It took this mouse from great to absolutely perfect. I literally can\u2019t think of anything that could be improved. Much more comfortable for long hours as well.  It feels amazing. It\u2019s great for mmo type games but it\u2019s also remarkably good for fps type games.PLEASE don\u2019t be turned off by the lack of grip and issues that could be related to that.  Mouse grip tape is cheap.  Around $10.  Grab some and slap it on there. It\u2019ll change everything.",
          "I got this mouse because it ticked all the feature boxes I needed except for a removable battery, but I understand because that\u2019s not a common need and I knew that before purchasing. I was VERY relieved to find out that the battery life is fantastic! It lasts at LEAST two weeks on one charge with average daily use and occasional multi-hour gaming sessions. One thing to note though is I\u2019m using it on computers that can\u2019t have the device software installed (work comp and a Linux comp) and I don\u2019t know how that may be impacting the load on the battery. The mouse does turn off the RGB lighting when you hold it, and that happens without the device software, which is great because of the large impact on battery life of RGB lighting. (A wireless mouse takes a fraction of the battery power to operate as a mouse compared to RGB lighting). Overall a very well thought out design!",
          "Im have purchased almost every \"Razer naga\" like mouse that has slowly come out on the market through the years. as this new phase of light mice grows i actually found myself really liking the ultra light feel of mice like this, unfortunately got into a habit of using the MMO style 12 button mice. That being said the buttons are unnaturally stiff. to the point where im debating just going back to my naga and returning this or just sucking it up and getting used to it. Along with the insanely stiff side buttons they are layed out in an extremely long layout. Almost all other naga type mice i have used have been in a similar layout that it took no time to get used to. this one feels really quite weird. im also getting weird micro disconnections / the mouse feels laggy in wireless mode if i plug the dongle directly into a USBC on my computer. It comes with an adapter to make the dongle be able to sit closer to the mouse but i dont love that i may HAVE to use that. i really really kind of hate how stiff the buttons are. I understand you dont want to accidently press them but that was never an issue with any other mouse similar to this one. if im playing a shooter i almost have to press hard enought to the point where my aim might shift cause i am switching a weapon or something. Maybe they take time to break in but be weary if you are switching from a naga / corsair Scimitar / or logitech G600",
          "The mouse has a great build and is indeed very lightweight, however, the numpad placement requires really oversized hands to be able to comfortably rest your thumb around the 1-2-3 buttons section instead of lower. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to use. The buttons are also very rough/firm to press which also adds to that, however, its a slightly minor issue compared to the first issue stated.This would've been an overall great mouse if the numpad placement was different or better yet, adjustable.The Scimitar from Corsair went around this issue and made the numpad completely adjustable by the user for example, unfortunately the Scimitar was a bit too bulky for me and I'm looking for a wireless mouse. Looks like I'm sticking with Razer Naga for the foreseeable future.",
          "This mouse itself is top notch, love how light it is. The software and style is fantastic as well but the whole reason I bought it was for the side buttons and they unfortunately are awful. You\u2019ll need an extra long and skinny thumb to use this mouse. Normal thumbs will not reach the front three buttons. Thumbs thicker then a pencil will have issues pressing the bottom row because of how low they are positioned. The top row are easy to press and find but have sharply molded angles where just after an hour of gaming my thumb felt raw. Buttons are all quite small with a click I\u2019m not used to. Couple that with everything else mentioned and you get a very inconsistent experience. PLEASE steel series, make this exact mouse but with half the buttons, smoother angles, larger and I\u2019ll never buy anything else!",
          "Going from a Naga to this I really like the lightness of the mouse, feels great to use but I can't quite get my thumb used to the 12 side buttons yet like I did the naga. the 1-4 seem to far towards the front of the mouse to click comfortably. I re-maped 1-4 to the 5-8 and so on. Still liking it alot",
          "Unfortunately I was looking for an MMO mouse.  In 2023 the industry has pretty much abandoned this type of mouse.  Currently there are only a handful of MMO mice being sold with half being priced at $150 with the others priced around $50.  I found the software to be very unituitive and difficult to use.  Even after a month of use I still haven't figured out how to adjust the RGB lighting.  I also haven't spent any time learning their software because this mouse has no internal memory to save your button configuration internally.  After purchasing a Steam Deck in November I discovered that the majority of my games libraries due to the efforts of the Valve Corporation now runs flawlessly on the Linux OS. The Deck runs Steam OS 3 that is a customized Arch Linux OS.  This has empowered me to finally ditch Microsoft Windows 10 (this is the 2nd worse and most dangerous malware and Spyware software on the planet, this is greatly exceeded by Windows 11).  Currently I am running Grauda Linux (is an Arch bases distro) on all of my PC's and laptops.  It would be nice to be able to set the buttons to keys other than numbers and have this stored in the mouse.  My old Logitech 603 mouse could do this but it has finally given up the ghost.  The other thing I thought I might like has become for me the biggest deal changer is the extremely light weight of the mouse.  It has shown me that I prefer a mouse that has some moderate mass.  I have just ordered a Reddragon M913 Elite mouse here on Amazon for only $43  that will ne delivered tomorrow.  I bet that it will be as good as this expensive mouse.  The only thing it doesn't have is Bluetooth but inspite of this I will be selling this overpriced mouse for whatever I can get."

The software doesn't work with M1 Mac, but I was able to change the color with openRGB. I would definitely buy another one.Only knock is it feels kinda plasticky, cheap, but it's to be expected for the price range. It fits my purpose however, I am a happy customer.",

I like the fact that i can type for hours with not having any disconfort. I have month using it and still love even tho i cant play osu and apex to a good level with it because is not perfect for fast and precise key pressed like circle streams in osu and technical maps or super glide in apex and movement techniques (you can do it but will not always work as you want or need). I must say its actually a good keyboard overall and call it again its membrane with good feel. if you can buy the mechanical version i think i can do the trick.",

I have had to open the software and  change the lighting zone color to get the backlight to work again, but for that zone. After repeating for each zone, I finally have a lit keyboard again. My corsair 60% keyboard lights back up without trouble when pressing a key to come out of sleep mode or when I reboot of the computer.

So for the amount of noise it makes, I don't think it can be beat.  Gold star for quietness.The backlit portion is my gripe.  The number keys are a pain to read because the numbers and symbols are the same size and not well lit.  I thought I could make the backlit color white in hopes of making it glaringly bright, but no.  Setting the color selector to white still leaves the keyboard a lavender color rather than true white.  Despite my complaint, I am happy with my purchase.",

Whether you use the keyboard flat or raised in the back the wrist rest is comfortable and stays in place.",
          "There are many good things about this keyboard but overall, I don't recommend this keyboard and I will explain why.First some positive points:+Appearance; This keyboard simply looks amazing. With light on or off it just looks so minimal and beautiful. The RBG colors are probably one of the best I have ever seen.+Media keys: they volume wheel and the pause/play button are really helpful.+The wrist rest: This is my favorite thing about this keyboard.  Some Youtube reviewers say it feels cheap but I just love it. It could be slightly wider to support larger hands but it\u2019s just great. So easy to clean and not too rough and not to soft like razer wrist rests.+Cable routing options: it really helps to keep your cable out of the way and keep you desk organized.+Build quality: The keyboard feels solid and really sturdy on your desk. It also doesn\u2019t move or slip. The wrist rest doesn\u2019t move either.+The font/legends: they are standard and aren\u2019t weird looking.+Steel series engine is really amazing. So easy to use and really helpful+You can change RGB effects and macro functions without having to use the software which is really convenient.Now, let\u2019s take a look at some negatives:-the keycaps: The keycaps feel really really cheap. Even after only 3 weeks of use, I feel the surface of the keys that I use feel washed out and a bit smoother than the first day. They also have a quality to them that makes them extra noisy and rattly.-the switches: I have so many problems with the switches. First of all, why blue switches? Almost no gamer prefers blue switches for gaming and this keyboard is advertised and designed for gamers. So this is the first really weird choice. Honestly, I feel they decided to use blue switches because they are targeting younger generation who are probably buying a mechanical keyboard for the first time so they wanted to give them something that feels and sounds a lot different than a membrane or a laptop keyboard but I simply hate these switches. They are loud in the most annoying way. I have heard other blue switches and some of the have a sophisticated quality to them but these simply sound horrible.Anther extremely negative aspect of this keyboard is that it uses \u201cHybrid\u201d switches. (you can see on youtube what they are) This is bad because of two reasons. First of all, with the same price or even cheaper, you can get fully mechanical keyboards that feel and sound 100 times better. Also, if one of your switches breaks (like mine did) there is no way you can find a replacement for them. I contacted Steelseries and they simply said they don\u2019t sell the switches separately. One of the main reasons why people buy mechanical keyboards is to be able to replace dead or broken switches which is impossible with Apex 5. I ended up asking for a replacement, but the second keyboard was defective as well (the space bar got stuck in place). Luckily, amazon had my back and refunded almost all my money. One last problem I have with the switches is that they don\u2019t feel reliable. Although they are blue (clicky and tactile), the switches sometimes actuate before the click which automatically cancels the whole point of the keyboard being tactile. :DThe switches are produced by a Chinese company called TTC. I have never heard their name so it\u2019s easy to put the blame on them but it is a Steel series product after all.-The OLED: It looks cool but it\u2019s just useless. It does all the thing they claim is does but I\u2019m not the kind of person to put the time to get used to it. I simply prefer 3 simple LED light for Caps, numlock and scroll lock.What annoys me the most about this keyboard in general is that it doesn\u2019t hold up to older Steelseries products quality. To me, it is clear that Steel series is targeting the less experienced consumers and not professional gamers anymore. I mean, there is no way a pro gamer puts up with this quality. It is just unacceptable from Steel Sereis. I have a Steel series mouse and I\u2019ll probably buy another Steel series mouse after this one. But I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t buy their keyboards at least for a long time.All in all, this is simply a bad keyboard for this price. Yes, it has many cool features but there are so many better keyboards that you can find so almost half the price. Honestly, after some research on the internet, I am convinced that gaming brand keyboards are not worth it because they are almost always over-priced.",
          "My son was shocked to get this for Christmas! Apparently it is one of the top performing keyboards for gaming? Honestly, I had no idea. It lights up and it is really cool on his gaming desk. Scored a lot of points with this one and it wasn\u2019t that expensive in my opinion.",
          "Honestly, I was skeptical due to me buying the Apex 3 and trying it out to feel disappointed but this one right here is spectacular. I mean its not the greatest keyboard in existence but its worth the money.",
          "It looks great, is easy to type on, and the included magnetic wrist rest is a bonus.However, I took a star off because of the placement of the Numlock, Capslock, Scrllock lights.  They are nestled right up against the top of the 10 key area and are impossible to see unless you are hunched right over the keyboard.  Very puzzling design choice. Also, while it's not that clicky, it's not that quiet either.",
          "It's a nice keyboard honestly. Very nice. It can be a bit on the noisy side but it works as intended. Works good for the games I have. Keys are accurate  great lighting for the keyboard interchangeable. Awesome. Recommended.",
          "I bought this because the basic (cherry stream tkl) keyboard I had before wouldn't let me strafe, run forward, and cast my spell I had bound to \"z\" at the same time (couldn't register \"w\" \"d\" and \"z\" at the same time), but this keyboard has no such issue, and feels great to boot. I have used mechanical cherry blue switches and actually kind of prefer how quiet this membrane keyboard is to that. It feels really nice to type on. The backlight can be dimmed or disabled without any software using a key combo. the cable can be routed out the middle, left, or right side of the back end. It feels really solid for being non-metal. 5 stars, and it boasts water resistance. this thing is fantastic.",
          "The keyboard does a good job and does look slick. It, however, is not that comfortable to use. The magnetic board it comes with for your wrist is just metal and can start to hurt the wrist. It would have been good if it was cushioned. Also it would have been nice to have a indicator for the caps and numb lock keys as you can't tell when they are on.",
          "A great product for gaming and regular computer work. The key strokes are loud but worth it, for  the gaming world, but if you need a keyboard that doesn't make noise ( quiet Environment) then this isn't the one for you.  I like making noise so for me it was great.",
          "This is my review of the SteelSeries Apex 3 corded keyboard, with number keypad. I do not game, and I have a Windows 10 desktop computer.I've been computing since 1985, and this is easily among the best keyboards I've used, both professionally and at home. I almost wish my Perixx keyboard had broken sooner.PROS:1. Nice weight, with very nice rubber footing. The keyboard's tilt stands are exceptional quality, and include the rubber footing. There are three options for cord routing under the keyboard.2. The volume control knob is well made, easy to use, and provides a tactile feedback. Each click of the wheel bumps the volume by two steps. It takes me four quick turns of the wheel to go from zero to full volume. Clicking the knob mutes and un-mutes the volume. I find it intuitive and easy to use.3. A single click of the media button will play/pause, and it works fine with iHeart, YouTube and other online media. A double-click forwards to the next track, and a triple-click goes back one track.4. Typing is supreme. The keys have a slightly firm feel, with just the right amount of tension that reminds me of the high quality keyboards of yesteryear. I find myself typing faster and with less errors.5. The keys are not completely silent, but there are no audible clicks and it won't wake the household at night. I only hear gentle keystrokes as I type.6. The overall construction is excellent. There's no unusual flexing, rattling, etc. The keys are well set, with not even the slightest rattle if you shake the keyboard. The key caps have no perceptible side-to-side play in normal use.7. This is a membrane keyboard, with a spill-proof design. But if I didn't know better, I would swear in court that it's a mechanical keyboard.8. The keyboard remembers settings, even after unplugging it and then plugging it back in. Note that I am using the Engine software with custom settings applied.CONS:1. The indicator lights (num lock/caps lock, etc.) are very poorly placed just above the number keypad. I have to sit forward over the keyboard to see the lights, or I have to tilt the keyboard back. Hopefully a future revision will fix this irritation.2. The zone lighting (ten in all) works well, but it is not as good as individual key cap lighting. The key characters are not as bright as I prefer, and the light spill is slightly distracting. In reality, it works and it's easy to get used to it. At this price point, it's easy to forgive.3. The preset keyboard profiles do not have any single-color patterns. You have to download and install the software to achieve that. BEWARE that in the Engine software, you must FIRST select the zones that you want to adjust, or nothing will happen.4. The keyboard lighting goes off when the computer is shut down (this is good), but not when the computer sleeps. I don't use hibernate or any other sort of deep sleep, so I don't know how that will work.5. There is no USB extension port.All of the dual function key characters are oddly reversed. For example, the special characters on the number row are on the bottom half, and the numbers are on the top half. The numbers are the default, and the special characters require using the shift key as normal. I don't understand the thinking that went into this.I don't use the palm rest, but it appears to be as high quality as the rest of the keyboard.In all, the cons are minor. The keyboard looks and feels so good that it's easy to overlook my dislikes. It oozes quality, despite the low price. If I could, I'd rate it 4.5 stars.",
          "The keyboard looks and feels great, very good build quality!Super satisfied honestly.Also very quiet",
          "Keyboard feels very solid, it probably weights 3x as much as a cheap keyboard, hoping it will last for a long time. The buttons feel like a mechanical keyboard so you have to press them a little hard, which some people may like and others may dislike. The lighting was a bit of a let down for me though. For one thing the little lights that indicate if caps lock is on etc. are difficult to see, I have to lean forward to see over the 18 key section to see if they are on or not, not a very thoughtful placement. A better placement would be on the keys themselves. It's great that you can use the desktop software to customize the colored lighting, but I found that when I disconnected from my desktop and plugged the keyboard into my work laptop it would not continue as I set it, it would just stay static on 1 or 2 random colors and I can't install the software on my work machine. The color button doesn't do anything by itself, not very useful. It would be much better if the lighting profiles were saved to the keyboard itself then if you could tap the button to change through your color profiles that would be great. Lastly I thought it would be cool if I could assign a different color to sections like the 18 key section, F keys, directional arrows and so forth, but the software doesn't allow for creating sections or assigning colors to individual keys, it can only go in about 7 preconfigured sections.",
          "I'm having a great time typing this review on this beautiful keyboard. It is very comfortable, very pleasant to print, play on it. True, until I figured out the application to adjust the light on it, I think I can do it. I fell in love with this company's products. My next order will be a mouse.",
          "Now I wouldn't say I'm a 'hardcore gamer' but I dabble here and there. Decided to spice up my keyboard game and did some YouTube searching on reviews. Came across a review on this SteelSeries and I thought, \"What the heck, I'll give it a shot for that price!\"As soon as I started using it, I fell in love right away. The keys are so smooth and quiet, I almost want to take it to work and use it. The lights are bright and I love that you can customize the color for each zone; makes for some neat color combos! The software you can download, but not required, is very easy to navigate and use. The audio controls I'm not a huge fan of but the idea is pretty neat. And lastly, the wrist rest has a nice feel to it, not soft by any means but it raises your wrists a bit; also easily removeable as it connects with magnets.All in all, it's a keyboard you have to try out. It's not gonna break your bank and if you end up not liking it, it's only 40-50 bucks. Now to some that's a lot of money but if you look around at other gaming keyboards, some are upwards of 100+.",
          "This keyboard is my favorite out of any keyboard I've ever owned. The keys are nice and quiet as advertised, and the RGB is really customizable. It's also the perfect size, which makes typing fast really easy.The only thing I would say isn't perfect on this keyboard is that some of the colors aren't as bright as I would like, but I could easily change that probably by choosing a brighter/lighter color. Also, the wrist rest is not really supportive at all so I don't use it.",
          "LOVE THIS KEYBOARD - LIGHTS HAVE MULTIFUNCTIONS.  THERES A MAGNETIC ERGONOMIC HAND REST TOO THAT I LOVE.  OVER ALL THIS IS THE BEST KEYBOARD I HAVE EVER USED!",
          "Really worth the extra money to me. Really nice keycaps and metal construction. This is my first higher end keyboard, have only owned sub $50 keyboards up till now. I just ordered a 2nd for my work computer.",
          "I\u2019ve tried a couple and this is by far the best so far. The redragon keyboards are hot garbage and not for gaming.",
          "Love the sound, the feel, and the all the customization options. The OLED screen and volume scroller are really useful. My only con is that for some keys like the comma/< it can be hard to see the secondary character (e.g. < and > are hard to see even with max brightness). Brighter LEDs or different key caps would solve this issue.",
          "Keys feel too high, though it reminds me mechanical keyboards so for some people this might better feature. Build quality feels good, I loved magnets on the hand rest. Light struggles to provide crisp and vibrant color, I have rival 3 mouse which has a lot better lighting. Cable is thick and looks sturdy.",
          "Until now the most expensive keyboard i'd ever purchased cost me about $45 bucks. It set the bar for what I thought I liked.  Not withstanding the fact I never even paid for a keyboard before, $45 was huge for me and especially since there was always two or three keyboards laying around in a closet.  I was happy with purchase, what I really liked about it was it featured a number pad and a touch pad.  It lasted a good while but like the other's which came before the space bar started throwing craps. Because of my  heavy thumbs.  So after lots of research looking for the best quality keyboard maker  the Steel Series reputation made it stand out from  a sea of other cool keyboards.  Right out the box the Steel Series 5 felt like the experience of a flagship cell phone or something.  It has a modern feel and texture to it and lights up to boot.  I didn't start out looking for the backlit keys but they are such a major upgrade I should've done it much sooner.  Not only can I now type with the lights off but another weakness of my last keyboard was eliminated.  Letters worn off the keys.  I was more then willing to sacrifice the touch pad ,which is not offered, for the backlit keys.  Now I would be remiss if I failed to speak glowingly about how fast and clicky klacket this keyboard is to use.  And others might also  gush at  how high tech the Steel Series are with their  Digital display feature and the app you can download that provides you  all kinds of customization options.  I also love it for sure.  But be warned there is a dark side to the App.  I quickly discovered that depending on your operating system {I have the old windows 7)  Downloading the app can make your Steel Series keyboard stop working completely and lock you out of it.  Crazy Right?  And this is not an uncommon problem.  I am fairly computer savvy so I got past this however I had to breakout my old keyboard in order to even type for the solution on YouTube and then reset things as needed.  Before downloaded the app everything was just plug and play.  However one feature you will need to assign to the keyboard is a  caps lock indicator.  I set mine cap key to go yellow when on.  I am pretty certain  that If you have a newer operating systerm you will probably not have any issues but if you have an older one then make sure you are careful to  download of  older version of the app.  If you don't get it right the first time  I would even go so far as to say a person less resourceful then myself might've just returned the thing.  But don't let me scare you off this is the best keyboard in the world they say.",
          "I really like this keyboard. I was hesitant to try it since I prefer the keyboards with the low profile keys, but after not being able to find one that looked appealing, I settled on the Apex 3. It is louder than my low profile Logitech, and Razer keyboards, but I really don't mind since that wasn't the reason I chose this.The Steel Series software is nice, and works well for multi-tasking, unlike the Razer software. My biggest gripe with this keyboard is that the placement of the keys lock light is hidden behind keys (unless you are sitting in a position where your head is directly over the keyboard) and the fact that the software doesn't provide an onscreen keys lock display. Otherwise very nice to type on and I love the volume roller.",
          "interchangeable lighting, also you can customize games and they key binds ect in the settings for you steelseries products which is extremely useful if you play multiple games online! So far this keyboard has not let me down in function/keystrokes and versatility!",
          "I am not easily impressed and i am not one who would normally spend $50 on a keyboard... This is my first product from Steel SeriesLet me just get this 1 Major Negative out of the way first. This prevented a 5-star review that i nearly never give <sigh>1. The default light pattern is RGB and you have little control out of the box, at best you can control the speed at which the color changed across the zones. Quick google search said you need to install the OEM software to get more control over the colors. Hmm, i wasn't pleased about that but so be it, a lot of OEMs do it and its just more crap running on your pc to slow it down..2. Software installed was 270MB, pretty darn big TBH, It installed tons of irrelevant stuff for products i do not own.. This could certainly have been done better.3. YOU MUST CREATE AN ACCOUNT with Steel Series to change anything about your product!!!! WHY??? Just another account username and password to track just so i can set a static color???**On the bright side, the control software Does Not need to run to keep your color settings, i do suspect if you use the other feature the software provides then you may have to have the software running in the background.OK, that is the ONLY gripe i have so far, Tempted to give a 3- star but that would be me placing too much weight on something that really annoys me and not fair to this product.So, What is good about this item? Taking the software issue out of the equation, it would be a 5 star product for sure. The only thing that would make it better is a lower price.I had just a few simple requirements for my keyboard.- Quiet - I hate the clackity clack typing sound especially when gaming- Backlit - I hate RGB and rolling RGB on a keyboard, i find it distracting. I like a nice soft glow to illuminate the keys so i can see the letters in the dark. I used to use blue or purple but have settled on red these past few years.- Compact, but full keyboard layout (108 keys?) - I hate big @$$ keyboards with tons of buttons, switches and misc. macro keys. Yes they have their purpose and are useful to some people, guess I'm getting old an traditional.- Durability - Who doesn't want that???Side note, Ergonomics IMHO is a personal preference but i kind of feel like the buttons are too high against the base but the keypresses are solid and actuation defined like when pulling the trigger on a quality firearm, you barely feel the slack being taken up and the you get a crisp break of the trigger.Very light keys with positive stroke, it's just good, end of story.All boxes checked with this keyboard - Durability TBD but it feels pretty solid so far. Backlight can be very dim or resemble the surface of the sun (not quite but it is bright). I know they call it \"Steel Series\" but this thing as some weight to it, it's not heavy but it is clearly not just a block of super thin/cheap plastic..I have not thoroughly explored the software capability but a brief romp around the menu's looks to be extremely inclusive and a similar type ecosystem to Corsair's iCue ecosystem which allows the software to interface and control all aspects of the OEM's product line. I found a lack of details or explanations for some of the features but not to terrible, most options are pretty straight forward.I believe in HONEST reviews and this has been my honest review that i almost didn't do but morally i have to give credit to Steel Series on a good product, they earned that much especially since this is the first product of theirs i have ever purchased.",
          "My love for this keyboard is so deep it's borderline irrational. It feels mechanical, but makes no annoying clicking noises. The construction is solid, and I don't know what the wrist rest is made of, but it feels delightfully silken almost.I really appreciate the lighting as well. It's diffuse enough to not cast glare on my glossy screened display, and stays lit when my PC is off, so its great for a dark office.The only thing I can really find to complain about is the finish being so dark black, that dust and skin oils are constantly visible on the keyboard unless it was recently cleaned. This is a minor nitpick, and it doesn't bother me enough to subtract a star. Five star keyboard!",
          "I bought this keyboard for 69usd and for the price its well worth it. I love it, it feels good and solid, the looks are amazing. I type on the fly and game very accurately no input lag whatsoever. Oled is pretty useful to review system information, loads and temperature. Very impressed.",
          "This is by far, the best keyboard I have ever had. I use it for both work and gaming. The keys feel nice, the colors are pretty, and it has held up well to wear and tear by my nails. There is absolutely no evidence of the print rubbing off the keys like every other keyboard has done. It is also by far the quietest keyboard I have had yet. I am a happy customer. It was a good choice for me.",
          "Great keyboard the key caps are lacking but can be replaced. Great UI on the screen easy to navigate, nice volume scroll control awesome colors and very clicky",
          "As many before me, I crashed my great lighted KB which I had loved for 4 or 5 years. It was always doing great till one day it died! There are many things in reference to computers that can be hair-pulling, but loss of the KB ranks right up there, especially if you have no replacement to grab! I didn't, and I hate the virtual KB available in Windows.I am not a gamer, just a slow typist and need those lighted keys! OK, here is my likes: 1) The absolutely stunning lighted base and each lighted key! Great night light to find my way to the head in the middle of the night! 2) The keys are over-sized a bit (shaky fingers) and the letters are large and exceptionally  legible. 3) Tactile feedback reminds me of the old IBM clickable keys, which I really loved, not being a touch-typist.I purchased this one in May of '22 and was so happy using it that I purchased a second as a spare, as I damn sure don't want to have to use the virtual KB again!This KB feels like it is well-made and with the revolving (brightness adjustable) colors is kinda' neat. Oh, I am 76 years old and I've not played a lot of games. The only ones I recall are Star Trek (with asterisks launched) to shoot down Klingons, Mission Command, and those great text-based D&D-type text adventurer games, so this one is great for what I need!Hopefully my Apex 3 TKL RGB KB and I  can last beyond 80, but if one of us doesn't, I'll have a spare for my kids (53 & 46)!Thanks to  the manufacturer for a fine product!Alan Arnold",

          "I love this keyboard and I can't say it enough. Make sure to download the extra software that comes free with it. My only gripe is that there is no way to customize individuals keys on the number pad. They are only customizable with the keyboard as a whole. 4/5 stars.",
          "This keyboard has it all.  I played around with the sensitivity settings of the keys and it is day and night.  If I want the slightest touch to activate it then it works.  If I want that mushy feel it does it also, that is just awesome how you can adjust the travel of the keys.The LED colors are also very good and they have fun settings.  Like for instance if you press a key I have my keyboard to give the affect of a splash effect so the other keys ripple away from the one I depressed.The small LCD screen is good enough to read and I hope in the future they build off of that.  The palm rest is good, but I can see that it attracts everything.  So wiping it down from time to time is a good thing.I was asked how to keep the gaps of the keys so clean?  A paint brush will get all those food particles, dust and anything else out and it is gentle on the keys.The volume control is great to have and the USB ports are also a good measure to add peripherals.You can change the LED patterns and what they do; lots to choose from.  On thing though is that if you are not use to seeing no indicators of CAPS on or Number Lock ON then you will need to get use to this keyboard as this is handled by color.  Caps on will have the CAPS button turn white.  When it is off it just becomes what color your scheme is.  Same with numbers lock.It is not cheap, but if you are gamer and love keyboards like this then it is worth the cost; I am loving it.",

Even the attachable wrist guard FEELS really high quality and durable.Definitely worth the sale price I got it at!(I'd like it more if the lights on the keys themselves could be a bit brighter but that's a personal thing)",

          "The steelseries apex pro mechanical gaming keyboard is a keyboard I really wanted to love. I have been looking forward to being able to have the best of both worlds with fast linear switches when I'm gaming and need every advantage I can get, and going back to a high quality typing experience when I am living the professional life. Maybe this keyboard will be that for some people, as the switches themselves are subject to the users preference. However I can share my experience and preferences to hopefully guide whether or not this keyboard is good for you.For starters, I have been using Razer Green switches for the majority of my typing experience over the last 5+ years. I have also enjoyed using some Outemo blue switches on a redragon keyboard I used for a short while and Cherry Browns are my next alternative that I have tested. Cherry reds are good for gaming but I have found them to be to easy to click making typos more frequent when typing at a fast APM or preparing to press a key.If I had to compare the switches here, the closest I can compare them to are Reds or Razers Omnipoint switches. They were very fast to click, and honestly I just don't enjoy that experience enough to be able to commit a long portion of time to try and learn how to best deal with it. The keyboard also wasn't as silent as other options which felt like a weird trade when the other options were pretty good at being silent alternatives.Diving a bit further, this keyboards saving grace was supposed to be the adjustable actuation switches to cover all scenarios. However in my short opinion of the device, I couldn't tell much of a difference between the different modes. You can set different macros to have the different actuations be quickly accessible if you do find 2 or more you like if that's your type of thing.Lastly, the build quality did feel quite well made. There's a simple yet nice magnetic wrest which ended up being something I used as the legs don't adjust the height very much. On the back there's an illuminated USB port you can use, tho I found it to be more noticeable then other keyboards which opted me to not route my mouse through it anymore. The RGB is very bright if that's your thing but after doing a few tests I left it on static red to match my other peripherals.All in all, a well made keyboard, and if I was opting solely for gaming and was using other steelseries peripherals I would probably love it. However steelseries doesn't have a proper MMO option (please create a proper naga competitor, please), wasn't the biggest fan of the included keycaps, lack of dedicated macro / media keys, the poor height adjustment kind of made this not good enough to replace my current blackwidow. Not to mention the poor placement of the passthrough usb being in a very awkward spot, and no headphone passthrough port (surprisingly useful for me). Great attempt steelseries, hope you keep innovating on the next one despite this not being for me in the end and bet the Blue or Brown switch options would have been more up my alley.Last note, almost forgot to comment on the OLED panel and it was a little bit of a disappointment that I wiped it from my memory. The tech geek in me was hype to just have a little toy with it however it ended up being way more boring for a multi monitor user. If I had only had a single or dual monitor maybe it could have some value, but I got 3 at the moment so I just couldn't find anything useful to put on it. I'd rather just toss discord on a side screen than look at my keyboard for the messages. Most gifs I tried to put on it didn't come out well either, and while tempted to recreate them for the screen there was no value in doing so. I'll end with I just left a logo I liked on it, and noticed that the backlight made the internal panel way more visible than I imagined through the \"top\" piece of it, and look way less fancy than it appears in the marketing. Leaving me sorely disappointed and bored with the feature, despite how cool it might feel.",
          "It's been my daily driver at work (web developer) and it's by far the best keyboard I've ever used. The switches feel and sound great, the lights are bright, and the LED screen in the corner is just fun. Absolutely love the GG program for changing up the light patterns, every key can be individually adjusted for brightness, color, illumination pattern, etc.",
          "I am in love with this keyboard this is my first time ever purchasing a steelseries product and after watching some videos and reading some reviews I decided to give it a try. I was using a razer huntsman elite with the optical purple switches and I also have a corsair k95 rgb platinum I've also used. This keyboard beats them both hands down the switches in this are buttery smooth and super light and leniar. The biggest selling point to me is the ability to adjust your key actuation to suit your playstyle. I will say tho that only 60 of the keys use the adjustable keyswitches and the rest are linear red switches. I would also recommend that you buy or swap the stock keycaps to something a bit more comfortable. I purchased the black and white prism keycaps and it's the best typing experience I've ever had.",
          "This is a very solid keyboard. It's heavier than most and stays put.My only surprise is the keys don't click. The adjustable engagement point is a nice touch",
          "The overall quality and feel of the keyboard are really good, but after less than a year, the magnets on the handrest just popped out and broke. It 's still usable, but I have to push in the handrest every couple of minutes.",
          "I have used this keyboard for almost a year now. The overall use of the keyboard is very good, the fact that you can customize the actuation point is pretty neat, for example, I have a profile for gaming, and a profile for typing with different actuation points. Also, each key can have its own actuation point.The backlit keys are still in great brightness, similar to when new, so that is good. The keyboard has a nice sound to it when you type, similar to that of Cherry Silvers. The sound might be a bit loud though if you are typing in a public quiet area, or at night with people around. The keyboard is liner, so there is no actuation feel, similar to that of the Cherry Blues.The only downside to this is the keycaps started peeling after  3 months. For me it is mainly the '1' key, but the 'W' and 'S' key has very minor peeling too. The peeling is the rubber coating coming off the outside of the keycaps. I think the '1' key took the most abuse because I use that to alternate weapons in games (Modern Warfare 2019), and I had picked on it with my fingernail. But the good thing is replacement keycaps aren't too expensive.The OLED screen is kind of a gimmick, I don't use it much at all. But the somewhat cool thing about it is that you can put an image or a gif on it. So I have a gif running on the OLED screen at all times.Overall, its a great keyboard, and I would recommend it to everyone looking for a linear feeling keyboard.",
          "was using steelseries apex 500 for 5 years before this one. It was still working great but keyboard was getting too dirty so I upgraded it to this one. So far, so good. I don't like backlit so I turned it off but well, it would be good for users who like it. Smooth keyboard experience and I love it.Highly recommended. Only downside is only 1 year warranty in US but considering my previous steelseries keyboard is 5 years old and still kicking, this one will last just as long. :)",
          "When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board.  After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint.  The Browns have a tactile point which I liked.  I had tried MX Reds, and wasn't a fan of the linear feel.  With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro.  TBH, I was half expecting to return it.  Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!First off... dat switch.  Wow.  SUPER smooth.  The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE.  It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base.  The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people.  (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool)  Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely.  This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!Another key strength... the RGB lighting.  Its nothing short of fantastic.  The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect.  Even for those who don't much care about RGB lighting, it's very tastefully done here.Typing is unreal.  I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up.  And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns.  I'd commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn't happen anymore.  Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.Not much bad to say here.  Some minor gripes would be somewhat \"meh\" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps.  The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue.  Not sure how that would affect the lighting though.  The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn't add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want.  It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software.  Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches.  All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough.  Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn't a big deal to me.All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect.  I really wish MS terrible updates hadn't bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason.  If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you.  Very hard to fault this board.  Steelseries done good here.",
          "I recently purchased the Steel Series Apex Pro Keyboard with the Rival 650 Gaming Mouse and Prism XL mouse pad. The moment I got this keyboard out of the box, I could tell that this keyboard was different than the knock off gaming keyboard I was currently using. The omnipoint mechanical gaming switches are engineered with magnetic sensor instead of the traditional switch used in my previous keyboard. This allows the user to adjust the exact distance the key needs to be pressed for it to register. After configuring the keyboard to my personal preferences, I\u2019ve seen a noticeable improvement in my response time! This increased response time has made all the difference in my Warzone gameplay as I have been averaging alot more kills/downs rather than deaths when engaging an enemy in game! I love how the OLED screen can be configured to allow for quick adjustments and multiple profiles without having to go into the SteelSeries Engine to make modifications! The detachable magnetic wrist rest is something I didn\u2019t expect to use but I actually love how it feels and how it looks on top of my Prism mouse pad. I also use this keyboard with my Macbook Pro and I haven\u2019t had any issue with it working across the different operating systems so if you\u2019re a techy like myself and have both windows and mac, you can rest assured this keyboard will do it all! Don\u2019t continue to get by with a knockoff gaming keyboard, instead elevate your gameplay with this bad boy! Trust Me, I know you\u2019ll be thankful you made the change! I know I certainly am beyond satisfied at my purchase!",
          "This keyboard helped me realize that the difference between a 50$ keyboard and a 200$ keyboard is pretty much the same except for a few cosmetic features. If you got the extra money and care for a few extra cosmetics this is the keyboard, it works great and it has a lot of cosmetic features that I haven't seen on previous keyboards I've owned",
          "I'm not a gamer but was looking for a really cool and well bult mechanical keyboard. The typing experience on this keyboard alone is worth it and I have only scratched the surface on the features. I am using it for strictly business.",
          "So, I just hoooked this up. I just don't know yet. I have not installed software or done much of anything yet.I just trashed my G710+, which was 12 years ole and I kept getting broken keys because I type a LOT since I'm a software engineer. But I loved the keyboard so much, I really hated to let it go.This one, right off I can say it is not as 'clicky as the G710. I also so not like the wrist wrest, at all. I don't like the feel of it. It's not very comfortable and whatever the material is, I hate the feel of it, it's like it's slick and my plams just want to slide off of it and I feel like my palms will get sweaty from laying aginat this all day.We'll see afte a little more use, I just don't know yet, so I'll give it a 3. I want my G710+ back! The only thing about that is the keys tend to break and it was impossible to keep it clean the way there so many crevices and space under the keys for dust to hide in.Anyway, this is funny. I went and got the palm wrest off my G710+ and the tabs on it fit right under this keyboard and I can move it around the desk without it even moving! So I'm keeping it, the feel is so much better than the magnetic thing they sent. I like the feel of the plastic so much better than whatever that material is.Also, I cannot type as fast on thie keyboard as I could the G710+. I hink because it's smaller, more compact and I don't have tiny hands and fingers. And maybe because I'm just not used to it, but I think it's because it's smaller.",
          "Has all the good stuff you want plus some but instead of trying to figure out what color keys \"sensitivity\" I need and having to make a tough choice because I dont know the difference. I bought this one and it rocks!!",
          "I replaced an 8 year old Corsair K70 Vengeance keyboard with this one. The SteelSeries Apex Pro has more color options, the key presses are quieter, and I have no complaints.",
          "UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I've been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I've had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.Obviously the Model M is bigger overall, but my big realization is that the actual key layout on the Model M is slightly wider. It's not just a difference in the \"dead space\" in between keyboard sections, either - there is actually slightly less space between each key on the Steelseries keyboard. I've compared all the keyboards I've owned against the Model M and while some have had minor layout variations and most these days have the function keys much closer to the main keys, this is the first time I've seen keys that were actually closer together. I'm sure it's not the only keyboard like that, but it's the only one I've owned that is and it explains my typing inaccuracy on it. I've taken a star off my original review for that reason. It is just not a full size keyboard, even though it looks like it is. It feels cramped, and I've never gotten fully adjusted to it.My original review is below:----------------------------------------For the price, it had better be good. And it is. My score is 5 stars but consider it more like 4 1/2 rounded up. A bit closer to 5 than 4; not perfect but nearly so. I'll explain.I'm both a typist and a gamer, but these days probably more of the former than the latter. Still, I try to find keyboards good for both purposes, and many are - heck, the old IBM Model M is still a great gaming keyboard if you don't need n-key rollover (and to be honest, most people really don't). But my old Motospeed keyboard, which I loved for its feel and its small footprint (as small as it gets for a full size keyboard) seemed to just wear out - it started repeating keypresses constantly, so I decided I'd just go for something new rather than try to fix it. (But I probably will fix it at some point; it's a great keyboard too.)This is the first linear keyboard I've owned in many years. I usually prefer clicky keyboards and have since the days of the original IBM PC and the Model F. But I just wanted something different after owning clicky keyboards for so long, and my Motospeed was *really* clicky to the point that it did become a little grating after a few years. I'd read about the wonders of the OmniPoint keyswitches in the Apex Pro and I watched the excellent Chyrosran22 review of it on YouTube (search for that; he knows keyboards and he loves this one). I did also manage to try one out for a brief few minutes, though not long enough to really form my own opinion. But in the absence of any more obvious choice, I took the plunge and bought one.Bottom line: It is a really well built keyboard (almost zero flex) that feels *almost* as good to type on as any linear keyboard I've ever used in about 40 years of computing. It has double-shot keycaps so the legends won't wear out, it's got a really useful volume roller, and it's got a little screen that can be used for various things, most of which are kinda dumb but I do use it for displaying current system stats - there is an app to display CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Its backlighting is pretty bright, fully RGB and has some effects that are actually kinda useful - I'm not sure what the effect I use is called, but it just lights the key you press up in white for a half-second or so before smoothly fading it back to whatever color the rest of the keyboard is backlit in. It's actually helpful to have a little split-second feedback showing which key you just typed, just in case you make a mistake.The OnmiPoint keyswitches do feel great - very smooth - and they're user-adjustable in terms of the actuation point. This is unique to this type of keyswitch, which is an uncommon magnetic sensor type of mechanical switch. I will say that I *feel* more accurate on this keyboard than my old Motospeed - I think the design and spacing of the keycaps on this keyboard is maybe a little more standard.So, that's that - now I'm going to tell you about the *little* things that keep it from being perfect. Keep in mind that absolutely none of these are dealbreakers, or things other people might even necessarily think of as drawbacks. But...The cord is non-detachable and it's quite stiff. It's also just rubber insulated, which is fine, but kinda ugly on such an expensive keyboard. The keyboard has two USB plugs, one for the USB port on the keyboard itself (it won't act as a hub, just a pass-through), and that USB plug is on the left side of the keyboard. That means if you want the keyboard cable on the right, which the cable management on the back of the keyboard lets you do, your mouse cable will still be on the left. I feel like this is an odd design given that most people are right-handed. A choice would be best, but if you're going to pick a place for one USB port, put it on the right.Only the \"main\" keys are OmniPoint - that's everything in the little \"typewriter\" cluster, that main rectangle of letters and numbers that you type the most on. The others are either Cherry MX Red or some kind of copy of them. To be honest, I'm not sure which switch I prefer! I know which I'm \"supposed\" to prefer but the regular Reds on the rest of the keyboard seem to have a very slightly lighter weighting. Probably my only semi-serious complaint about the keyboard in general - and this is 100% subjective, so it's not a top-line item for this review - is that the OmniPoint switches are just a *tiny* bit heavier than I like, and probably as a consequence of that feel very, very slightly \"mushy\" as you reach full travel. The switches on the rest of the board, while very slightly \"grittier\", are also a tiny bit lighter and do not feel mushy. All that said, I will allow that someone else could feel entirely the opposite. This is personal preference, and anyway it's not a big difference. But there *is* a difference in the switches on different parts of the board, and it does sometimes feel a little odd as a result.After only several *days* of use, the soft-touch finish is already wearing off several of the keys. Now, you can see by this review that I type a *lot*. So it may take longer for you, and anyway the legends themselves will never wear off since they're doubleshot. But my space bar is already looking a little ugly with one part of it already noticeably shiny. I never understand this - my Model F and Model M that are 30+ years old still look brand new, while a keyboard that's only days old (and cost a couple hundred bucks) already has a finish that's wearing off.Overall, though, I think I'll be happy with this keyboard until I get tired of linear keys and want to go back to clicky. But who knows when or if that'll happen. At the moment, I'm pleased with my purchase, even for the money. This thing does feel like an expensive keyboard.",

          "here we go... hopefully my tech review career takes off..This keyboard has a lot of good features that I feel are important for a \"Gaming grade\" keyboard. its very very sturdy, has adjustable keystroke actuation times, has a surprisingly helpful wrist rest. And has some tasty RGB to go with it... very important.After a few months use its been very very nice. it can withstand any gamer rage and having the ability to adjust from early keystroke actuation for gaming, and normal keystroke actuation for typing is just a beautiful treat to have with this keyboard.its 2 drawbacks: I wish there were more options for the OLED screen like on logitech keyboards. I think that's up to the software devs for the steelseries software to implement. And secondly, its a dog hair magnet which i feel is relatively unavoidable given the design.Overall, if you want a premium keyboard and have money to burn, get this keyboard. If you are trying to save your wallet and ARENT a highly competitive gamer who needs every millisecond advantage over the enemy, Don't get this keyboard.",

The switches are silent but satisfying to type on for those who are living with someone who doesn\u2019t care for clickity clacking but still wants a premium typing experience. The small LED screen and audio switch button are surprisingly useful for someone who switches between headphones and speakers a lot. Overall a great keyboard that\u2019s holding up well, would recommend!",
          "I bought this for my son in April 17  2022 after doing considerable research. It\u2019s now Dec 7th and the keyboard is dead. He\u2019s not rough on his tech equipment. I now can\u2019t justify buying another expensive keyboard as they obviously don\u2019t last. I\u2019m sick of us living in such a disposable society where products now don\u2019t even last a year. I do not recommend this product as it only lasted slightly less than 8 months.I had to change my review as the company was great about helping us find a solution. The keyboard is working again.",
          "Very cool, recommende",
          "I always like Steelseries. I use the sensei mouse, the qck pad, as well as V7 keyboard. When I have to replace the old keyboard, I chose steelseries apex pro without hesitation.Altough this item is a used one, but it is clean and well wrapped, like a new one. I enjoy it very much.",
          "I liked the keyboard, but couldn't adjust sensitivity of keys enough for me not to have a few additional keystrokes.  Everything else was great.  Only returned due to the above mentioned nuisance and previous history of faulty products from SteelSeries.",
          "So I decided to spoil myself and go high with my budget when getting stuff for a gaming pc (still in progress) and when it came to peripherals, I decided to go with something rated high amongst the gaming community.This keyboard is very nice. I was skeptical as I didn't know if i would consider investing heavily into something for gaming competitively especially with all the options that this keyboard gives you.But I really wanted to dive right in and see what the hype was. I wasn't disappointed as everything feels comfortable and the fact that you can customize the keys depending on what you're aiming for is a nice added touch.Also, it should be noted that downloading the software for this keyboard is a must. Especially with needed firmware updates and more options to customize how you want the lighting system to function. It was fun toying around to see what I could do. And the magnetic attachable palm rest is comfortable and can be removed if you don't care for it.HOWEVER,Keep in mind that if you want to spend this kind of money on a keyboard, that you take the time to consider what you're getting out of it; I say this as I myself had the luxury of spending extra money and wanted to take advantage of its versatility which not everyone would have 100% interest in. If anything you're best to do your research and comparison if you feel that it's worth the money.Overall I recommend this keyboard if you're into deep customization.",
          "I'm on the fence with this keyboard, so I'm giving it stars down the middle to represent not bad, not great.First up the price. Well, it's not worth what I paid for by any means. I did keep the keyboard, so I can safely say that I wasted some $$ on this. Half the price would be more reasonable.Rest of the keyboard is about as others have reviewed. The colors and software you run (I'm on Win10x64) all work well and I've had no issues. I already owned a SteelSeries mouse, so there wasn't any additional setup for me on the software front. The keyboard showed up in their software and I was immediately able to start playing around with settings. As I expected, this is a rather clicky keyboard - if there were 5 or so clicking at the same time, you'd think you were in a news room. My previous keyboards were much softer touch and produced next to no sound, so the difference is a bit jarring at times. I'd tried to switch over to a more standard gaming keyboard several times over the past couple years and this is the latest attempt.There are a couple things I was disappointed in and one of them I guess was just ignorance on my part of what the thing does. First up, the software works like crap when you put it in the dual mode to keep colors in sync between a keyboard and mouse. Settings are suddenly limited to lowest common denominator, so if you have thoughts of doing this, forget it. Fairly easy to just set up each separately to kind of match.Second up is this adjustable pressure. Silly me, I thought it would actually adjust the pressure you \"could\" apply to the keys. Well, that's not the case. It's influences the amount of pressure you \"need\" to apply to the key to get it to see the key was pushed. On the lightest touch setting, just barely rubbing your finger across the key will trigger a push. And then on the highest setting, you have to push all the way down on the key. While this is supposed to be the big selling point of this keyboard, it's not that impressive. It does work as advertised, now that I understand the advertising. It just doesn't seem to make any difference in what I do at all. I've been PC gaming since the 2 color screen days, so I've used so many different keyboards, I can't count them all. This is just another one to me. I'm likely to never remember back and think \"holy button push\", that was a pivotal moment with this awesome keyboard!That said, this isn't a bad keyboard at all. I'm keeping and testing to see if my years of typing possibly change as I use it. I like the colors. I like the extra USB plug. I'm on the fence about the little wheel and useless screen in the upper right.If you've got $$ burning a hole in your pocket, go for it. If you're debating on spending this much for something and not sure if it's worth it, it's not.",
          "i have two main gaming systems i spent about 6k on each both were using (other brand) k95 keyboards, i had to replace one with one of their newer keyboards and after about a month 5 of the new cherry mx silvers its came with started to double press each time i pressed one,was not a problem with gaming as they were not in the wasd area but was hell to type with...this new board with these new switches are just amazing i can not recommend this keyboard enough if you want the best of the best,they feel a bit smoother then cherry mx switches but have about the same resistance but you can adjust the actuation point on them so that your barely have to touch them or make it so you need to bottom out good for typing,i tend to leave mine right in the middle and they are perfection.About my only gripe with this board is the little Oled screen on it its pretty much useless as it is,i mean it can be handy at times but you have to open the software each time you restart your pc and activate what app you want to run on it,i just wanted to leave it on GPU temp display..no such luck i have to open their software each time i want it to display that very annoying so i just stopped using that. i would just pretend it didnt come with that little screen and you'll be perfectly happy with the board.i have owned just about every mainstream keyboard you can get and this one takes the cake,give it a try you wont be disappointed.",
          "It works well, and the key are mechanical. I like the keyboard although it was a little pricy. I like the switches and hasn't given me any problems yet. Overall good keyboard if you have the money to spend.",
          "This keyboard is great. It's good for typing or gaming. The whole board feels well made and solid, I think it'll last a while. The dual USB (one connector for keyboard and one for USB passthrough) is a bit thick and stiff, but not unmanageable by any means.The programmable keys make a HUGE difference when going between typing and gaming, and with the Steelseries software it's extremely easy to set up. I went into it assuming the programmable keys were more of a marketing gimmick and never actually intended on adjusting them...but that changed when I realized that they're definitely a feature I'll use.The RGB is nice and bright and very customizable with the software. Lots of options for colors. Something to note, they board turns on/off keys white when active (caps lock, num lock, etc stay white when on). This confused me at first, I thought the LEDs in my NumLock key were broken because it stayed white. Definitely not an issue, but not a feature that's pointed out anywhere either.The OLED screen is the one part of the keyboard that I'll admit, while cool, is a bit gimmicky. It does have it's use for sure, like changing saved profiles without the software, but it's not necessary. It's a neat little addition that allows another level of customization, but I feel Steelseries could have left it off and made they keyboard $10 less or something. It gives the \"pro\" keyboard a premium feel, but seems wholly unnecessary once the \"neatness\" wears off.Overall it's a great keyboard, definitely a purchase I'm glad I made. If the board holds up, which I think it will, I'll definitely look into other Steelseries products in the future.",

          "I got this and a Rival wired mouse for my son\u2019s birthday.  He plays a lot of Roblox with his friends and I constantly hear him hammer fisting his desk in anger because his wireless keyboard and mouse would lag and make him vulnerable in shooter games.  He was so excited to get the keyboard and mouse.  Not only does it look super cool, but you can adjust the actuation of the keys.  You can make it so you barely have to touch the key, to fully pressing the key all the way down in order to send the command.  The keyboard feels like it's built to last, nice and sturdy, and has a real nice mechanical feel when typing.  I pop in every now and then when he's playing a Roblox shooter game with his friends and ask if the keyboard and mouse are working alright.  He always tells me they work flawlessly, in fact he said his click speed is a lot faster now.  I'm not gamer, but I understand your competition will kick your butt if you're playing with sub par tools.  It's been a week and I have yet to hear any angry hammer fisting of his desk.\ud83d\ude01  In fact, I was watching him play the other night when a Roblox YouTuber joined his server.  He got all excited  and said the person was one of the highest ranked players in the game he was playing.  He took out the YouTuber several times, but ultimately came in second to him each round until the YouTuber moved on.  My son was totally stoked and said there's no way he would have been able to compete with the old wireless keyboard and mouse.  Awesome, you don't always hit a home run with presents, but this might be one.  If only it would make him excited to do his homework.\ud83d\ude44",
          "I'll preface this review with my biases for it.  I got the keyboard because I'm shifting my computer time into digital art and the keyboard has to play nice with the Wacom tablet I have.  So the keyboard needs to be on the same level as the tablet.This keyboard is replacing a huge Logitech G-910 that has takes up a lot more desk area than this one.  The lack of dedicated Macro buttons might be a problem for some people, but honestly, I went from a Logitech G11 (with 18 macro keys) to the G910 and didn't miss the lack of dedicated macro buttons.  I doubt I will miss the lack of Macro buttons on this keyboard.  Also, the software for the SteelSeries does allow you to map any key to any function or macro.  So the Ins->PgDn keys could easily serve as macro keys.  Another thing to note is that most online games that I've played ban macros as cheating so they really aren't that necessary.Another feature of this keyboard I really like is that the palm rest is magnetic.  It almost seems like this was designed for my use case.  When I'm drawing with my Wacom I just remove the palm rest to make the keyboard nice and compact, and when I'm done with drawing for a while I just put it back.While most of the media keys (stop/play, forward, Reverse) are gone the volume wheel is still there.  This is probably the one feature on the G-910 that I would absolutely miss if I didn't have it on this keyboard.  It is smaller though, and it's not a free-running wheel so I think I prefer the one on my old keyboard better.The keys are raised above the bezel so they're easy to pull out if you're careful.  This will make cleaning the keyboard easier.  And with the software being able to map anything to anything you'd be able to switch the keyboard to Dvorak if that's your thing.Now for the things that drop the keyboard from a 5 to a 4 star.There is no light on the keyboard to tell you that the CAPs Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock are turned on.  This can be a problem when you're putting in passwords.  I haven't found it in the software, but there might be a way to set the illumination on those keys to be different depending on the state it's in.The keys also seem to be fairly loud to me.  It might just be that I started typing on a manual typewriter and I'm more used to pounding on keys a bit more than other people are, but I'm nowhere as heavy on the keyboard as some I've heard.  When I'm typing on this keyboard it seems awfully loud to my ears.I might update this review in the next few months if the keyboard fails for any reason.  I just hope it doesn't have the same illumination issue that plagued my G910.",
          "Going to keep this to a simple pros and cons list, although it is rather extensive.Pros-----\u2022 Typing feel is great. Similar to Cherry red.\u2022 Subjectively satisfying typing sound from bottoming out keys.\u2022 Adjustable actuation is a fantastic feature and helps working from home without swapping from a gaming keyboard.\u2022 Backlight looks fantastic\u2022 Software actually isn't all that bad. It gets the job done. Automatic profile switching has thus far been reliable.\u2022 Keyboard profile is small enough to not get in the way, unlike some competitors with extended frames and fluff.\u2022 Wrist rest is well made, ,magnetic attachment is convenient.\u2022 OLED screen controls double as limited media controls.\u2022 Not overly heavy.\u2022 Raised / exposed cap design makes it easier to clean.\u2022 Subjectively, it's just a very good looking product.Cons-----\u2022 Stock key caps are sub-par for a $200 product. Should have had PBT.\u2022 The proprietary switches don't always behave with third-party caps. I swapped out the caps for HyperX Pudding PBT caps and had to put O rings on my space bar and both shift keys to prevent them from getting stuck in a depressed position.\u2022 The OLED screen is next to useless, unless you don't want to use software profiles. It has some gimmick features, but I would have preferred to ditch it for dedicated lock LEDs or media keys.\u2022 No dedicated lock LEDs. Num, scroll, and caps lock are conveyed via the key switch LED, which can throw off your designs and the overall look of the board.\u2022 The scroll wheel and button for the OLED screen are very low quality. They feel stiff and are generally unsatisfying to use. The scroll wheel seems to hang up on some parts of the rotation and move more smoothly on others.\u2022 The keyboard feet are low quality and cheap, although 90% of people should not be using them, anyway. Using feet on keyboards forces you to bend your wrists, causing further strain, and I can't for the life of me figure out why so many people do this. Keyboard feet exist to allow you to see the keys better, which is something someone in the market for a $200 keyboard probably shouldn't have trouble with. Off topic...\u2022 The angle of the board is rather extreme while using the feet, so this problem is made worse.\u2022 The wrist rest, while well made, is also not very ergonomic. The angle at which it sits is necessitated by the very low profile it offers. A proper wrist rest should be flat and flush to the board and sit higher. It is also not long enough to accommodate my hands, but may be a better fit for someone with small hands. It is being relegated to a drawer and replaced with a soft, large rest.\u2022 The wrist rest has a soft texture but is still rather hard. This has pros and cons and is often a preference point, but it's usually a bad thing when the rest is poorly angled and fit to your hands, as you're dealing with added pressure and poor ergonomics.",
          "My most recent keyboard purchases have been two Apex Pro keyboards.  Both are functional and working nicely.  The screen is not so interesting, but the keyboard feel is tunable and good.  Software has worked fine under windows 10 pro.  I use custom key color sets of keys and then use a short fade on keypress.  That all works nicely.  I prefer this keyboard over the Corsair K95 Platinum.",
          "My grandson received this for his birthday and loves it. This is the heaviest key board I have ever lifted and can take the level of intensity a gamer typically uses. The color coding of the key board appears to be beneficial to the player per my grandson.",
          "This is undeniably the best keyboard I've ever purchased, This keyboard has one of the fastest response times I've ever seen. With near immediate response time, you can also adjust the actuation switches so that you barely have to push the key for it to register the press. This feature can take sometime to get used to but once you are used to it you'll never want to go back. I previously had the Razor \"Widowmaker\" Keyboard after using this keyboard for a few months the Widowmake just felt clunky and so unresponsive. If you're looking for a top tier keyboard for a decent price this is my go to. This keyboard makes bound and leaps in the direction of which all keyboards should be going. Not to mention it has RGB for any of you RGB lovers. 10/10 Recommend this keyboard, it improved my gaming life drastically.",
          "It's a nice keyboard, feels good when typing for extended periods of time and the led effects you can set on the key actuation look nice. I also like the little screen, but be careful that you don't put a static image there, I've already noticed some burn-in on the screen",
          "Great product, really quick delivery.",
          "I spent a lot of money on keyboards, and I tried all the expensive ones; I don't think there is any other keyboard that matches the performance and the convenience of this one, and without any exaggerations, this is the best keyboard money can buy, I will certainly use it for the next 7 years, and I will not think about keyboards anymore.",
          "This is an excellent keyboard. I have been using this for a few months now and the adjustability this keyboard has is a nice touch. I do not need to go into the software to change settings such as keyboard brightness and actuation distance. The display comes in handy and helps with the on-the-fly settings menu and the GIF integration is a nice touch. If you are worried about the two different kinds of keys, the omnipotent switches feel indistinguishable from the reds on the sides and all keys are very smooth. As a programmer, I am quite picky when it comes to keyboards and soured the internet for several weeks before buying this one and this does not disappoint.Only one complaint, it does not work well with all keycaps. I am using the Gskill crystal crowns and it does feel a little bit crunchy on some keys when bottoming out. The Omni point switches are a slightly different shape than the standard reds",
          "As with any 'gaming keyboard' software, the SteelSeries GG Engine is frustrating to use. Not as frustrating than Corsair's iQue software, and probably not as bad as Asus' Armoury Crate, but still not good.The keyboard itself it good, especially for gaming.",
          "I've been looking for a worthy replacement for my Logitech 810, a no-frills, mechanical, RGB keyboard with a relatively small footprint, and this SteelSeries Apex Pro is everything I need and nothing I don't.The finish is a pleasant feeling matte black which looks nice and doesn't show fingerprints. The edges are also rounded which makes using the keyboard on my lap more comfortable. Construction feels solid but the keyboard is relatively light weight and doesn't feel cumbersome to lift or move.I'm not an expert on switches but the keys feel really nice. I messed around a bit with the adjustable actuation software, and it's pretty cool, though I ended up sticking with the default setting. The lighting is lovely, bright, and sufficiently customizable. One feature about the lighting that made me want to buy this keyboard is that the SHIFT characters on the number row keys are illuminated. It's baffling how more expensive competing products fail to do that.The mini OLED screen on the keyboard is more or less worthless for practical real-world use, but it's aesthetically pleasing, and you can add your own image, so I'm not mad. I was concerned because one Youtube review described the OLED/media scroll and button as feeling cheap and flimsy, but I don't find that to be true.If I had to criticize anything, I'd say the footprint might actually be too small. There is practically nowhere to grip the keyboard if you have to pick it up. First world problems.",
          "I had the G810 for 6 years.  This new keyboard is superior in quality, sturdy, lighting, software, switches and the volume metal roller switch.  The small display works great, but not needed for me.  The exterior USB is great to have and the overall build quality feels great.  Nothing too shiny and nothing too dull.  Even the hand rest is magnetic with nothing to break.  The keys are the same layout as my last keyboard, but the foot print is much smaller with the same functions.  The underside is channeled to set the cord where you want it.  Some like it coming away from the keyboard on the left, right or center.  Well thought out.  I have no grips and I have not even begun to explorer all of the software apps for lighting and macros.  I liked it so much I got the Apex 5 wireless mouse.  I love ALL of it.",
          "The best keyboard ever. Quality product. An amazing gamers keyboard.  Worth every penny",
          "Works very well. I Had been using a BlackWidow Chroma from Razer since release till this board arrived. This board has some noticeable upgrades. The key caps have a splendid near rubberized feeling texture to them. The keys are far quieter and my friends in Discord have thanked me for it. The LED screen for custom logo/animations is frankly amazing- Such a cool brag feature. The media volume wheel worked without any setup and I don't know if I could live without it now. I'm not a sweaty enough gamer to play with accuation settings as the default has felt great anyway but I could see myself adjusting numpad for data entry to avoid any slips. At this price point I think braided cables would of been nice but I have not one bad thing I can say about this keyboard."

          "Again only for people who want to spend a little extra on their setup. Not saying it's not worth it but I've used just the tkl version without the actuation setting for over 2 years now and it works and feels the same. Being someone who uses the shift key alot it's nice to set it to a low actuation so that barely touching it activates caps or the sprint aspect in game. Works great I have no complaints",
          "this is a highly rated keyboard amongst gamers but damn is it loud when using the keys",
          "\u00a0I like this board a lot because of the RGB, the actuation point which you can change and even the OLED screen to display animations or messages. I had the first Apex pro which I liked and when I saw this I bought the newest one cuz why not but the reason I gave this board 4 stars is because of the software. When using the software to change the RGB's animation the animation stops for about 10 seconds and resumes which is a weird delay. Same with the OLED, stops and resumes after 10 seconds. But there is another thing about the animation on the OLED screen. Its play at a faster animation speed than the normal animation speed its supposed to play at. Other than the software with the board its a good board. A new cool feature it does have is a detachable USB-C cable. They did take out the extra USB slot which I don't care about but that is probably the only thing the removed from the first board. Wish I could give this 5 stars but until Steel Series fixes the software then I will probably update my review. Also the stabilizers on this board are good.(This is probably not a good review but I want to let buyers know about the issues I was having with this)8/10Update 10/19: I returned the wired version for the wireless version and all my problems are solved as in the RGB not being delayed and the OLED screen working normally. Is it worth spending the extra $64? That is for you to decide. I will give it a 9/10. I hope SS fixes these problems for the wired version in the future.",
          "I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and it is a very very lovely little thing. I get the urge to just go and tack away at it because it is so satisfying to use the keys.The .2mm actuation takes some getting used to, but provides a very prompt response to whatever you need to do in game, just be weary of accidentally hitting another key, but that gets better with practice. The on-the-fly adjustability of actuation makes switching from a game to writing an essay very quick.The cable it comes with is very robust, and long enough for any normal setup, and the connection is very stable.My big disappointment with this purchase is the LED issues. After about 10 seconds the LEDs just freeze for like 3 seconds, making any dynamic lighting unusable, but they are still very pretty when static. I assume this is a software bug that should get patched with time, but as updates roll around on Prism, nothing gets fixed.This falls just short of \"you get what you pay for\" as of now, but if the LED issues were fixed, this would be money I have zero regrets spending.",

          "This is a great keyboard, but definitely overpriced in 2022 at its MSRP and usual price. I would recommend it if you find it on discount!",
          "Right out of the box, the keyboard was good. Super easy to adjust keyboard settings without downloading software since you could do it on the OLED screen, easy to navigate. Wish it had a braided cable though. I was kind of surprised it didn\u2019t come with one.",

          "I don\u2019t like apps, and the keyboard needs one to do its thing\u2026.  Perhaps a necessary evil associated with RGB..  but at least try to get all your RGB stuff operating through a single app.That said, everything about this is a home run.  Infinitely configurable and we\u2019ll thought out design.  Feels good and sturdy.",
          "When it comes to this gaming keyboard, there really aren\u2019t a lot of negatives. Everyone says \u201cI hate how the cord doesn\u2019t detach\u201d but lets be freaking real. It is ridiculously easy to hide the cord behind a desk when attaching it to your pc/Xbox/ps4. I\u2019m convinced people are just lazy and don\u2019t know how to problem solve. The keyboard itself is easily the best feeling keyboard I have had. So many great features all packed into one great keyboard. The stock key caps are already pretty dang good, but I got the prism caps and it truly makes a difference. The lighting is so much brighter and the feel is even better than before. This is a must-have keyboard for gaming, as well as typing in general!",
          "I purchased the old Apex Pro TKL a few weeks before this new version was released, so I was able to return it to \"upgrade\" to the 2023 model. Here are my thoughts on the 2023 edition after having the experience of using both boards.Pros:- Detachable USB-C cable. The old model's enormous, non-removable cable was one of the worst qualities about it.- PBT keycaps. These definitely feel more premium than the ABS keycaps of the previous model.Cons:- Unlike the previous model, there is no onboard memory for RGB profiles. This means that if you want to customize RGB lighting, Steelseries software must be running on your PC at all times. This is a huge negative in my opinion and unacceptable for a keyboard that is this expensive.- Overall build quality feels worse than the previous model. Lots of key wobble, scroll wheel and button feel like cheap components compared to the previous model.In terms of gaming performance, I haven't noticed a difference between the two boards at all. Supposedly the \"Omnipoint 2.0\" switches are faster and have a lower possible actuation point, but they feel the same to me. I think the 2023 edition is a better feature set overall for the detachable cable / keycaps alone, but the poor feeling build quality and inability to customize RGB without always on software is really unfortunate considering the price of this keyboard.",

          "El producto cumple con todas las necesidades en juegos y es hermoso.Pero las keycaps son p\u00e9simas no dura mucho se gastan demasiado r\u00e1pido tube que comprar keycaps por aparte :(",
          "LEDs: They\u2019re good work well and have lots of customization to them can\u2019t go wrong with them only problem is I did notice on my full size after a few years of owning it one of the colors started to go out in my Left Alt button I believe blue went out on white the LED was a yellowish orangish color.Switches: These are very advanced switches if you\u2019re looking for something simple or tactile these aren\u2019t for you these have a nice feature I play with a lot witch is the actuation you can constantly change it to whatever suits your use case typing a lot? Turn it up to make sure you don\u2019t miss click anything. Gaming? Maybe turn it down to around 4 for more faster reaction time or possibly turn it up for more accurate movement? All personal preference but I love the ability to change it but if you\u2019re a settings person like me you may drive yourself crazy trying to find any excuse why you can\u2019t play correctly and spend more time messing with this option.Key caps: the original key caps work well had no issues on my full size with them used the for a long time with not a problem. However on my new keyboard this one the TKL I decided to opt for the Pudding Keycaps I noticed the ones listed for this steel series was going for around 30$ for the set and read a review just as this one that stated the hyper x caps were exactly the same with a hyper x space bar that costed almost half of that so I opted for the hyper x pudding caps and they work perfect no issues or complaints but they really don\u2019t do much other than appearance wise they look really clean with RGBs on.OLED Screen: I really don\u2019t even look at it I set a custom image on it and other than that it\u2019s just there for eye candyVolume Scroll Wheel: I will have to say it kinda sucks on my full size it got dust and whatever else trapped between it and the sensor / switch and caused it to completely work backwards turning it down turned it up and turning it up made it turn down very annoying but found online it said to blow between the scroll wheel like we used to do with game cartridges to clean them out and it started working correctly again but this is not a solution so far on my TKL I have not had this problem but it hasn\u2019t been very long I expect it to happen for sure other than that when it works correctly it\u2019s very nice and feels very good.Quality: Very good keyboard built sturdy and does not feel cheap it\u2019s not all metal it says there is some but it all does look like plastic but it does feel very solid compared to other cheaper keyboards I\u2019ve used.Value: Now here\u2019s where it gets tricky I bought this purely based off wanting something I was comfortable with but I am aware there\u2019s a lot of other options most likely even cheaper with just as good quality but I will say this much this one is packed full of options you most likely won\u2019t find on others. So if you like complex and lots of features and options/settings this is the one for you if you don\u2019t then why are you even looking at this product?",

          "I recently purchased the wired version and I returned it due to me having problems with the software as in the RGB freezing and the OLED screen freezing and playing a fast animation on the screen than a normal speed. So I returned it and spent an extra $64 for the wireless version and all my problems are solved. No more RGB freezing and the OLED screen works. I did own the first Apex pro tkl board which is my favorite stock board to this day. Now they did remove the extra USB port which I don't have a problem with. Also if you are wondering, you can attach a cable Via USB-C and play the board wired instead of wireless. Overall good board and good connectivity for gaming.

          "If you are like me and looking at this board, you may be getting frustrated at how hard it is to find that nearly perfect board that should exist, when you're willing to drop over $230.Pros:- Omnipoint switches work as advertised -- if you like super fast response time, you can't beat these. These switches also have excellent bounce and no ping.- PBT keycaps are nice, and switch cross-stems are compatible with a lot of after-market keycaps. Overall a solid thock.- Unlike other small wireless boards (ahem Logitech G915 TKL...), this has no rattle- Very light and quite compact even among TKLs, makes for a good portable board in a TKL case.- The volume wheel is very satisfying.Cons:- Firmware issues, firmware issues all around. There are some updates available, but even with it, the battery indicator is botched. My first piece would refuse to charge (as far as I could tell) until it was nearly drained. The second unit charged, but the battery indicator would be all over the place based on what was going on, ranging from 30% to 80% within a 4 minute span! Which is accurate? Who knows.- Also, the battery life kinda sucks. Typically lost over 50% charge with moderate LED lighting in 5-6 hours of use with an aggressive sleep timer set. Other boards lose barely 15% with this amount of usage.- The keyboard doesn't wake up very fast, and it doesn't register the keypress you used to wake it up. Leads to missed keystrokes often, especially if you set a low sleep timeout to conserve battery.- The only Caps lock indicator is the LED color of the key becomes white (which tbh is kinda blue, see below) when active. This is really hard to see quickly, and there is no option to use the superfluous OLED screen for this. Overall the OLED screen would have been better used for lock or battery indicator lights. This is kind of a big QoL issue for me that could be easily resolved with OLED firmware.- LEDs are kinda off. Blues are too strong, reds very weak, and have heard of folks having issues with LEDs dying, with no easy repairability.- Despite how nice the switches are, they don't feel as good as gasket-mounted/dampened switches. The spacebar is a huge offender, with no stabilizers it is jarringly louder than every other key, but is one pressed quite often so it makes you sound like a really bad drummer. It's hard to not compare this board to others at this price point that sound way better (see: ROG Azoth).- The USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter is quite chonky as far as transmitters go these days (again, see ROG Azoth). This makes it project a good bit from your computer, making for a prime cable-snagger. On top of that you likely need a USB-A adapter or extension cable, which is one more component that is a failure point, takes up space and hampers portability. There's also no dock in the keyboard for them (which they could have easily accommodated) for portability.The cons list outnumbers the pros by just a little bit much for a $200+ keyboard, hence why I returned it. Ultimately the ASUS ROG Azoth was the first and only $200+ board to check the features I wanted while having fewer cons than pros. Still, the Apex Pro TKL is a clear second, with some advantages that might tip the scales in its favor if those are more important to you.",
          "My \"U\" keycap caught the switch on the way down. Fixed it by taking a Dremel and grinding out some plastic inside the keycap and putting o-ring dampeners on all keys. I mainly did the o-rings to make the travel distance shorter, but it did also help with the \"U\" key. May have tried to swap it out with another copy if it wasn't an easy fix. Shouldn't have to deal with cheap keyboard problems at this price point. Case ping (for those who may not know, this is the ring you hear when a key bottoms out) is noticeable when using the space bar in a quiet environment. Overall sound is still good though. OLED screen is fun to play with. Omnipoint switches feel extremely smooth, and I love how high you can set the actuation point. You barely have to touch them before they register, which is great for gaming and mildly annoying for general use. Thankfully, you can have different profiles with different actuation points for each. Would like to be able to create animations with the per-key lighting like Logitech allows. Would have been nice to have the Omnipoint switches on all keys, but they are on all the important ones. The plain reds on the other keys are a little scratchier, but not bad. Basically on par with the other optical reds I have on my 60% board. Overall, the Apex Pro is the best keyboard for gaming I've owned (out of 5) despite its flaws. DO NOT pay full price for it. It's not worth $180. The performance increase is at best barely noticeable over much cheaper competition. QC also wasn't perfect. There are definitely a lot of better deals out there, though I will still keep this mainly for the Omnipoints. It would be an even better board if it were 65%, which IMO should be the standard for gaming. TKL and full-size boards can get in the way of your mouse if you play on low sensitivity and use a lot of your arm. I'd get a 65% or 60% board with linear optical switches (I use reds, but heard good things about yellows) over this if you're not sure about it. Maybe another TKL if you're concerned about the F keys. The money you save would be better spent on a good mouse.",

          "I like the way the keyboard sounds it isn't too loud or quiet the RGB can be changed to many things using the software which is also the pretty good only thing I disliked about it was the hand-rest picked up dust kinda easily but isn't a big issue.",
          "Explanation of my photo before the important part of the review: The x key puts out the wrong color after about 2 years of ownership. The whole keyboard is set to white, but x is putting out a greenish color.Important part: You can go to all the other reviews to learn what is so perfect about this keyboard, so I will not explain details. Well, as perfect as this keyboard was, after about 2.5 years, it has magically started dying on me. It\u2019s hard to really pinpoint what is going on but the keyboard is bugging out and having inputs go into my pc randomly. Even though I have made it go away for a bit by spamming the keys which I thought were the ones being inputted, my keyboard is just not okay to use anymore. I\u2019m bummed because I came to check this order which I made 2.5 years ago and I find that the customer support window for my order has closed 7 months ago.At this point I know they have the new gens out so I don\u2019t think people need to be looking at this version anymore, I\u2019m just writing this review out of how bummed I am about my keyboard. Deep down inside I wish SteelSeries could reach out to me with a replacement.",
          "I am very satisfied with my purchase of the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Mechanical Gaming Keyboard! This keyboard is a real find for gamers and anyone who types a lot. It is very comfortable and pleasant to the touch, with soft and smooth key strokes.I am also very pleased with the ability to adjust key sensitivity using the OmniPoint magnetic sensors.This allows me to precisely tailor the key presses to my needs, which has noticeably improved my performance in games and when working with text. Overall, I highly recommend this keyboard to all gamers and anyone looking for a quality mechanical keyboard for work.",
          "So far this keyboard has been very good for me. I type a lot as well as game, and being able to switch profiles depending on what I\u2019m doing is great. As the actuation point can be adjusted, it takes a bit of messing around to get it how you like it. Build quality seems very good. I\u2019d recommend replacing the keycaps with PBT keycaps for a better feel. My only complaint, and it\u2019s more of a minor issue is the USB cable is THICK. Almost annoyingly so. It doesn\u2019t sit well on the desk, and gets in the way. I\u2019d prefer either a detachable USB C cable or something smaller and braided. I have several mechanical keyboards with USB pass through and this is by far the largest USB cable on any of them.",
          "This keyboard is amazing. Would suggest it for anyone who uses a regular cheap keyboard. It really is super fast I suggest turning the actuation point up to 1 once you get it though",
          "I've owned the Apex Pro TKL for about two years. It's been a wonderful board and my daily driver for gaming. The omnipoint switches sound really nice and the OLED screen is a nice addition for information for your game and computer as well as silly GIFs. My only main critique is the fact that the omnipoint switches aren't available throughout the entire board and some of the keys LED's did end up having discoloration due to having the keyboard for such a long time. Great keyboard, would recommend it to anyone willing to pay the price.",

I have tried various keyboards and brands and the Apex Pro TKL is the best keyboard you will ever try.Switches: The switches on this keyboard are buttery smooth and require no need to lubricate them because they feel like they already are. This keyboard has EXTREMELY fast switches and is great for gaming and especially any FPS games. The letters and numbers at the top of the keyboard are a switch that no other keyboard has, which is Omni Point adjustable Mechanical Switches. They are a white in color and can be adjusted by the OLED display menu at the top right of the keyboard or in the SteelSeries software.OLED Display: The OLED display is a little screen at the top right corner of the keyboard which has some cool little functions that you can use to adjust the keyboard without having to open up the software. It gives you options to adjust things like the actuation which is the point at which the key registers so you can change how far you have to push the key down before it registers. You also have options to change the brightness of the rgb and you also have some of the basic options for the different rgb settings.RGB Lighting: It has very customizable rgb settings in the software. You can change anywhere from one key to the whole keyboard with different effects. Some of the basic settings are colorshift, single color, gradient, and the breath effect. Anything that you would want to change as far as rgb, you can do.Feel and Durability: The way this keyboard feels is like no other and has a nice and strong feel while it\u2019s not too heavy or too light. The durability is very good on this keyboard and I have had it for over a year and it feels the exact same as when I first bought it.Overall Review: This keyboard is a little pricey for some but you get what you pay for and in my opinion this keyboard is best of the best from the performance of the keyboard and the way it feels, to the variation of rgb lighting and with the OLED display like no other keyboard has is very convenient and is also customizable.",
          "Let's start with the bad. The thick keyboard cable ticks me off. It makes moving the keyboard around frustrating at times. Who needs the USB pass? The lcd is really small to be useful. Just a little more real estate goes a long way. How much more for color add better resolution etc... Keycaps are crappy. I will replace those and now that good. It's really quick and I end up using it for most everything. My huntsman te has started gathering dust. I game with this half the time and I type a bit in it as well. I have dedicated keyboards for different tasks. This one is turning into the one keyboard to rule them all. If it came with better keycaps and a single regular detachable USB cable then it would be really really good.",
          "Super fast switches, great for comp gaming overall just a great keyboard.",
          "This looks great in my sons room. Lights are bright and looks amazing. Highly recommend.",
          "Let me start off by saying this is a great keyboard, build quality is superb.  All the problems with it could be fixed I believe, but currently it's half baked at best.  The ESC key being green while it's plugged in is annoying, even more so when it's blinking as it charges.  The caps lock indicator just makes the C key super bright which looks dumb.  Why wouldn't you just have the caps lock key light up?  The real issue is you can't save on-board profiles, so when you switch to bluetooth you are stuck with unicorn vomit since the on-board defaults are all terrible.  Like you just can't have 1 on-board profile that's a solid color...seriously.  No way to change it in the OLED display menu either, when the wired version has those options, doesn't even make sense.So I have the wifi adapter plugged into my laptop and the keyboard attached to my main system through the USB-C.  Swap to USB, then swap back to wifi, guess what, you are still typing on whatever it's attached to though USB, completely ignoring that it's in wifi mode.  You must have their software running if you want set any custom RGB other than the unchangeable on-board unicorn vomit.  When the keyboard goes to sleep mode, you can't activate it unless whatever machine you have it plugged into though USB is turned on, even in wifi or bluetooth modes.  Even then, I was having to unplug it and plug it back in for it to light up and work.If you don't mind running their junk software and you are only using it on 1 machine, the keyboard is super well built and a thing of beauty, although skip the wireless and just go for the standard version IMO.  Until they fix all the glaring flaws, stay away from this one.  $250 for this thing is absurd in it's current condition.  If this was my company, the people responsible for the software/firmware decisions would be fired immediately, it's literally that bad.",
          "I've used most of the top rated keyboards before like the Steelseries M750, Razer Blackwidow v2 (green and brown switch models) and the Razer Huntsman (red optical). Just those three are well respected keyboards and get a lot of praise for how it is they are built and what they offer.I've played FPS games for years now so I tend to notice and look for if a new tech product gives me an advantage in my gameplay. Besides that I'm also a full-time engineering student so I find myself typing reports frequently. The switches in this are linear so they don't have a tactile click or bump but instead a smooth keystroke. This is perfect for fps shooters as it allows for faster and better feeling key presses.I tested this keyboard in all my favorite shooter games, the main one I play is Apex Legends. While games like Valorant are more Aim heavy, Apex is a movement heavy game so you are using your keyboard more than your mouse at times. The lowest Actuation setting which is 1 (0.4mm) is very nice for those quick movements, pulling up your Heals/shield wheel and throwable wheel on Apex Legends.The OLED screen is a really cool feature and actually allows you to change settings without the Steelseries Engine application. Settings like Brightness, actuation, macros. Plus you can have custom messages as the main screen on the display. I've seen that it even connects to some games and displays your Kills/Deaths/Assists for games like CS:GO.In terms of my reports, Actuation setting 1 might be too responsive to some. For me perosnally I up this to 5 so I don't tend to mistype as much and it really does help. The Overall build is really good. I do wish steelseries used Braided cables but it's not a huge deal breaker for me. I've got to say, Steelseries made a Keyboard to suit my school and gaming needs.Not only that but it's an attractive keyboard and I always get complements and asked what keyboard I have every time someone sees my setup. I did also replace the standard key caps with White ones from HK Gaming.So is it worth getting the Apex Pro? personally, Yes.The price is a bit high for people and i agree it is. But what you get compared to other keyboards such as the adjustable actuation points, the OLED screen, and volume dial make it my top pick in keyboards.Steelseries have done a great job making a very attractive and nice looking keyboard. I already own a full-size Apex Pro but I needed a second one for a second setup. When it came to buying a second keyboard I was looking at every option available.I usually tend to want to get something new or different but I couldn't seem to find a keyboard that looked or sounded better than the Apex Pro personally. The overall keyboard is just so good and so fun to use and I'm sure if you are on the edge of buying it or fear of not liking it, give it time and you'll appreciate this keyboard a lot.This isn't a keyboard that you have to get used to but a keyboard that grows on you. I hope this helps!",
          "The main competitor to this keyboard in my opinion is the G715. I ended up buying the G715 and returning this keyboard. The G715, felt superior connection wise and overall performed better for my purposes.Pros:- Switches felt great- The double actuation thing, though niche can provide amazing flexibility- OLED screen is by far amazing aesthetically- Connection via 2.4ghz, bluetooth to mutliple devices and usb- Build quality feels greatCons:- When waking up, it would take 1-3 seconds to wake up. This means when you press any key, on wake up, you will end up missing a few key strokes. This was infuriating as a software developer as the keyboard would sometimes sleep as I am working. Then a few keystrokes will be missed as I am writing my code. This completely interrupts my train of thought.- Colors felt washed out while compared to an Apex Pro- Missing entire row of keys (print screen, lock, pause break). Not a big deal for probably 99% of users but when you use linux, lock and pause/break is useful. I understand the OLED screen covers the area but I missed those keys.- Updating firmware is a big pain in the ass. You have to disconnect and reconnect both dongles/keyboard multiple times before the GG software recognizes both peripherals. Also, sometimes the firmware updater doesn't launch correctly.- Battery life was inconsistent. I have a kvm switch between my mac and pc. On one machine the GG software would display 70% battery life and the other 95% battery life. Which one is correct? I am not sure.",
          "I was initially put off because I am not a huge fan of the whole light up keyboard with flashy lights concept (lol) but ended up placing function above all else once I realized it has the ability to not be all rainbow-y. No regrets, I freaking love it. I was using blue switches prior and I do not plan on going back. Very quiet, comfortable, and the individualization is truly the best part. Being able to personalize everything both internally and externally really does make a difference.",
          "Pros: the keys and sound while typingThe software is very user friendlyIt\u2019s a wireless version of the apex proThe cons for me are the same reasons I don\u2019t use my apex pro full sized except the for the sleep mode it has.Cons: my hands are big and the included wrists rests are magnetic so when I put enough weight on one side the included rests pop up.I thought that the keyboard would have been a lower profile so I would not have had the use the wrist rests.The #1 reason is the idle sleep when not typing, I have to actively hit a key for it to wake up then type. On my Logitech 915 wireless I\u2019ve never had to do that. It\u2019s beyond annoying and wish there was a fix for it beyond never letting the keyboard sleep. Idk when you buy a wireless version of anything all these days the consumer should feel like it\u2019s the exact same as a wired version, this would have been acceptable in 2010ish but now days not good, I don\u2019t know how they could have over looked this. Multiple times already I\u2019ve entered in data not looking at the monitor gone back looked it over because the numbers weren\u2019t right and it\u2019s the idle mode, it didn\u2019t register the first keystroke, I cannot risk a job because a keystroke didn\u2019t register because of a basic huge design flaw. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll fix this with firmware updates etc, but as of now this keyboard for me is a no go.",
          "This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. He\u2019s a video game enthusiast and knows a good product.",
          "I absolutely love everything about this keyboard.  It replaced the POS Corsair K95 that never worked right from the git-go.  The adjustable keys and downloadable control panel are awesome.  Highly recommended.  I'll never buy another Corsair product.  Their Ironclaw mouse sucked, too.  Replaced it with a 13-dollar cheapo that works great.",
          "The SteelSeries keyboard software is, hands-down, the best keyboard customization app I've ever used. I've never seen an app that makes it so simple to customize lighting effects, key binding, macros, profiles, and everything else. A++ for app design.The keyboard itself is built very well, and I like the simple design. It has a nice thick cable that can be routed out the back of the unit in the center, left, or right position, which makes it compatible with just about any desk layout. The footprint of the keyboard is only as big as it needs to be; the chassis barely sticks out past the keys, which is great for fitting it onto desks with limited space. Mine sits in front of a DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel, which takes up way too much space on the desk, so having keyboard with a minimal footprint helps a lot.The keys feel much different than other mechanical keyboards I've used. I'm used to feeling the click of the switch, but in this case the key travel is smooth -- very smooth -- with a satisfying sound that is neither too loud or too soft, but just right. But of course, we all know that keyboard feel is subjective, so you will just have to try it out for yourself!I highly recommend the SteelSeries Pro keyboards; I'll likely end up putting them on all of my machines.",
          "Honestly one of the best keyboards I've owned, it sounds amazing and feels even better If I had to I would definitely buy this keyboard again.",
          "overall keyboard feel is amazing, wrist support is comfortable, and very good for a gaming keyboard",
          "Amazing tech. While having no tactile indication when the keys actuate due to complete linear feel until the keys bottom out, the level at which they can activate is adjustable (and awesome) through software or the keyboards OLED screen. It takes getting used to, but not a long time. They are feather light, so anyone who types A LOT will like that, and your fingertips will too. Key caps are decent, not too thick or thin. I have a compressed median nerve that causes pain all day sometimes in index, middle finger, half of ring finger and thumb. Anyone with carpel-tunnel will relate. This keyboard let's me enjoy typing and even gaming without even thinking about my hand! Except to think about how I'm not thinking about it.. While other keyboards may do that, Im still happy with this one. It's hard to tell, but typing sound is unique, and satisfying. All based on the materials and key cap shape/thickness. The frame is solid, no flex when applying pressure (sturdy). Like you know you bought something worth something.Lights are very bright. I keep RGB on lowest setting most of the time. But I also got the pudding key caps to mix n match with the stanfard ones.Software is better than G Hub (Logitech). Wait, that's not saying much. I love Logitech mouses! But it still leaves something to be desired (an update maybe). Have to edit this, it's still the best software I've used.The wrist rest that comes with is impressively comfortable, considering it's not some squishy or beanbag style one.The weak point is preference.. if you like to customize, the switches are soldered to PCB, the LEDs can get on the way of custom key caps (any off brand like hyper x) and cause sticking or just not fit. Any cleaning upkeep will be limited to an aircan and some rubbing alcohol. If you're looking for something with that flexibility, then try for a Drop ALT or DROP CTRL (entry level 60% keyboard type stuff) that won't break the bank. If you've never experienced other keyboard switches and how they feel, check out a best buy or any place with keyboards on display, get an idea of what you may want before pulling the trigger. If you cant get to a place like that, there's videos on YouTube that offer great reviews (some more bias than others). I almost went with the Razor brand myself, but I'm totally more than happy with this purchase. And in keeping with the silly tradition of matchmaking, I needed a keyboard that matched my $10 steelseries cloth mousepad. (Seriously, Logitech still makes the best mouses, double clicks n all).If this keyboard stands the test of time (like maybe 8 months or something) I'll give it 5 stars. Boom, done! Reviews are sometimes fun. Shoulda done it on my Apex pro TKL instead of dumbphone, ugh.",
          "If you don't care about RGB customization and saving custom profiles, this keyboard is great.  However, the profile/configuration system is very buggy at the moment.  I've run into a bug where certain keys can't be selected to change RGB colors or style.  Also, any changes made on the 5 profiles won't update on the desktop PC software or will completely reset.Also, i can't save custom RGB profiles to the keyboard. I have to be connected to the GG software or it will default to the factory RGB profile.There's a lot to like with the feel of the keys/switches while gaming and typing but with the buggy software, many of the features that should be a selling point are not worth it especially on a keyboard at this price.",
          "I love this keyboard, and playing games with this keyboard makes my experience better.",
          "The feel and sound and build quality is top notch. My favorite feature has to be the adjustable actuation point. I've had keyboard that were too sensitive and would cause accidental touches. Able to adjust on the fly is huge. The built in software is awesome as well. You don't need to download their software on your pc if you don't want to. There's plenty to customize just in the oled screen alone. The media controls are all on top using the scroll wheel and main button to play/pause, skip, go back, and of course volume. Upgrade the keys and the rgb will be even brighter and it's easy to change. The magnetic pad is glorious as well it feels so soft even though it's rubber. Trust me on thos keyboard, its worth it.",
          "First off everything besides the RGB/Software on this keyboard is fantastic. Lets get that out of the way.Also let it be known that I am on my SECOND Apex Pro TKL 2023 edition and they both had this annoying issue.If you have any intentions of actually using the RGB I would wait until Steel Series issues some sort of update for this keyboard/Steel Series GG (not sure where the issue lies as customer support was only sending canned responses to return the keyboard and no answers on the issue itself)THE ISSUE: The RGB patterns you select to run on a loop will randomly freeze about every 5-10 seconds and then resume again. The actions you select the keys to perform when pressed will also freeze in the same intervals. When you really ramp up the actions that the lights perform it will freeze even MORE frequently.While it may seem ridiculous to be upset about the RGB of all things, it wouldn't be such a huge deal if the thing didn't cost $200. Its a bit unreal that this keyboard launched in 2022 at that price point and has an RGB issue... Just want to let others know what they are getting into before dropping $200 on an underwhelming and laggy light show.If you don't care about RGB this thing is all you could ask for in a gaming keyboard!*I will try and edit this review if there is ever an update that fixes this issue but for now ill hold on to it in the hopes that Steel Series will address it*",

          "I did lots of research before purchasing this keyboard and got a great deal here on Amazon for it. It's a beautiful keyboard with some wonderful features. The display is very cool and the keys making typing so easy and smooth. The lighting is gorgeous and fully adjustable. I wanted so badly for this keyboard to just work, but here's the issue that forced me to return it:If you want to use this keyboard with a usb switch (kvm-style) on any machine with a Win 10 OS, look elsewhere! I just could not get it to work consistently. It will work on Win 10 for a while, then it will start blinking, which renders it unusable. I had to switch it back and forth to make it stable again, but it wouldn't last. I tried a few different tricks I tracked down online including direct connection (which is definitely not a long-term fix, since I need to use it on the home and work PCs--  One of which, being Linux, worked flawlessly), changing power settings in Windows, and disabling the Steelseries software app, but nothing worked for more than a few minutes under load.Such a great keyboard--  I sure hope they work out these issues one day because I'd love to try it again sometime, but for me, I need the primary purpose of the keyboard to just work every time.I have nothing but praise for Amazon who talked this over with me and resolved this for me. So glad I bought this here. I'll be buying an alternative keyboard through Amazon, as well, with even more confidence having had such a good experience come out of this unfortunate situation.I've settled for the Razer Blackwidow Elite, which is nice from a typing perspective, but requires the proprietary software for lighting effects (where the Apex does not) and is not on the same level of solid quality as the Apex, nor are the switches as smooth, but it will do for now. I'm going to keep an eye out for the next Apex from Steelseries in hopes that it will not have the same issue with Win 10 that the 7 has. I still believe Steelseries makes the best overall gaming keyboard and look forward to trying it again someday.",
          "It's the best keyboard I've ever owned. Usually I would buy Razer I felt like after the years I wasnt getting much more in upgrades and their software would interfere with my gameplay. After searching for hours this was my final choice and wow it's amazing! So many options to customize and being able to change profiles thru the OLED screen, RBG and will customization, macros, apps and everything I'm so impressed. But the only thing that was a bummer was my experience was that when I played music it won't display on the OLED screen unless you paid for an app they sponsor. Other than that it has it all and the key switches are perfect quiet but it's clicky.9.9/10",
          "After over a year and two months, the 'a' key stopped fully working. This is outside their warranty period and customer support couldn't help me. The key will randomly stop working and then spring back to life. I clean the board regularly and have never spilled anything on it, I did really like this board but having keys die this quickly from moderate use is highly concerning and enough to put me off recommending it.",

          "Great keyboard, the construction feels good and sturdy and the lights are very bright. The switches are very responsive and I find myself typing a tad too hard because I am not used to such light actuation pressure but I will relearn that eventually. The lighting is very bright and pleasing to look at, probably the brightest keyboard Ive had yet. The OLED, while a huge gimmick, is a very fun gimmick, and the media controls are very helpful.The biggest caveat is, these are not really CHERRY brown switches. They are crisper than real cherry Reds, I have another board to compare them too directly, but they are not clicky at ALL. There is essentially no tactile feedback to them. I cant imagine what the Red version is like. Its not worth returning and replacing. I think I like the rest of the keyboard too much without anything comparable, but if a clicky brown is the biggest feature for you, pass on this. They are relatively quiet though. Louder than red but not annoying. A bit of a *THOCK* sound.",

          "I'm going to continue to use this keyboard because it's good for gaming. But for typing it's not so good, bad even. I constantly have extra letters pop up, and the tactile feel is very very low. It's very clicky though, but the response of seeing a letter pop up and the sound of the click doesn't match up every time. This is not a keyboard for typing.The keys feel kinda wobbly on their posts and the caps wiggle a little. For the price of this keyboard it should feel more put together and it doesn't.The LED programmable window is purely for .gifs and doesn't do anything remotely useful other than look pretty.The scroll wheel volume control is nice.The button to control media is not programmable (at least through the windows app) and doesn't do anything useful that I can tell so far.The SteelSeries cap button is programmable but by default doesn't behave like nearly any other keyboard I've used, I'm used to that button being 'right click at cursor' like a mouse command. And it's only a function key to access alt keyboard commands until you program it correctly. It doesn't allow programming beyond some very basic functions.The app to program the keyboard when you try to save configs locks up when saving and when you try and close the program it says it's going to revert changes. But doesn't.The color programming is extensive, but nothing special. Every other keyboard brand does the same thing visually.The wrist rest is very nice though, it detaches and is magnetic. It is slightly matte and grips well. It feels soft but isn't.",
          "I haven't read the manual yet, so i haven't seen my choices of color modes yet. I bought it so I wouldn't have to get up and cross the room to turn on a light. Yes, I know, first world problems. Sometimes I get started on the PC when it is still light out. Then, suddenly, I need to type something and I cannot see the keyboard. This saves me from not being lazy (lol). The default color changing is okay, but I definitely want to get around to reading how to change it to a solid, not changing, pattern.  The volume control is a nice touch, but I won't be using it as my physical volume control on my speakers is within easy reach and faster.I recommend this one to someone looking for illumination without wanting to spend big money on individual key lighting options. granted, it would be nice to highlight specific keys, but it's not worth the money. this keyboard is worth the money. great illumination and solid, so it won't easily slide around form an accidental bump.",
          "Disclaimer: I originally received the package empty because someone stole the keyboard before it was sent to me. It was a frustrating situation, but Amazon customer service followed up with me and refunded me by the next day, which I was happy with. I ended up buying the same model with brown switches the next day from the steel series store, and ended up saving $20 on the original $170 priced blue-switch keyboard.It's got a nice feel to it with both brown and blue switches, and has good resistance, but I prefer the brown over the blue because the clicking was a bit too loud for my taste. I like the OLED Display for it being customizable and can display the settings as well. I like the wrist rest as well, the material is comfortable on the wrist, but dust and other small particles, tend to stick to it easily, but nothing that can't be easily wiped off.The things I don't like is that the caps lock is easy too accidentally press, since it doesn't have any space between the A or Shift key, which some might like, but I don't. Also, when turning the LED lights off, the passthrough port and the media control button of the top right do not turn off. This can be annoying if you have this in a bedroom.Overall, I do recommend this keyboard if the above issues are not a problem.",
          "I thought the K70 LUX and K70 RGB MK.2 were the best keyboards, but the magnetic wrist rest and the beefy top feet and brighter LED's makes this one even better.It is also more compact, which I like.Software differences - who cares? - the OLED - who cares? EDIT: 5 months later, I actually care a lot and the OLED is perfect for monitoring CPU/GPU temperatures.Cherry Speed (silver) are good, but this is the best Cherry Red keyboard I have owned.",
          "My first gaming keyboard. Did a ton of research, tried out a ton at local gaming stores and went through with the SteelSeries Apex 7 Full. Sound is great, not too loud. Great keying feel. The RGB is cool too",
          "Used this product for two years. Loved this product for two years. Then key switches started failing. At first, it was just the \"s\" key. I cleaned it. It worked fine. Then it started to spread to more and more keys. Not all keys. Just some keys at random intervals across the board. If I cleaned them with Isopropyl Alcohol, they would work again for a bit, and then the issue would return a few days later. The issue was double-pressing and/or failure to capture keystroke. Just a failure of the switches. Support told me it was software-related. Walked me through resetting the board, reinstalling drivers, etc. I had already done these things, but I did them again. No dice. Then I was informed that due to the 1-year warranty, I was out of luck. I bought a different brand of keyboard. Worked immediately. I am typing this on that keyboard now. No issues. And to think I used to waste my breath telling my friends, family, and clients about how much I liked my Steelseries keyboard. 160 bucks for 2 years is not the type of return on investment I'm interested in.

          "I ended up going with the Apex 7 Brown version of the keyboard. I was coming from a Logitech G510 rubber dome keyboard.After using it for a while, I've noticed a few things:The keys are a little bit higher, so my hand sits at a slightly different angle than I've been used to for almost a decade; so that has been an adjustment. I never used the G510 wrist rest, and I currently don't have it on the Apex 7. I may need to start though because it does compensate a little bit for the shift in key height.Despite the description of the keyboard, the \"tactile/quiet\" doesn't quite accurately describe the sound. Playing games can be quiet if you're only using a smaller subset of the keys (WASD type deal) and press them less frequently, but if you are typing fast (or even average speed), the keys are noticeably louder than the rubber dome keys. I'd say so much louder that I cant imagine the clicky keys on the blue is much louder when typing. My wife has complained about the loudness of my typing now that we share an office.In terms of key feel, I really like it compared to the rubber dome. I wouldn't say it is similar in feel by any means though. It takes less force to push a key down, but because it feels less \"mushy\" I feel like my typing is more precise. If you were to go with the clicky blue version, I'd say you'd get more of that \"key pressed\" feel you get on the rubber dome when you push past the force required to activate a key. On the brown switches, you can push a key slowly down and only feel a minor bump when activating the key.Having per-key color customization and profiles is a neat feature especially if you're going for A E S T H E T I C S on your build. Definitely an improvement over the G510 in terms of brightness and color definition.The inclusion of 6 macro keys is a nice carryover option from the G510, and I definitely didn't need 18 of those. Haven't really had an opportunity to use this feature yet, but it is nice that it is there.One feature I miss is having a clock on the LCD screen. I'd say that as of now, the LCD screen is useless for my purposes with the current app options available. I currently just have a gif on it and the screen serves no functional purpose. The only apps available for the LCD screen from steel series are games I don't really play, or visualizers I won't ever use. If you want a clock, or to display song info (from things like spotify), you're going to have to find someone that has made it and install it manually, or code it yourself.The volume slider is exactly as it was on the G510 and I'd say its even better since you get a little tactile bump each time you spin it. This is a feature I'm glad is exactly the same.The single play/pause/skip key under the volume wheel took a little bit of getting used to, but works as intended. The only negative I'd say is that unlike the G510, when you use the button to play/pause/skip and your monitor is asleep (but PC is still playing music in the background) it wakes your monitors up. The G510 buttons did not do this, and it is something I miss from that keyboard.Final thoughts is that this keyboard has enough features (that I wanted from my G510) to warrant the upgrade. It is a nice keyboard that should hopefully last me the next 10 years. The difference between brown and blue switches is probably just feel and not necessarily noise level (and the reds didn't interest me at all).",
          "I've always had Razer brand keyboards before this, starting out with an Ornata Chroma and then the Blackwidow V3. Unfortunately, my Blackwidow began to have issues with registering and muffled switches and their customer service didn't seem to know how how advise me on properly cleaning it more than what I'd already done, so I sought out a more knowledgeable friend than myself who had mechanical keyboard experience and this is the one he recommended to me based on what I wanted (RGB, clicky switches, and the ability to customize keycaps).The blue switches are incredibly precise, tactile and clicky (just how I like it, since I love auditory feedback when typing and gaming). The software driver for SteelSeries has a ton of customization options, and I was pleasantly surprised with all the options it gave as to lighting patterns, lighting responses to key presses, and more. The board itself and the cable feel sturdy and durable, and this is the first time I've liked and used the wrist rest that came with my gaming keyboards. It's a pleasant smooth material and doesn't hinder anything when gaming like the ones I've had in the past. I can now thoroughly enjoy gaming again :) a great board and absolutely worth every penny, I hope to enjoy it for years to come!",
          "\u00a0This keyboard exceeded my expectations. I play a lot of different games for long sessions including mmos so I needed a keyboard that was going to give me more feedback than the one I was currently using. I decided to try out this steelseries one because I am a huge fan of their mouse lineup. This keyboard exceeded my expectations.Pros:- I got the blue keys so they are very clicky and tactile which I love. You can feel an instant press.- The rgb lighting is bright but not too bright with a ton of customizable options- Font on the keyboard is large and easy for me to read- The OLED screen isn\u2019t too extravagant but being able to add a cute little gif is a plus in my book- The scroll wheel by the OLED screen is great for easy volume control- I am a num pad user and despite this keyboard being full sized it\u2019s perfectly compact and organized without too much spacing- the keyboard is metal and very firm, this will not bend or break easily at allCons:- the wrist rest is comfortable but definitely not plush. It could take some getting used to.- the wrist rest is also rubber and a fingerprint magnet- cord is thick but not braided",
          "First, this keyboard is worth every single penny. I would have given it a 5 star but one of the magnets came out from the wrist support thing. I super glued it back in. Definitely nice, no complaints. I would purchase another one of these and my son has a glorious keyboard and I would put this keyboard against his in a heartbeat lol.",
          "When it works. It's an amazing keyboard. The back-lit RGB is fully customizable through the steelseries app that you install to your PC.However, I have had software issues with this keyboard where the keyboard is completely unresponsive from keyboard to PC. It will respond on the keyboard with the flashing lights that typically ripple or flash when typing a key.This issue has happened with both my initial purchase and the warranty replacement that i have received within a year of purchase. SteelSeries customer support is extremely helpful, but tend to be delayed to respond. I really wish I could give this a 4 star or higher. But the ongoing issue with this keyboard has made it impossible to use after 6 months of use.",
          "Updating my review after 8 months of use. Aug 13th, 2021After getting use to the feel of the keys I have come to realize this is the best keyboard I have ever owned.  This is comparing it to my Corsair K95 Platinum XT keyboard, my Razer BlackWidow, and my Logitech 710+.The ability to adjust the actuation of the key, the actual action of the keys, and the lack of noise when typing cannot be beat. You do not have the traditional mechanical feedback but it is obvious when a key actuates. I have never mistyped due to lack of tactile feedback.The ability to adjust when each of the primary keys activates it fantastic. When I game I rest my finger a little harder on the A key than the WSD keys. To compensate for this I simply changes the activation setting on the A key. Problem solved.They keyboard is very responsive. I do not feel like I have to type any differently on this keyboard vs any of my others.The lack of noise is great for working from home and when on comms for gaming.The ability to switch between profiles directly  that not only controls lighting but the key settings is great. I can work all day and then at the end of the day switch profiles directly from the keyboard is great.Yes, you may get a keyboard that is broken but if you can handle dealing with the return it is worth the trouble.The bad.The frame is aluminum so they must have a piece of ferrous metal inside the frame for the magnetic wrist rest to attach to. On my KB there is no ferrous metal on the left side so only the right side attaches. Frustrating.I picked the brown switches. They are defiantly quieter but feel like chicklet keys. Almost zero mechanical feedback to let you know the key actuated. This is after using reds for the last few years.The OLED display is basically useless since it sits flush with the KB. It needs to be raised at least a 1/2\" to really be useful.The good.The form factor is compact but still has a number pad.The KB feels well made. I expect it it to last a long time.The software is easy to use for the basic functions. Per key lighting, profiles, OLED display.Overall a nice KB but the too common issue of poor quality control is frustrating. I have to return my KB and there are none in stock from authorized sellers so I am not able to get a replacement. Very frustrating.",
          "I absolutely do not regret buying this. Sounds and feels amazing.",
          "I really like this keyboard. This is my very first Steelseries keyboard and I think this will be what I buy from now on. I don't what you can really say about a keyboard but I really like it. lol",
          "\u00a0I bought this sometime ago and you might think I smashed and abused the keyboard in order to damage the LEDs. Nothing of the sort, as you will see that keys like F12 and M3/page up and windows key have these problem as well. It first began with the F12 key, and progressively other LEDs began to fail. All of these began to happen after 6 months of use, and since more keys began to fail, you should think twice and look elsewhere before spending so much for a keyboard. I am stuck with this without being able to reclaim the warranty since it happened because I Live outside the US and I bought it there during a trip, and I just couldn\u2019t go through all the extra hassle to get a replacement.A nice keyboard, with a good feel when typing, but extremely cheap LEDs.",
          "This keyboard it\u2019s great. Thank you",
          "I got the brown switches on the keyboard which I kind of instantly regretted, wishing I had gotten something a little more positively clicky. The blue switches maybe? idk. I've never used a KB with these switches before so I was really just guessing. Also when I start typing fast it feels like some of the keys have some frictional resistance to them, like they're hitting the side of the housing or something. Maybe I'm putting some lateral force on them or something idk. The keys and body feel like they're made out of premium materials, though, and the action feels really nice even though it's a bit off from what I prefer. I don't like how fat and chunky boi the body is, preferring Logitech's super slim design. I also didn't like the honkin' 4AWG cable coming out the back for the dual USB and was wishing it was wireless. However, after using it for a few hours and getting somewhat used to it, I'm pretty happy with it, functionally. Aesthetically, as well. Except for that cable, lol. I'm going to re-arrange my office a bit though so I can get my Cintiq hooked up to my work PC, maybe I'll be able to hide the cable when I do. Overall, I like it enough to keep it for a few years, and at some point I'll probably get a new set of switches for it. 3/5",
          "Pros:Good build quality.Solid wrist rest magnet, you can actually move the keyboard without it coming off.Neutral:Keys, ok but my preference would have been for slightly firmer keys. If you put the tip of your finger on any key there is a slight motion, not a huge deal or a deal breaker but I am replacing a keyboard with rock solid keys.Cons:Cable: hard stiff plastic rather than braided, since it has a \"pass through\" that's to be expected, do not expect it to sit neatly on your desk and do expect problems if you have to pass it behind your desk to a case sitting on the floor.Cable #2: Steelseries touts the keyboard as having a \"pass through\", yeah, no, it's just a fancy term for \"extension\". Yes, the keyboard has a USB port but I could have just as easily bought an $8 USB 3.0 cable if I'd wanted an extension that badly and had a keyboard with a more traditional cable. I will NEVER use the keyboard's USB port.Wrist rest: ergonomic enough but covered in this rubberized material that is slightly sticky, your wrist will not effortlessly slide on it. I don't sit on my desk eating Cheetos all day but everything floating in the air with stick to it. I'm having to wipe it down twice a day with a wet rag. I would have been fin with just a good quality plastic wrist rest.Software: was NOT looking forward to having yet another driver on my computer. In 40 years in IT I NEVER had software for a keyboard but without it you'll be out of luck setting per key colors.OLED: The biggest gimmick, It's hard to see, you have to lean forward to make use it. I can often see it moving out of my peripheral vision so it's something fiddling on your keyboard out of the corner of your eye. It is also mostly useless, since if you want to customize your keyboard to your taste you will have to use the software.Caps Lock, scroll lock, and key lock: There are NO lights on the keyboard indicating that the keys are pressed, rather they keys change color when depressed. Individual LEDs for those keys would have been far more useful than the OLED.Weirdness: Turn your computer off and the lights on the keyboard will turn off, unless you touch a key, then the xmas tree comes on again.There is a general tendency to over complicate everything, that's why we have $500 car keys (fobs). This keyboard replaces my 7 year old AZIO MGK1, that keyboard had custom colors, and per key colors WITHOUT software, no \"pass through\", a braided cable, standard LEDs for the lock keys. In short a pretty standard keyboard whose colors could be customized.Perhaps Steelseries should consider an APEX 7 \"Basics\", I believe that there is a market out there for people that don't want to do all the fiddling that this model requires. I am not saying the keyboard is terrible it's just that they went overboard with the bells and whistles.I paid $119 when I purchased it on November 2022, it was ok since I'd paid $100 for my old keyboard. Now it's $159, I would not have paid that much for it and would have gone for something else.",
          "\u00a0To premise this review, I am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and not a gamer. I looked for a long time before I bought this keyboard because I was looking for the specific qualities of a 107-key layout, volume rocker, usb pass through, and the ability to swap out for third-party keycaps, in particular the ones I had laying around. If you're looking for all those things, this is a really great buy. Plus the LED screen and the 'apps' included with the Steam Engine 3 software are really fun. I have one that shows me the song playing on spotify on my LED, and I think it's great.Regarding a full keycap replacement, this one was perfect for me. If you look at other brands, be careful of their bottom row, I saw a lot with small Fn or Windows keys and I wanted to replace ALL the keys with a full set.I am very satisfied with this keyboard in terms of its functionality, colors, and overall build. However, a small nitpicky issue I have is that version of browns is quite loud. Coming from gateron browns (which I lubed), this had more of a 'ping' sound that irked me. Therefore, I decided to treat this mechanical keyboard the way I do with my smaller ones --- take it apart and insert some felt below the pcb. I also lubed the key switches and stabilizers. Unfortunately this didn't change the sound at all. I didn't want to use o-rings because I don't like how they feel.I originally had the hyperx pudding keycaps on this board because I wanted to take advantage of the RGB, but the sound seemed to echo in it, perhaps because it was thinner around the edges. Still wanting see the RGB in all its glory, I took out another set I had laying around --- some Thick Outlined ABS keycaps that I had bought from Massdrop. I never felt like this set fit in with my other keyboards, but I am happy to report it found its home. This set did the trick and change the sound to something heftier and slightly quieter. Gone was the springy sound before these mods.Of course I would not suggest that you make these changes unless you are comfortable (you may void your warranty). However, I'm very pleased with this keyboard now. If I could replace the plastic bottom of the case, I think I could have something even more special. I've included a sound test of me typing a 1-minute test. I average about 90 words per minute most of the time and this keyboard does not slow me down (nor make me faster).",
          "\u00a0Great keyboard all in all. I use it largely for graphic design and CAD, so the individually programmable keys are great for highlighting hotkeys/etc. The SS software is decent, and didn't take too long to figure out. Gaming-wise.. it's ridiculously cool to have my keys rainbow glow while playing pinball. For FPSs, highlighted keys help me remember those game features I'd probably forget otherwise. The LCD is cute by itself with easy to get animations, and can be setup to monitor your CPU & GPU temperatures. There's also a USB pass-through, though it's not the easiest to use as it's a bit too crisp and tight to easily swap peripherals.",
          "Had this now for about 4 months and it's working fantastic. Only one minor gripe is I thought there would be more use for the screen but the keys block the view of it unless you are looking almost straight down at it. In a future model if they keep the screen, raising it about an inch with a slight 10 or 15 deg angle towards the user would be helpful in making the screen more useful for gaming.",
          "The keyboard is overall pretty solid and the customization and RGB software is actually decent compared to many other brands. However on my keyboard the LEDs started displaying the incorrect colors (random keys are starting to display deep yellow instead of white) after almost exactly 3 years of very regular use. Very disappointed because even one bad LED basically makes the RGB kind of pointless. Will be looking for a new keyboard from a different brand.Also to note: this is my second failed product from SteelSeries. I bought an Aerox 5 Wireless mouse from them that had multiple LEDs failing after a year of use.",
          "1st keyboard that arrived had a line of dead pixels in the OLED screen, but everything else worked fine. Being able to set up custom macros on the fly made my work easier, but I did eventually request an exchange to deal with the damaged OLED screen. The 2nd one had a perfect screen but has issues saving macros. Unline the first one, the only way to save the macros is if you uninstall the SteelSeries Engine 3 software, then set up the macros and save. The worst part is, anytime you want to make any changes, you will have to uninstall and reinstall the software because it will only save the 1st setting after every install.Although it's not perfect, I do worry that the 3rd one will have a different defect, so I'll just deal with the macro issue and keep the current keyboard. Luckily I'm able to save my configurations via cloud storage, so it's not too much of a hassle.Aside from the issues mentioned above, the fact that this keyboard allows you to save 5 different profiles is amazing (a few profiles for party tricks or piano mode). U.I. for the software to change the colors/ reactive features is amazing and the fact that you can remap any key makes my work fly by.UPDATE: Macro issue seems to have resolved on it's own. Not sure if there was an OTA update or not, but I am able to set macros on the fly without any issues",
          "Lots of great features on this keyboard, but I'm disappointed bigtime with the amount of key wobble. Literally makes it difficult to type. Not sure if its the particular unit I got, or the product in general, but I've never seen this much side-to-side movement in a mechanical keyboard. Considering returning...",
          "I have used this keyboard for a little less than a month, and I love everything about it, the brown switch keyboard is still kinda clicky but honestly it\u2019s the right amount of clicky for me. The keys feel great under my fingers. Although I have had to readjust to the keyboard layout a bit. I love the RGB option, and the little OLED display is actually kinda neat, though Steelseries no longer supports showing the song and the artist, there is a GitHub page you can visit that can do it. I dont think Im missing anything else, but do let me know!",
          "The first SteelSeries keyboard had a bad J key that would only work if I smashed it repeatedly.The second keyboard had two keys with dead LED's.This, the third keyboard, worked fine for 6 months then would start flashing different colors soon after boot, and generally refused to show the color layout I setup for my games.The SteelSeries GG software is practically useless.  I fails to recognize any of the games I've setup so I have to manually switch configurations.SteelSeries has no support phone number and no chat.  Only a webform to send them email.  And good luck with that; I've never received a reply.  Just check the Google reviews for SteelSeries and you'll quickly learn that support from SteelSeries is non-existent.Meanwhile, my 4 year-old Corsair K95 still works flawlessly on my old PC.  Today I moved it to my new PC, where it works with no trouble.Why didn't I just buy another Corsair keyboard in the first place?  Well, I thought I could save some money and I liked the idea of having the OLED on the keyboard to display my system load and temps.  Which is pretty much a useless feature: You have almost zero control over the display format, it requires a separate application from SteelSeries which requires approval to run with Admin privileges each time it runs.I've bought a lot of computer products from a lot of manufacturers over the past 40 years.  I can honestly say that this is one of the most disappointing brands I've ever encountered.",
          "I gotta start out by saying I love this keyboard. I love the brown switches, the OLED is nice, and it even get's a little more cool once you have your system temps and info running on it. The lighting is bright and vibrant, and configuring it all within the GG software is a breeze. That being said, I did get this used from Amazon Warehouse under a \"Very Good\" condition, and all that was listed was that the box will be damaged. The box was damaged for sure, thankfully no huge dents and dings but it was in bad shape. I got the keyboard all opened, inspected everything and couldn't find any dirt, scuffs, or anything like that on the keyboard. It was all super clean and for that I am thankful. It wasn't until a couple hours of use that I noticed that 6 keys were in the complete wrong spot and a couple of them were even upside down. But alright, I can fix that. Pretty bummed that whoever checked this didn't notice though. But then after connecting it to the GG software, the previous owner had some type of of weird custom picture loaded onto the OLED screen and while this screen isn't super HD by any means, I could easily tell that the picture was not appropriate and most definitely of the \"Phallic\" nature. I'm an adult, so I'm not offended, but absolutely disappointed in Amazon for this. That's why we are left with a 3 star. I can't knock the keyboard as its absolutely fantastic. The only actual con with the keyboard itself is that the wrist rest is kind of short. I have big hands and if it was an inch or two longer, it would be perfect. Anyways thanks for reading. Hopefully Amazon does better in the future and nobodies children get a weird custom picture on their Apex 7.",
          "What can I say about this keyboard? I bought it to replace my aging Logitech G-15S and was hoping for a useful screen and comfortable keys. So far, the keyboard has been great for gaming and work, but some \"features\" are just not developed as they should be.+ Keys are responsive and have a great tactile sensation+ RGB is impressive with huge amounts of customization+ All the keys are customizable with macros and when you press a key, you can have them light-up differently+ USB pass-through is fast and lights up too!- Keys are friggin LOUD! I was not expecting this as I chose the quieter \"green\" switches. You definitely can hear them on Zoom calls and if someone is trying to watch shows near you.- No media keys. You do get Pause/Play and mute, but previous/next will need special macros. Honestly, they should replace the macro keys, who needs to switch profiles constantly anyway?- The screen is gimmicky. I just leave it on a random animation. Unlike the Logitech, I can't see my media player info, or game information. It's just underwhelming and not super-useful.Overall it's a solid keyboard and I'll keep it. Wish the keys were a bit quieter and the screen was more useful though.",
          "\u00a0This keyboard is not quiet at all but I still like it. It\u2019ll take me some getting used to but the colors are great. I love the aesthetic and I love the fact that you don\u2019t need to download software to customize the colors. I\u2019m using a company computer so they don\u2019t let me download applications. So that was super important for me. So far so good with this keyboard!!",
          "This was the last piece to the Steel Series setup (keyboard, mouse, RGB mouse pad).  The only disappointment was the mouse pad.  I got the Brown switches for tactile but silent.  Coming from Razer Blue Cherry keys took some time as i miss hearing the loud clicking noise, but this is better for streaming and Teams meetings.  For everyday and gaming use I highly recommend.  For comparison, my wife has a Black Widow v3 with the same type of keys (Razer Orange i think) and the key press is slightly heavier on the Razer.  After time you get used to the presses regardless, but that is something to consider.",
          "I bought this keyboard about a year ago intending to keep it for at least 5 years but now I'm planning on selling it. The Apex 7 replaced my old Logitech G-510 keyboard which I used for 5+ years and really liked.What I like about the Apex 7:- The LEDs are bright- It looks and feels like it is built well- The magnetic wrist rest is nice- USB pass-through is nice to have even if I didn't use itWhat I don't like about the Apex 7- The OLED screen is fairly useless since it is not visible from a normal sitting position, it is obscured by the keys of the keyboard.- This is personal preference but I ended up not liking the long keystrokes of the Cherry MX Red Switches and I don't think keyboards with long keystrokes are good for work or gaming.- Steel Series only recently added system monitoring on the OLED screen, it took them well over a year to add this basic functionality and it doesn't even work properly with AMD Ryzen CPUs.- The wrist rest is rubbing the finish off the main body of the keyboard.- The finish on the main body of the keyboard is a magnet for dirt and is hard to clean.- The Keyboard firmware is buggy and sometimes the LEDs get stuck displaying a certain color as well as the color you tell it to display. Believe it or not this is not a hardware issue as the problem did go away eventually but while it was happening multiple factory resets did not fix this problem. I still don't know what made this problem go away but it did.- The media controls suck. I settled for not having dedicated play/pause, stop, back, and forward and I regret that choice.- There is no \"gamemode\" button like what logitech keyboards have. It's not only useful for games but for work too, I ended up hitting the windows key on accident far to often while working.- It is too expensive for what it is- It only has a 1 year warranty despite the high price tag.- Steel Series customer service sucks. When I was having the issue with the LEDs that I mentioned earlier I wasn't asking for a RMA I provided detailed information on what my problem was and what I had done to try and fix the problem on my own, I even linked them a video of the problem. They didn't acknowledge my problem and just gave me a copy paste response to start the RMA process. The RMA process is very convoluted and they ask you to destroy your own product. It reminds me of those internet scams that trick people into putting their i-phones in microwaves to charge them. It's a pretty ridiculous policy to have IMO. I felt like they where treating me like the problem and that I was trying to somehow scam another keyboard out of them when all I did is ask some questions on troubleshooting.Closing Thoughts:I am selling my apex 7 and have already replaced it with a Logitech G-910 Spectrum which I typed this review with and probably should have bought in the first place. I have had to RMA Logitech products before but at least their RMA process has always been great and they have certainly earned more trust from me then steel series has, especially with how long my Logitech G-510 keyboard lasted. If I where you I'd stay away from the Apex7 and consider other cheaper options from brands that actually value their customers or at least make an effort to make sure that their customers get what they pay for.",
          "Wow, I did a lot of research on mechanical gaming keyboards and I kept coming back to this one. This is my first mechanical keyboard since I've always used laptops, so I'm not used to the loudness of the keys. But man this thing is a beauty! I absolutely love the OLED function, I added the marvel flipping animation and it's so cool to look at it. Worth the money in my opinion. I've been really impressed with Steel Series lately, this is a great match for my Sensei 310 mouse since I'm one handed (left hand only). The LED back-lit key features are so fun to look at. I have it to were whenever I hit Enter, there's a wave of LED lights that shoot out in both directions. Great keyboard and I'm extremely happy with my decision. Obviously you buy what's right for you and works better for you, but if I was building my PC all over again with my new experience, I'd buy this keyboard still. That's just my opinion.",
          "This keyboard is great, and I love almost everything about it. It's so customizable, great to type on, and overall just a solid board.The one issue I have is that there's a few lights on it which can't be turned off, meaning short of unplugging it/turning off the computer, these lights will always be on. One of these is on the USB port at the back, which makes it hard to apply a black-out sticker onto as well. Since I like to sleep in a pitch-black room, this is most unfortunate. Hopefully future revisions of this keyboard will allow you to turn off all of its lights.",
          "The product does what it is advertised to do and does it well. My only issue with the keyboard itself is that the build quality of the frame is not what i anticipated, but it is a great keyboard if you can get it on sale.",
          "I love the matte black keycaps and the feel and tactile feedback of the blue switches. The keyboard looks the part, and is great for typing. My only complaint is it gathers dust quickly, especially the OLED screen. Speaking of the OLED screen, it is great, lots of customization and ease of use. The software is intuitive and straight to the point, and the keyboard itself is just so customizable and fantastic -- I love it! You can sync it with Discord to change a section of the keyboard's RGB when you get notified, and speaking of the RGB it is great, bright, and accurate. The wrist rest is nice and comfortable -- not better than Razer, but still comfortable. The wrist rest also unfortunately gathers dust quickly. It also comes with a USB port on the left side, however you need another USB slot on your device for it to work. Besides dust gathering, this is a near perfect keyboard, I really am in love with it, it's great! Totally recommend.",
          "8 months after purchase, the \"S\" key and colon/semicolon key switches on my keyboard began to fail, and I don't use my keyboard nearly intensely enough for that to be reasonable. Unfortunately, this fell after the product support period expired for me so I guess I have to look into replacing the switches myself, but this is pretty annoying.",
          "**UPDATE: After using this keyboard for EXACTLY 1 year (coincidence?), the Home key suddenly has a malfunctioning LED and will not display any blue/purple/pink hues.  Awaiting a reply from SteelSeries, but I imagine I'm stuck with the defective switch and will likely purchase a different brand as a replacement.  Two stars have been deducted from my original review.What I love about the SteelSeries Apex 7 keyboard:1. Vibrant LED lights with superb visibility2. Ability to customize different light profiles that launch automatically with various PC programs/games3. OLED display that can be customized with logos or animated GIFs4. Magnetic wrist rest that detaches easily and is extremely simple to clean (no textured grooves to collect dirt!)5. SteelSeries software requires minimal CPU background usage compared to HyperX software on previous keyboard6. Red switches are clicky yet aren't obtrusive.  I know when I've pressed a key, but the whole house isn't alerted that mom is gaming yet again.7. Very comfortable for my middle-aged fingers and wrists8. Looks nice with my SteelSeries dual surface prism mousepad9. SteelSeries Engine software is way more reliable than Razer Synapse10. Caps Lock key glows white when activated, which is a nice feature.What could be improved:My main gripe is that there are absolutely zero instructions included about the OLED display and the menu/functions within it.  I initially had trouble loading the profiles I created in the SteelSeries Engine software to the keyboard, but I eventually fumbled through the OLED display menu on the keyboard and figured out how to load/activate each profile.  The process is a bit cumbersome.  SteelSeries support keeps promising me a comprehensive guide to the OLED display but has yet to deliver.Other than that, I really have no complaints and am very pleased with the Apex 7 vs. my old HyperX Alloy Elite.  I didn't opt for the Apex Pro keyboard because, as a middle-aged mom who only games casually, I felt no use for fully customizable switches.  I'm a huge fan of the game Super Animal Royale, and I have won many matches with my new Apex 7!  If SteelSeries would only make gaming earbuds (I get headaches from headsets) and a mouse with a tilting scroll wheel, I could completely ditch Razer and game 100% with SteelSeries gear.  Just buy the Apex 7 keyboard already, it's pretty spiffy!  :)",
          "I just picked up this apex 7 along with a rival 310 as part of my desktop refresh. I've gone through a ton of cheap keyboards, and wanted to go through the mechanical keybaord experience. The first thing I noticed was the heftiness of the metal build. The keys also felt solid under my fingers when I typed. I got the red switch, which is supposed to be the quietest version, but the keys are still noticeably loud compared to its non-mechanical counterparts.For the additional features: the magnetic wrist support seems okay, although I might end up not using it if it eats up too much desk real estate. The LED display and multimedia volume wheel on the top left are other examples of things that are cool, but probably not what I'm going to utilize very frequently.Overall, it's a solid keyboard with a long long lifetime even when under constant duress from gaming. It was a bit pricey at $140, but worth it for such a workhorse product.",
          "Okay, I knew that before I bought it, but I thought it would feel like Cherry MX Blues, since they were calling them blue clicky keys.  For background I'm coming from a HyperX (a Razor before that).  These feel more like the a Razor than the HyperX with real Cherry MX Blue keys.  They do click, but feel odd... The click isn't as pronounced and there's not the upward bump that I feel in the MX blues.  I think that's it anyway.  Also, the key caps are almost slippery... not what I was expecting at all.  I know I could change the key caps, but that's ridiculous at this price range.  I'm going to give it a chance...  Just because something is different doesn't make it bad necessarily.Couple of notes:  Yes, you can adjust the brightness (or even off) on the keyboard.  The software seems to be fine, and it retains settings if shut the app down.  I don't like have extra stuff running.UPDATE:  Very disappointed that one of the LEDs went out already.  it's not a bad keyboard, but I expect it to last longer than this.UPDATE:  Lost another LED.  I like the keyboard, but can't recommend with the LEDs failing.  Time to look for a replacement... already.",

          "After having two failures of keyboards due to quality control issues from a competitor starting with \u201cR\u201d I am pleased to say I don\u2019t have any issues with this keyboard from SteelSeries.  All keys are clicky as ever, great responses from key presses, lights are bright and lighting works very well.  Been using the keyboard for a little while now and it is a solid keyboard with good build quality.  Keys have just a little wiggle to them but not much.  Nothing seems to be cheap on this one, which yes, includes the price, but at least you\u2019re getting what you pay for on this one.",
          "It's a little loud, but feels really good to type on. Wrist support feels good, and plenty of customization options on their driver",
          "I've had the Apex 7 keyboard for 1 year and 2 weeks and it has been great. My use is not for gaming and it is used in an office environment. Today there are two keys which no longer backlight as blue. They appear as green. One of the colors which compose blue must have burned out. The only color that makes all the keys the same color is red. I checked the SteelSeries warranty and it only covers the keyboard for one year. With my luck here it is two weeks later and the keyboard LED's are burning out. Otherwise it is a great keyboard and so much better than the $5 keyboard you get from HP."

          "Headphones work fine, microphone is a little finicky to get situated to pick up voice without sound of breathing, but that might just be a personal issue as adjust a microphone leaves me winded.Biggest problem (apparently pretty common with Arctis headphones) is that this headset includes a volume control knob designed to allow you to change the relative volume of 'chat' and 'game' channels.  This is a neat feature in theory but suffers from a couple of issues:A) The knob to adjust the volume is extremely easily turned, which means that if you don't put it somewhere nothing will touch it, you're likely to have one of the channels muted or rapidly changing volume before longandB) There's no version of the adapter to allow you to use the headphones with the microphone unless you have the knob attached, or a switch to lock/disable the knob.  The output from the headphones is a special port that connects to the knob which outputs as a normal USB.  You can also use a normal 3.5mm jack, but as the manufacturer notes, to do so is to lose out on the surround sound capability and other features.All-in-all they're fine headphones, but if you're on the fence you should be aware that you will end up with an extra permanent feature on your desk that you have to keep isolated from any contact, which makes it a little hard to recommend them.",

          "This gaming headset is everything for me! I use it exclusively for PC gaming and love the dial that lets me change sound focus from browser/game to voice chat. It's really helpful during gaming moments where I don't have time to manually go into the game settings and lower the sound so I can hear instructions or callouts for fights in Final Fantasy XIV.I also have a Elgato Wave 3 mic and I can still use the game/chat dial with the Elgato Wave Deck program, it just takes a little fiddling with. Ease of use is so great though!The sound quality is not too bad, the only place I've noticed any dip in quality is with music. It still sounds good, but not quite as good as a Razer headset. The functionality of this headset supercedes that one teeny flaw for me.Noise cancellation is pretty good too! There are dogs that live in the home that constantly bark when their owners are away, for hours at a time, and these headphones are the one thing saving my sanity from the incessantly borking doggos.They wear so easily and are comfortable on my head. The velcro band at the top can be adjusted to fit probably any size head.If you're even considering getting this headset, just do it. Please, just do it. Thank me later!",

It's very comfortable and lightweight and I love the ear pad cushioning. It's plug and play, so the software isn't necessary, however, you'll need it if you want to tweak around with the RBG lighting and other configurations. The mic quality is clear and I like that it's retractable for the times I don't need to use it. The only thing that I've noticed and agree with the other reviews is that the sound is not as loud as I would have expected, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, it's a great gaming headset and worth the purchase.",
          "I don't have any particular qualms with the quality of the noise. I use these for things like gaming, listening to videos, or getting on video calls and Discord (many people complimented how good my microphone sounded). However, about a year in, the little wheel on the headset to adjust the volume began to act a little weird; sometimes I would only be able to hear through one ear, and would have to fiddle with it to fix it. Almost two years in, one of the ear muffs completely fell off (the material holding it to the base began ripping), and the other one is already well on its way. Were they good? Yes. I would have just preferred the earmuffs not falling off.",

After a few youtube videos looking for optimal settings and adjustments and software downloads I was able to hear footsteps from opponents in Valorant even when teammates were clueless. A real game changer and very comfortable. For this price I consider it a steal. Only complaint I have is the fragile feeling and looking wire which I was able to manage correctly, however I wish it had a little more premium feel to it. The added knob for control is a great plus and looks good mounted onto my desk.",
          "The build of the attics 5 look nice but compared to other headphones for the same price it has too much plastic components and makes it feel like a $60 headset. Software is good and very customizable. The ear cushions good for comfort and sound but other noises will leak through the cushions which makes it bad for people who like feel of immersion in a game/movie/music. The audio Jack adaptor is bad, it\u2019ll make a static noise when moving around or accidentally bumping it, wouldn\u2019t recommend using it unless you have too. The sound quality without dts is okay. The sound quality with DTS on is good but not great, depending on what you play. Some sounds will be distorted such as explosions, humming, and buzzes, making the quality of the headset feel cheap. I would only recommend this headset if it were on sale for $60.",

He finds this super irritating and is using his old falling-apart headphones instead of these new ones I bought him for Christmas.  Disappointed.  On the positive side he says they are comfortable.",
          "After researching wired headsets for a while I finally decided to give the Arctis 5 a try.Lets start with the bad first:Volume wheel feels cheap and loose (but does work well)Hard to hear yourself even when you've maxed out the Mic SidetoneWires are super long which may be a downside for some. (My cat likes them a little too much)Now the good:Super, SUPER comfortable! Can't imagine a more comfortable pair of headphones. The strap is genius. Perfectly spreads the weight of the headphones over your head without any pressure spots and it's easily adjustable. The ear cups are made of cloth and memory foam which is great if you're like me and you hate leather or faux leather against your head (don't know if they can be washed but I'll have to find out). Besides the general comfort of it they also don't make you overly sweaty during long gaming sessions and because they're cloth it doesn't make a perfect seal against your head which can cause headaches from the pressure against your eardrums. The MIC is retractable which is a convenient feature and it's simple to adjust it to the perfect position. Everyone I've gamed with has stated the voice quality is good to great. Aesthetically they're simple and tasteful looking with a little bit of bling and eye candy with the configurable LED light rimming each ear cup. Sound quality appears to be pretty good for a roughly one hundo pair of headphones.Besides a few minor quibbles the Arctis 5 wired headset is overall a VERY comfortable, decent sounding, nice looking pair of headphones for the money.",
          "I had a pair of these for a few years and loved them. Over time there started to be minor popping or crackling by the end of their life and the microphone as described by friends \"sounded like I was in a whirlwind.\"These new ones fit perfectly and snug. Sound is just as amazing as my previous pair. I can't recommend these enough!",
          "A solid and well designed headset, the Arctis 5 does everything I want, the only downside as other reviews have noted is the proprietary connectors. This is well constructed and comfortable, even for someone with a larger head like me. The head elastic helps a lot, as do the ear cups. I was dubious about the retractable microphone, but since this is a headset I bring back and forth to work, it is actually a really nice feature.The volume adjust on the headset with the chat/game balance knob takes some getting used to, but is definitely not a bad feature. This headset is intended for people doing gaming rather than my primary purpose which is work, but it works very well in my role as a remote IT helpdesk manager/dispatcher. I will try to remember to update on longevity since the reason I got it is due to other headsets breaking in a couple months.",

          "I've had this headset for about 8 months. It sounds okay. I'm not an audiophile. I've noticed the latency seems to feel a little worse than the 3.5 hyperx I had before, but also seems to improve a little with some windows tweaks by explicitly disabling enhancements (could be placebo), but I'm not that surprised since it's connected via usb and shows up as two audio devices to the OS.I have their audio software installed. I generally forget it exists.Something that did annoy me just now, however, and inspired me to write this, is that my audio completely died in the middle of playing a certain shall-not-be-named moba. It died, came back, and died again, lagged my computer, and finally pulled me out of fullscreen to show me a stupid \"steelseries gg\" window. Really cool of you to decide you waited too long for me to click update and to just force it on me while I'm actively using the computer.Interrupting what I'm doing to force an update on me is something Windows already does plenty and I don't need your junkware to do it to me too, considering the software doesn't really do anything meaningful for me anyway.Mind, that doesn't happen often and it only actually happened this particular time. And granted, I'd been ignoring the constant notifications of it begging me to update it. Despite that, I find it ridiculous enough that they would force an update on you while you're doing something in a way that interrupts what you're doing for a good 30 seconds.",
          "I got this headset hoping to upgrade from my ASTRO A10 headset.Generally, there are more benefits than there are drawbacks.While the headset audio quality is nowhere near that of ASTRO gaming, the Arctis 5 headset audio quality gets the job doneThe microphone quality on the Astro A10 headset is mediocre, but the Arctis 5 build-in microphone quality and muting functionality are superb.While the ASTRO A10 headset is bulky, durable, and very heavy, the SteelSeries Arctis 5 headset is comfortable, light, and disadvises any heavy-duty handling.The product promises 7.1 Digital Surround Sound through its surround sound simulator software \"SteelSeries Engine 3\".The software offers terrible \"surround sound\" as it just hampers the audio, so I just leave it off.However, the software is more useful than most people review!It offers a wonderful equalizer, microphone volume tuner, RGB-lighting earcup customizer, and microphone sidetone (which lets you hear yourself as you talk in the mic; it isn't ideal but it's there if you want to use it)(I recommend the following equalizer settings:)(62.5 = 4.1) (250 = 1.9) (1K = 0) (3.6K = 1.7) (12K = 1)If there are two things that the Astro 10 headset does considerably better than the Arctis 5 Headset, it would be providing surround sound capabilities and in-line volume control.I play a lot of shooters, and it is much easier to determine where sounds are coming from in the 3D digital space with the Astro A10 headset than the Arctis 5 headset.The in-line volume control on the Astro A10 headset is more rigid and secure, while the volume control on the Arctis 5 left earcup is so sensitive that even picking up the headset would be enough force to turn the volume control wheel.The delicacy of the game-chat audio mixer is ludicrous; just about any amount of force could turn the mixer wheel!Finally, the way that the earcups on the Arctis 5 can turn inwards but can never outwards is a little disappointing as this headset has some serious personal speaker potential with its volume capabilities.Now for my most favorite part of using the Arctis 5 headset! The Arctis 5 headset is great for listening to music!This headset comes with two ports: the custom mini-USB and the 3.5mm audio jack ports.I love that I can be able to 3.5mm Bluetooth Adapter, and it becomes a wireless headset!It doesn't have the best audio quality, but this is a major upgrade from the Astro A10's incompatibility with anything less than 5-pole 3.5mm audio jacks in the earcups.Granted that you also have a headset case, you can take the Arctis 5 headset and a 3.5mm Bluetooth adapter on the go!You can wear these for much longer periods of time than any Astro headset, which is always a plus!",
          "I was a bit skeptical at first when I first purchased these because of the differing reviews. Some totally hated this headset, and some praised them for being the best in the market. I decided to take the chance and buy them. When I received them I was scared of them being a bad headset. After taking them out of the box and plugging them into the USB port on my Playstation (which is what I use them on), I could tell that the sound was pretty decent for $100. I noticed that it sounded a little tinny but it seems to be going away after a week or two. It isn't that loud of a headset so if you prefer headphones that make your ears bleed than these aren't for you, but I don't need super loud headphones. The surround sound is pretty good and noticeable too. The mic is pretty good, I wouldn't say it is as good as advertised, it definitely isn't \"The Best Mic in Gaming\". The mic is good though and should be perfectly fine for gaming with friends. Now let's talk about the negatives. The biggest problem I have with the headset is that the cords are a mess and unnecessarily long. I also think they should get rid of the ChatMix dial because I don't see a purpose in really having it, also it is very sensitive so a little nudge will adjust the dial and possibly turn your game sound off. Another thing I don't like is that the ear cups are really shallow and the speaker is usually touching your ear which can sometimes get a little uncomfortable (although the head strap is really nice). The last thing is not the headphones themselves but the way they are advertised. These are advertised as the most high-quality headset on the market, but it is really just another average headset, they really hype it up for more than it is.Pros- The sound is pretty good for the price- The mic sounds really good- Pretty good surround sound- The RGB lights look AMAZING- Pretty convenient buttons- Head strap is pretty comfortableCons- Cords are a nightmare- ChatMix Dial is kind of annoying- Not very loud (really not a big deal)- Ear cups really shallow",
          "I've been using steel series for years now and it's never let me down",
          "Everything is great!",
          "Pros:-Excellent sound for gaming and music (for the casual music listener, that is)- Wonderful EQ and features built into app- So dang comfortable, could wear them for long sessions without them becoming a factor- Cups are soft and durable. Material doesn't peel.- Party/Game audio knob is convenient.- FPS gamers will enjoy the  accurate audio cues.- Clean appearance, fun RGB customization options.Cons:- For best audio, you can't wear most gaming glasses or a ballcap. Explained below;If you wear anything that might lift the top of the ear cup from your head, you will compromise the low end of your audio. The cup MUST rest against your head around your ear, else your sound will be tinny.- Can't find a very convenient location for the adjustment knob, it sort of just floats around my desk. (Hardly inconvenient, more of just a silly observation)- Not ideal for console gaming, as you lose the all-important audio software, and must manipulate game/party volume through the console.Another plus to mention, the mute light on the mic is super clutch (though it does not work when using headset with console)..",
          "This purchase was a birthday gift to a good friend, this head set is so good that I had to by myself a new one because my wife stole the ones I was using at the time!Noise canceling.

          "After vacuuming up the cord of my very old Razer Cacharias (?) headset, it finally declared its death when my Discord group mentioned I was cutting in and out, and so it was time to replace my headset.  For a very terrible 3 months, I bought a discount headset with plasticized ear cups, and while I could hear and communicate, it was very uncomfortable.  I was looking into other Razer alternatives but didn't really feel as if their features were as interesting as the Steelseries, and I also had a few recommendations for Steelseries from others.  Attach to it RGB function (my tower is needlessly fluorescent) and I decided to plop down the funds for this wired version.  I've never been a fan of wireless, just something about connection and not having to worry if the wireless is up in a clutch moment is just my style.The headset is very stylish.  I'm a small person, with an average size head and average but slightly pokey-outey ears.  The fabric and the stretch fabric on the headset is very comfortable and breathable.  It angles just a touch forward when I wear it, which is not noticeable after a few minutes.  The retractable microphone works very well, and my raid leader says I'm very crisp - definitely not the case with my knockoff cheapo headset.Length of the plug leading from the headset to the dial toggle is very generous, as well as from the dial toggle to the computer.  Due to USB hogging I have to use the top of my tower USBs, but no problem at all, very forgiving in length.  I haven't had it fall out yet but I'm not headbanging while raid healing.  The dial toggle is very cool!  I can use it to easily mute out game noise if there's an issue, or vice versa if everyone is just talking about nothing and I want to tone them down.  At neutral, it's equal for both.RGB functionality is initially a bit complicated looking but is through Steelseries' app that you can download, and you can make separate profiles.  I have a violet/blue shifting thing for my Tauren Shadowpriesting and have several other profiles - glowing gold for my paladin, green for druid, etc.  And there are sound function toggles.Sound is great, crisp, and no reverb at all.  The surround function at least in World of Warcraft is excellent and positionally is usually great, although for some reason sometimes when I'm mounting up on a specific mount the sound will originate more to the left, but, this isn't always, and maybe is a function of my setup.I especially like this for Youtube progressive house mixes, bass turned up!  The noise cancellation is not really cancellation, but the muffling is enough that it takes out more ambient noise.  I live by a freeway though, so there's nothing killing that noise.  Definitely softer.I really like this headset.  I would recommend if you're in the market, give this a good try, I hope mine has a lot of life left in it.  It's a lightweight headset and the cords are fairly lightweight but give you great range.Also a good wow factor, if anyone is watching you game, and I can make it match my tower RGB, hah hah.  The little things, eh?",
          "Good sound. Good comfort. Good durability. Only issue is the location of the mixer on the cord. For my setup it falls to floor level and the dial can inadvertently catch and the chat is gone without me realizing it while in the midst of playing.",
          "have had this for over 2 years, no issues.  durable like all steelseries products. the multiple nobs for sound control make for easy adjustment.",
          "I literally only bought these because I needed a mic because my antlion melted and I dont have room for a mic stand/arm. No immediate complaints. They sound fine, I rather like the game/chat dial, and the mic quality seems to be adequate/ I've asked people how it sounds compared to the old mic and it seems to be about on par.Original pads not quite for me though, a little too little padding gives me pressure spots.",
          "I am still looking for the perfect fitting headset, as I have a large head and most will apply too much pressure for long 2+ hour gaming sessions. Out of going through 5 headsets all ranging from $50-$200, this has been the most comfortable so far!Sound quality is goodMy ears fit inside well.The ear cups conform to your head a bit. Something I have found to be important especially for me since this allows it to fit better.ConsMy head still seems to be a bit too big, and I have found that while the ear cups conform much better than others, the overall headset stretches a bit too much and causes a bit of pressure making it uncomfortable for extensive use.For gaming though, I have used it for a few days now and just wearing it a couple hours a day seems fine!I will continue to use this headset, and just carry on my search for a better fitting headset that my stupid head will be happy with!Overall  4/5",
          "It's pathetic how negative the comments for these headphones, as well as 90% of other gaming headphones, can be and how inaccurate they are. READ IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS HEADPHONE.The pros and cons BELOW...The sound quality is absolutely amazing, you can FEEL the sound vibrations and high quality it produces. The Steelseries headphones, this one, comes with a software you can install to customize your headphones, both physically and the audio engineering side of it; you can turn the bass up, down, completely customize the EQ.The comfort of these headphones was a big deal to me, they are the only headphones that I can wear for 6+ hours in one sitting and feel like they're not even there. The comfort is ridiculously amazing with these headphones, so on that, I give them 10/10.The catch is...the Steelseries software is a complete joke. Every time you turn on your computer to use these you have to unplug and plug the headphones back in if you want the full 7.1 surround sound feeling. Trust me, you'll feel a HUGE difference on how amazing it is when you feel the full potential of these headphones. But it's frustrating and ridiculous to have to do this EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn on-and-off your computer. If you don't do this, then you'll just get the basic quality the headphones delivers (which is still VERY amazing).",
          "I'm so glad I decided to just shell out the extra money for a good headset. Steelseries engine has preset equalizers. one is Flat, one is Voice, they sound like shit, as expected. but man, when you set the equalizer to Music? shiiiiiiiiiiit. these things sound incredible when you have some spotify blasting. just out of the box they sound good. but downloading the engine and trying different presets is nice.they're also super comfortable. the velcro makes it weird trying to find the right fit but it only takes 2 minutes of fidgeting around to find it. if that. the earpads are crazy soft and squishy, they feel great. I wear glasses too. no problem. they might feel weird at first, you just have to find the right fit with the velcro. they sit on your head and around your ears so seamlessly.the mic is basically what you would expect from a headset. it doesn't sound incredible but it's good for what you pay for. it's better than most i've heard.has a volume scroll wheel on the left ear to raise or lower your volume. very nice.its great,  buy it.",
          "\u00a0I\u2019ve had this headset for around 2 years now and it\u2019s still going strong. Outlasted every other headset that I\u2019ve ever had. This headset has good sound and microphone quality. I would recommend this headset even if you have a console like me, just plug it into the usb port in the back of your console and you\u2019re good to go. However, if you have a console, the game/party audio scroll wheel doesn\u2019t really work for anything other than lowering down the volume of the headset, which is why I don\u2019t use it, I think this is more of a pc feature. But overall this headset is great and looks very aesthetically pleasing as well.",
          "Works great with PS5, good value",
          "I bought this for my brother who is extremely picky about his headsets. I've had to return two sets of headsets because of it. It took me months to find him the right headset. He wanted a headset that had a quality mic or audio with incoming quality sound on the headphones as well. This type of headset is not so easy to find when it's a USB cord. USB cords aren't known for the best audio or sound quality. This is the best headset I've found. He hasn't complained at all about it. He's only had good things to say about the headset. If you're looking for an inexpensive headset, with high-quality features, and a USB cord then this is definitely the best headset you can buy hands down.",
          "Overall, I like this headset! I've been using earbuds for years and  I thought I needed an upgrade. The audio is clear and the surround sound is on point making you feel like you're actually in the environment you're listening to. It fits my head comfortably and doesn't squish my glasses.However, the RGB setting seem to not sync with the software on my end unless I have the prismsync app configuration on (although I am not a huge RGB fan so it doesn't bother me thst much).",
          "This headset is pretty good. The dial is great, and after using a USB headset I don't think I can ever go back to using a jack headset. The RGB lights are fun and the customizability in the Steelseries program is pretty nice. I've only had two notable issues:1) The left earpiece has a tendency to be quieter. Can't tell if this is a me issue with my own ear or a headset issue, but you can manually balance the speaker levels in your native sound systems so it's not that big of an issue.2) The mic is great... For lower voices. I have a higher voice, and since this lacks some of the decibel levels in the high range, it's much more tinny for my voice. If you have a deeper voice this'll probably be better for you. Mic is still good quality, just sounds tinny.Overall, I like it! Good and fun headset, get it on sale if you can.",
          "\u00a0Hey all, so I'm not too experienced in this field of the market. I had a hand-me-down pair of Turtle Beach X12's that lasted for around 12 years (they don't make em like they used to/Discontinued \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14)I really enjoy these so far. They seem more flexible than the pair of headphones I have for my xbox, same manufacturer as above, though a much more over-designed model.  Obviously, flexibility is not critical to the product but to my mind it will go a long way towards extending the longevity of this headset.Sound Quality, I am hardly an expert on. When I listen to music, I can hear a deeper depth (more tones or even \"instruments\") than I would with say... stock speakers. This is a huge plus to me. That factor is what I like about headphones. As far as gaming goes... when I think of gaming headsets I think of \"footsteps,\" as considered in shooter games. The only shooter I seem to have played so far while owning these is Insurgency Sandstorm.I think the directional quality of the sound is as good as can be expected for ~$60 dollars, maybe even better.I know that after several rounds I am slightly keyed up and or shaking from the immersive quality of my gaming experience.  I remember the gun sounds as excellent, whether this is from the game or headphones I'm unable to discern.I would recommend these to a friend.In a very subjective sense I like them better than I might have liked a highly branded pair. \ud83e\udd1fThe attached video is the standard pattern of RGB transition/ what they look like in the dark.",
          "These is, by far, the best headset I have ever gotten. The audio quality is amazing, and they are very comfortable to wear. After purchasing a horribly tinny and uncomfortable Logitech Headset that used the same surround sound tech as this one, I was expecting to be met with the same issues that caused me to return those. To my pleasant surprise, the audio quality on these things are amazing. The ear cups have nice acoustics, allowing for the audio from the speakers to be delivered to your ears with complete clarity while blocking out noise. And while talking about the ear cups, I'd like to mention how pleasant they are to wear. They create a nice barrier from the outside while still being breathable and soft. They don't create an air tight seal which sucks on your ears like leather cups, and they don't feel cheap or itchy like most cloth cups I've had the displeasure of wearing. The head band adapts nicely to the size of my head without needing to fumble with extensions or straps. It rests on your head snuggly, so you can look around without worry, but no so tight that it causes any sort of discomfort.As important as comfort is, the main concern regarding all headsets is audio and audio quality. You won't be disappointed with these! Just out of the box, they deliver amazing audio quality across the spectrum, and by enabling surround sound in Steelseries' software, you get clear and immersive surround sound which delivers concise positional audio. The microphone also delivers great clarity, with the audio quality coming close to most consumer end dedicated mics.I definitely recommend this headset for anyone looking to game or chat. They look nice, sound great, and feel good. I'd go as far as to say that they're a steal at $99.99.",
          "I bought them after my no name antiques quit. I can\u2019t stand tight pinching, hot over the ear headphones. These are the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever owned and they represent fine quality from the second you open the box to the extremely high quality sound. Using them with my Xbox X Series i Watch movies with them on. Very comfortable",
          "Only thing is having audio problems other then that it\u2019s fine.",
          "I've owned this headset for several years now. It's been a pretty consistent experience.Pros: Quality sound and a decent amount of customization with the application.Breakaway cable able to be switched with a normal headphone cableVolume and mic mute adjustment easy to find and useMic quality is pretty good, all things considered.Cons: Breakaway cable connecting the headset to inline USB chat dongle is prone to twisting, which for me resulted in eventually having to replace it due to damage caused by this phenomenon. This is fixed by unplugging it from either end and allowing it to unwind.Maybe not quite as loud as I would like, but this could be preference.Only minor adjustment to the fit with the strap provided.Ultimately, I would recommend this headset if you're a fan of the Steelseries ecosystem. I would maybe opt for a wireless model, but this one isn't bad if that isn't your preference.",
          "If you get them on 69 bucks buy them, they are worth it and big  enough even for the biggest of heads",
          "Bought mid 2020 and they're still holding up amazing (1/23 as of now). 100% would buy again.",
          "I was recommended this brand of headphones. I loved the face that it had RGB lights on each cup. I am a RGB fanatic. I pulled the trigger on the wired ones. I didn't want Bluetooth especially for gaming. I love how long the cord is. That is awesome. Now I def don't like the type of connection that goes from the DAC to the actual headphones. Its a unique type connection. As for sound quality these are amazing. Especially in COD it sounds like you actually there. For music it sounds awesome. Now def download the software. And def turn on 7.1 Surround sound. These sound horrible with out that on. They sound like tin cans. Equalizer is really good. I love that you can boost up dialogue and bass. Great for music. Not so great for video games. As when you boost the bass video games gets drowned with bass. My issue is how flimsy sometimes the connection to the actual headphones are. Theres times where I move my head and the connection seems to go in and out. Audio sounds far away. But just a tight push and it works with no issues. Idk it could just be me but I dont know how these are rated as the best mic in gaming. Im sorry but I have heard ASTRO headphones that are 30 bucks sound better. I def use a Condenser XLR mic. I dont use the mic on this headset at all. For the price I paid I def like these. I would buy them again. And honestly I would recommend these to anyone.",
          "Un sonido mas envolvente y que sean para barias consolas de guego",
          "Hello. When I first opened the Headphone, there was no defect in it.Pros(2): The headset has great sound and microphone. I really like RGB lighting and headphone looks very good.The downside: The headset does not normally make a person sweat, but it does when playing games",
          "Nothing to say, it is the perfect headset under 80$",
          "they are great quality headphones! my boyfriend uses them daily and he can never hear me over his game - so they work great. He also has said some pretty great stuff about it sitting right on his head",
          "Great for gaming & very comfortable.",
          "To this day it works just the chat dial mix part is a bit loose. If only i could replace that it would be just like new. Still my daily headset and will continue.",
          "These are great headphones. The audio is great, and my buddies say my microphone it a lot  better than the earbuds I used to use. Plus the RGB lighting matches my Corsair build, even though you can't really control the headphone color with the Corsair software. I wasn't expecting to, so this is perfectly fine. These headphones have a great minimalistic design that I love.The pads around the ears and headband are very comfortable and breathable, much better than some other models that don't let your ears breathe and allow things to get humid.There is a volume knob wired into the cord about halfway between the headset and USB connector. I wish this came with something to stick the knob to my desk or tower. If I move around, sometimes it will fall and the knob will twist after contacting something, either reducing the volume of game chat or the game itself. I wish the knob had a stronger detent in the middle to prevent unintentional adjustments.Also, when you mute your mic, a red light comes on at the tip of the mic. It is very bright. You can overcome this by retracting the mic into the headset (which is a neat feature) but you can still see the light in your monitor reflection if it is dark in your room. Sort of annoying, but you get used to it.Lastly, for some strange reason, outside noise seems to be louder when wearing these. I have two mini fridges (beer cooler and wine cooler) in the same room as my PC and I can hear them louder with these on than when I take them off. I really can't explain it - maybe the headphone housing unintentionally amplifies these noises?"

          "Before I begin let me explain I have had MANY wired and wireless headsets over the years. I typically have purchased from different manufacturers each time trying to find what I really wanted. I can honestly say I would buy this one again.The Good.- Price! After looking at some different reviews online this was honestly one of the highest-rated and still reasonable cost- Battery Life has been outstanding! It lasted 24 hours straight without issue or even a low battery warning.- I am very happy with the sound quality and I have been told the mic quality is excellent as well. I spend quite a bit of time chatting on discord and people said that I was super clear. In addition, the Steel Series GG software for the headset is fairly straightforward. The controls also make it nice as you can easily adjust levels between game and chat volume using the dial built onto the headset.- Comfort. This is easily the most comfortable headset I have used. It does not feel like it is weighing my head down. The ski goggle type band is very comfortable and does not feel binding or pressure on the head. The ear cups are large enough that they do not press in on any part of my ear. And even with glasses, they are not pressing into me.- On headset controls are simple to use.- Easy to set up, everything was paired out of the box. Just plugged in the receiver and turned on the headset. Good to go.The Bad or more to the point potentially bad.- Retractable microphone arm. While it seems sturdy enough and goes in and out of the earcup rather smoothly I could see this as a definite point of failure down the road depending on how often you extend and retract it.- Charging cable was a little on the short side for me. I would have to measure it to be sure but I believe the included cable was only 3 feet.- The charing port on the headset itself just doesn't feel as solid as I would like. No issues to report so far, but it does seem like a possible point of failure down the road.So all in all I would say this is a great headset, even more so for the price point. If you are looking for something and aren't sure I would definitely give this a try.",
          "I have been in the search for a wireless gaming headset for years.  I have had issues with every one I have tried ranging from too hot, not comfortable on my head (slightly big head), poor sound, wireless delays, ETC.  This one nailed everything dead on.COMFORT (pressure)The strap at the top with the firm but flexible design of the headset allows it to sit comfortable on my head and allowed it to easily form to my head with no downward pressure and a snug but not too tight fit around the ears.  I can wear this for 8 hours at a time with no issues.COMFORT (heat)Most headsets that cover the ears have caused me to eventually feel warm or start sweating after an hour.  This headset can go 8 hours with me barely noticing it, in fact, I have forgotten I am wearing it a few times.SOUND QUALITYExcellent sound quality, and with the software equalizer, you can tweak it to your liking.  I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but I am pleased and think most gamers will find it's sound superior to most other headsets on the market.WIRELESS DELAYI am sensitive to wireless delays, mice, keyboard, headsets all bug me.  For me, this is a big deal.  Delays are a major issue with wireless products, especially if you have used BT 4.0 or earlier with headsets or other devices.  Since this uses 2.4GHz, it naturally has a delay closer to that of WiFi than the inherit delay with BT.  Couple that with a good design which is easy to use, and you can raise the antenna if needed, I don't even feel this delay.EVERYTHING ELSEOverall, it is packed with a lot of nice features and the rest is gravy.  The sound cancelling is nice, and the ability to pass outside sound in so you can hear your wife when she talks helps keep you out of trouble.  The software was easy to setup, and use, but leads me really to my only small complaint.MY ONE COMPLAINTThe software, by default, enables game capture and other features around snipping / recording sections of gameplay.  I appreciate software which comes with this feature for those who want it (of which I am not one), but have it enabled by default and setup ready to go was annoying.  Add to that, it has an overlay which can be frustrating.  IMHO, disable those features and the software goes back to doing just it's job - managing your headset.",
          "=========== UPDATE 5 ============After the problem was finally fixed (see below), these are a great pair of headphones and do exactly what I need by allowing both Bluetooth and a PC audio feed simultaneously. I use them to watch content or take calls on my IPhone while gaming on the PC. They are comfortable, have great sound and function correctly now that the power save issues were fixed by updated firmware.=========== UPDATE 4 ============It is a month after the firmware update, and I have not had to do a manual reset once. This completely proves that the original issue, the one they wanted me to return the headset over, was a software problem and not a defective headset.Think of it this way: if I had done what they had asked, returned it to Amazon for a replacement, I would have had EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUE because it would have been using the same buggy firmware.This should be a lesson to the product manager and service manager at SteelSeries:1) don't be lazy2) don't treat customers like they are stupid - in this case I knew more about your headset than you did3) don't antagonize customers and make them do useless work unless you are OK getting bad reviews=========== UPDATE 3 ============I attempted to follow their RMA instructions, but they changed their mind and suggested I return it to Amazon instead.Meanwhile, I had come to understand what was triggering the headset firmware crashes, and I am able to avoid them by carefully ensuring that both bluetooth and native sides of the headset are off before connecting it to USB for charging. By following this procedure, I was able to reduce the resets to one or two per week.THEN THEY PUSHED A FIRMWARE UPDATE THAT FIXED THE PROBLEM. Around Dec 20, SteelSeries pushed a firmware update (Tsmit version 0.1.11.0, Headset version 1.13, BT version 1.8) AND IT COMPLETELY FIXED THE PROBLEM.So I was correct, their FW was the problem the whole time, and their support was too rigid and inflexible to deal with this issue the correct way.Good headset, lousy software / support team.=========== UPDATE 2 ============After living with the \"headset goes unresponsive after 12 hours of idle, reset with paperclip\" for a couple of weeks, it was happening every 2-3 days. Support email indicated early on they'd like to RMA the unit for a replacement, though they didn't do any troubleshooting (2 day turnaround?!) so they seem to think every problem is faulty hardware. I'm doing the RMA with faint hope this is a faulty unit, rather than just buggy firmware.=========== UPDATE =============As I was packing this up for return, I tried using a much longer paperclip in the opposite earpiece as described in the support video. Instead of the earpiece with the mic, I used the opposite one - and with the longer paperclip, I was able to get a reset. Now the headset is working again.This appears to be a problem with the software's auto power save - it won't wake up. Now, because the company has no support communication - they don't know about this bug, so it will simply keep happening. What a terrible experience this is.==============================I had a prior generation, bought this to replace it after the USB charging port broke.After normal use after opening, charging and performing the required \"critical update\" from within the comical and trashy desktop app, the next morning the headset just stopped working. The mic light went red and no amount of button pushing or connecting/disconnecting would get a response. Also - the online instructions for how to power reset other models DID NOT WORK for these, leaving me no further troubleshooting options.Normally, I'd call support and get their help - but SteelSeries has no chat or voice options, just a TWO BUSINESS DAY RESPONSE EMAIL FORM.I would NEVER AGAIN buy anything made by this company - they do not know how to make decent software, and go deaf and dumb when the product fails. How can they charge for this?",
          "I upgraded to this wireless headset coming from a Razer Blackshark Wireless V2 Pro since I was getting dissatisfied with it after 2 years of usage. (Audio crackling, battery life loss, and loss of patience with Razer Software). (Razer mice are fine but I found their wireless headsets to be meh).  This Steelseries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless is a noticeable improvement with better sound, battery life, and non-cancerous software. I enjoy the easy ability to use Steelseries sonar to set audio settings for media consumption vs gaming. So far it is just as comfortable as the Razer Blackshark (Which was quite comfortable). I haven't tested the microphone since I use a dedicated USB microphone but I'd imagine it would be adequate for what it is. The ability to use a Bluetooth connection is also great because I can switch to my other devices semi-seamlessly, which I couldn't do with my previous headset.  Overall this is a comfortable wireless headset at a fair price considering the competition; it doesn't have active noise cancellation but has a fairly good sound isolation when playing loud sound from the headset.",
          "AMAZING battery life, GREAT sound quality, comfort is good. thought It'll be way more comfortable",
          "Everything worked well out of the package, with just two notes:1. the sidetone was turned on automatically and was very loud, as in just breathing softly is loud. It could be easily turned off in the software (but of course, you have to download it and setup an account). This was the \"low\" setting on sidetone, so unless you want to hear your own breath I would recommend leaving it off.2. The ear cups don't have much depth, so it took me some adjustment to find a position where my ears weren't being pressed in by the speakers. After I found this spot though, they have been comfortable.I am not an audiophile, but I have no complaints about the sound quality of both the speakers and mic. The build feels solid, without feeling like it applies too much pressure.",
          "If it doesn\u2019t turn on after charging, plug into computer > left ear > reset button hole",
          "I bought these for gaming, and general use with conference calls, watching videos, listening to music, etc.  Overall, I'm pleased with the sound quality.  I'm not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, so I have no benchmark to compare these to regarding frequency response, range, etc.  I do know that they are comfortable to wear, and I get quality \"signal\" reports from other folks when making phone calls and joining  online meetings.  My gaming friends also tell me I sound fine.  The battery life is fantastic, and I can charge them in a few minutes by simply plugging them  into a USB line to the computer.  You can also use them in wired mode when the battery is low.  These are NOT noise cancelling headphones, so if you're looking for something to block out background noise, or provide a \"full quieting\" experience, these are not it.  If you're looking for an affordable, comfortable, reliable headset for general use, they're fantastic.",
          "Very good product, maybe best the best Headphone i ever had.",
          "For a wireless headset that you are looking to only drop $100-300 on, this is the best I've tested. Turtle Beach Stealth Gen 2 came awfully close, but I felt the tuning on this was better, even after playing around with the settings. I did try the Nova Pro, but these are a bit more comfortable (breathable and no ANC bud touching your ear), and I could only recommend the Pro for only the looks or if you have multiple platforms you wish to hook up into the headset. Otherwise, for a console use for wireless, this is hard to beat!",
          "After 4 years of use, my Arctis 7 headset finally failed (one ear muffs snapped). Out of all the headsets I've owned, between Razer, Logitech, and HyperX - the Arctis 7 was the best one.I read some reviews on the Nova 7 and they looked promising, but the reviews were definitely not taking into account the previous generations.The biggest change that I disliked was the chatmix was now fully software based, rather than having two dedicated drivers for chat and gaming. To use chatmix, you MUST use the Sonar software - while the software is impressive with the customization options, it adds unecessary bloat to my PC and creating 4 virtual audio devices. What I liked about the Arctis 7 was being able to just plug it in, turn on Dolby Atmos for Headphones and be done - this offered amazing sound quality for both gaming and music.The last thing is the sound quality is definitely worse than the Arctis 7 headsets. On default settings, it's noticeably more flat, the spacial surround in Sonar sounds straight up inferior to the previous generation, even after messing around with the EQ settings.There are some Pros - the Nova 7 is noticeably lighter, almost half the weight just by holding both headsets in my hands, the Bluetooth connectivity was a plus as I can take calls while gaming, the battery life is no joke and USB-C charging was a big win.Sadly the Pros don't outweigh the cons in this case, I ended up returning and am going to try the Arctis 9 as it seems to be the last good headset Steelseries made - basically the Arctis 7 but with Bluetooth.",
          "Sound is solid. = Have used for gaming, films, tv, music. the quality is good. App is meh = I use a gaming laptop with Nahimic, and the fact that these 2 audio things can come together since they are Steelseries is really trash. I get popping if I mess with either app. definitely not good at working together and both will try to \"Improve\" the audio. Mic is trash = Leave it muted. If you need to use it, woof.Its garbage.In the day and age where a Bluetooth earbud can have amazing quality, we get a $150+ headset for gaming with a garbage mic that sounds worse than the $20 headset i used 20 years ago.  Id still roll a Sound Card and External Mic if headsets weren't required for shooters.No Bluetooth. WIFI Dongle connectivity only.Only reason I went with this over the 9 or 9+ was the 30hour battery life. I can stream for 27+ hours on one charge. Believe it or not it happens often enough. twitch.tv/kaezlo ;)",
          "After being in love with my previous SteelSeries headset, I decided to go with another one. I chose this one because the simultaneous bluetooth support. It's a super easy way to listen to my phone while gaming. If you don't have small ears, this thing is pretty painful after an hour or two. My ears are constantly being pressed on by this headset. I'm continually trying to adjust it, but nothing really works. As soon as I can find a replacement cushion, I'm definitely going to be in love with this headset again!",
          "I bought this headset to replace my old arctis pro wireless headset when the wires broke from the earcup being loose and moving around. It was the once with hot swappable batteries but i decided this time around I didn't need those since the Arctis Nova 7 has a ~38 hour battery life.The problem is that the charge indicator is poorly designed. The green light comes on at over 50% and theres nothing in the manual on if the light turns off when the battery hits full. I feel like this is going to force a lot of users to incompletely charge their headset since they dont know if its at 50%, 60%, 70%, 90%, or 100% since all those points are green. Even the cheapest products I've bought that run on a rechargeable battery has a way to tell you the batter is 100% charged. I expect more from a almost $200 purchase.I also dislike how when the headset volume is maxed out the mic sound gets returned to the headset. If I don't turn the headset up this isn't doesn't exist but its still annoying to have to turn down the volume of the headset just because steelseries couldn't keep the mic and headset signals completely separate.The overall weight and feel of the headset is pretty good. Overall I recommend the buy but I do wonder how long the lifespan of the battery will end up being.",
          "I finally know how to use my headset. It took some trial and error, mostly because I've never used a wireless headset with some of these features, and never this brand. I hope the information helps you.Now that I've gotten everything figured out, I am having a great experience with this headset. Here are the things I've learned:Left earcup: The rearmost button mutes the mic. If you have the boom extended, the mic will have a glowing red (and annoying) stripe. There is probably a way to turn that off, but as far as I can tell, the mic works perfectly well fully retracted. So when that button is raised, the mic is muted. When it's pressed in, it's live. I like that tactile system better.Volume knob: Slide it to the rear to increase, to the front to decrease. I recommend staring in the lower 1/2 of the dial the first time you use these.Ports and stuff: I'll let the manual handle these. Reminder, you can use the headset wired using the USB cable that comes with the headset (or I guess any USB cable that has USB-C on at least 1 end).Right earcup: This is where I had trouble figuring things out. The knob is the chatmix knob, which should let you adjust the strength of your media volume against the strength of the volume in whatever chat app you're using. To the rear for media, to the front for chat. I had the wheel halfway between the halfway mark and the front, and all the volume for the media I was streaming was super quiet. I thought maybe the headset had a volume limiter, but per support, it does not. Instead of trying all the 'pull off the foam and reset/ reinstall everything' that was already a fresh install, almost by accident I found out that if you have the knob halfway (has a nice little click or bump when you hit the middle), the volume is fine. I currently have mine halfway between the halfway mark and all the way back. If I need to adjust it, I know how now.Side Tone: This is a software feature. It lets you hear what your mic is picking up. HEAVEN FORBID you accidentally rub your arm or your sleeve over the mics while this feature is on. It nearly scared the life out of me until I figured out how to turn that off. It's in the software.That's about it, I'm having fun playing with the EQ in Sonar to get the sound exactly as I like it, and the headset is as nice and loud as I'd like it to be. Definitely glad I made this purchase, upgrading to a wireless headset has been life-changing already.OH! And the range. I have a 1 br apartment, 1 bath, kitchen, living area, dining area. If you think of the living area as the front right quadrant, bedroom rear left, bathroom rear right and dining room front left: I was able to travel to every far corner of the apartment with no problem. I am not taking this outside while the dongle is on my PC, so it has all the range I need. People with large ranch or multi-level homes, your experience may vary, but it's certainly not as bad as some reviews made it sound.Also the headband and ear cups are every bit as comfortable as nearly every says they are.Enjoy!",
          "I first bought the arctis 7. Phenomenal headset fir PS5 even though its not the 7p version.I wanted simultaneous Bluetooth connection so i returned the 7 and bought the 9. The right earcup is quieter than the left. The mic has crackling and popping noises. When Bluetooth is turned on their is a dead air sound.The only issue i had with the 7 was lack of Bluetooth. The 9 has better base but i found the eq more difficult to fine tune despite being the same 10 pass slider. The 9 had more options like adjusting the surround sound but that only affects PC from what i can tell. I found the 9 more comfortable becauae it had more clamping force from the ear cups whereas the 7 was mostly the band resting on the top of my head. But the 7s earcups were nuch nicer feeling. The mic on the 7 sounds much better but the 9 does a better job of blocking background noise. The 7 uses USB C and the 9 sadly uses micro usb for some reason. At first the 9 had much better range than the 7 did but after a while it was about as mediocre as the 7 was. Perhaps its my environment. But the Turtle beach 700 i tried didn't have this issue. The 7 rarely has slight audio distortion at max volume which most people probably won't notice.IMPORTANT FOR PS5 OWNERS: if you use an Ethernet cable and have a usb hard drive plugged in the back of the PS5 you will either need to plug the 9 in front or get a usb extender. The headset uses an L shape USB plug which blocks either the Ethernet slot or the 2nd USB slot and blocks the USB C slot on front. The Arctis 7 uses a USB C plug which you can plug into the front but will block the big USB A slot but also comes with a USB C to USB A extension which is unobtrusive.Overall the 9 was a sad disappointment after being blown away by the 7. If Bluetooth isn't important to you then i don't think there is any better option than the Arctis 7+. You cannot use a 3.5mm headphone jack while the 7 is on it will turn off to use the jack.",
          "I don\u2019t have a small head but these feel loose like they\u2019re gonna fall of my head if I lean forward or backward. They\u2019re very comfortable if you\u2019re sitting upright though. Sounds quality is pretty basic in my opinion. No bass. Not very loud. The microphone is the main reason I got these and that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping them at four stars. The mic is very good. I like how the tip glows red when you mute it. The chat mix in discord doesn\u2019t work very well or at least it isn\u2019t intuitive to set up. The lag to the wireless receiver is amazingly negligible. Pairing and swapping devices is very quick and simple once you get the hang of it. Not impressed with the feedback sounds for on/off/paired/muted, they seem very cheap and harsh for how well-designed they\u2019re supposed to be. I wish these had Bluetooth.",
          "I'm the one that generally skimps on headsets. So anyone who does similar here is my simple take-away...Charges quick!I wear it for work (MS teams) and gaming (Discord)Took me a bit to figure out that the mic works (very well) while its retracted.Best quality from extended mic>>> Place the boom just above your chinMic picks up your voice and nothing else.Great soundGreat look/feel/comfort. Few headsets have a band AND a low profile.",
          "Swapped over from Arctis 1 Wireless to this pair. Have been using them for over a month; daily use on PC.Pros:- Amazing battery life: even when they do run out, the USB-C charging speed is crazy fast- Incredibly comfortable for short/long sessions: good padding on ear cups and good distribution of the weight across the ski mask-style headband- Build quality: For the price, I would expect this to be a solid pro, which it is. Overall feels premium- Adjustable sound: Inside the SteelSeries GG app, you can adjust the EQ of the headset through pre-made profiles or do it yourself. I found that the base one sounds pretty decent but the mids do get a bit lost at times. Again, you can change it around all you want, so I wouldn't be too worried about the audio balancing; especially on PC.Cons:- Cost: For the price, there are several other options in the market, but I do believe that this is easily one of the top 3 in its price range- Mic: I don't personally ever use it, but the one time that I had to wasn't a great sound. Pretty common with most SteelSeries headsets, however, so I don't think this model is the exception. I do like how it contracts into the headset flush though.",
          "I bought this as a gift for my husband. He wanted good quality headphones for PC gaming. I got him these and he said the sound quality is great, he was able to hear some things that he didn\u2019t hear before and was able to win because of it.",
          "These sound great, The only problem it if window 11 update or some other software the has to reset my laptop, I have to play with GG to get them back up and able to  listen to anything other then usb or blue-tooth.",
          "For all the hype around SteelSeries headphones I decided to give them a try, replacing my Razer Blackshark v2.  Comfort level is below average, frequent crackling noise through the headphones.  If I didn\u2019t already give my Blacksharks to my kid, I would most certainly go back to them.  They sounded just as good but were way more comfortable than the Nova 7.",
          "I have used Arctis 7 Wireless(2019 version) for 3 years so far. The battery was not holding much juice, and the Mic cable sheathing ripped (This did not affect functionality). So I decided to upgrade to Nova 7 Wireless.Pros: Similar sound quality, good battery life, USB-C charging and dongle. These are self-explanatory.Cons: Stupid GG Sonar software, bad QC.- Arctis 7 has native chat-mix without any software. Nova 7 chat-mix does not work without GG. Sometimes the software will bug out after PC is put to sleep, causing an error that requires the software to be restarted. That's a major annoyance.  Steelseries really did not need to change something that is not broken.- My first pair had microphone issue where it sounded scratchy and sometimes not pick up sound. When music was played, sometimes audio gets cut off. Fine, I got a lemon and returned it. Second replacement pair came and had none of the issues above. Roughly 2 weeks later, the right ear-cup started buzzing high pitched sound only when powered on.I had high hope because Arctis 7 was exceptional. I ended returning the replacement and soldered an aftermarket battery to my old trusty Arctis 7. Now I am frustration free.",
          "Overall sound quality is great, mic is outstanding but there is one fall through. From time to time the mic will disconnect from discord and my only solution is to unplug the receiver from my pc and reconnect it. other than that I have has no issues with this headset.",
          "I game A LOT and been through several headsets over the years. I picked this up because my Arctis 1 started having mic issues along with audio issues. Imo this is the best headset you can get without being tethered to a gaming dac which is something I'd like to get some day but more wires is not desirable for me rn.I play a lot of Apex and this picks up footsteps a lot clearer and more accurately.The sonar software on PC is awesome but takes time to setup and get to your liking.Plug and play with PS4/PS5/PC (if you don't like to fiddle with settings that is)/Switch is a huge bonus.I've never had a headset that had a fabric band for support and my god have I been missing out, this thing is comfortable as hell. As for the ear cups they're comfortable for me however I have read several reviews across all Steel Series headsets and everyone complains about them being uncomfortable. I guess if you have ears that stick out more these would not be ideal and you may want to switch them out with aftermarket ones.As for music, these are good but I still find myself wanting more even after spending 2 hrs tweaking frequencies. Don't get me wrong they're loud as hell but if you're a true audiophile you'll know what I'm talking about.The mic is extremely sensitive and I may add a piece of foam over mine. The headset provides feedback so you can know it's working and I never realized how much shit could be picked up until now. I'm definitely adjusting my settings more so people don't get annoyed with me (I have asthma so I breathe heavier than normal and I didn't really realize it until I got this headset lol) but the clarity my friends hear is crystal on their side. I also really like the light on the mic, if it's muted it's red and I can see it out of my peripheral vision. I spent so much time checking to see if I was muted or not with my Arctis 1 that this minor detail brings a quality of life improvement I didn't know I wanted.The power button on this is also very responsive. Anyone that's used the Arctis 1 will know it takes an eternity for it to turn off. This headset, is less than a second and it beeps and turns off.This came with several cords as well for different connections which I applaud. USB C is amazing, 3.5mm Jack, and then another one I'm really not sure what its called but it also acts as a 3.5mm.Overall this is a 4.8/5 stars for me. Would definitely recommend anyone to pick this up.",
          "Brother likes the headphones",
          "The Arctis Nova 7 is by far the best gaming headset I have owned. The headset is sleek and feels well made. It is not as bulky as previous headsets I have owned and has a lot of features. The audio quality is great, and music, multiplayer voice chat, and game audio all come through very well. The microphone is decent, but occasionally suffers from tinny audio according to some of my friends who I game with. I find the headset to be extremely comfortable to wear, although any gaming headset will cause a bit of neck fatigue over a long period; this one could be lighter.Although I primarily use this on PS5, I am glad it is multi-platform in case I decide to use it with other systems. The dual 2.4GHz and Bluetooth is nice to have so I can use my phone or listen to music while gaming, and the pairing process was quick and easy. The dongle to connect to the PS5 is small and convenient, provides a virtually lag-free 2.4GHz connection, and connects automatically every time I power on the PS5 and headset without fail. The battery life is fantastic, I am a casual gamer and can go days or weeks between charges. Overall this is an excellent headset.Overall: 5/5Features: 5/5Audio: 5/5Microphone: 4/5Ergonomics: 4/5Ease of use: 5/5",
          "I have gone through many headsets over the years including Razer and Corsair. I then was told about this particular headset.The volume knobs and switches are amazing and work perfectly.  The buttons toggle without shorts or issues.The light on the mic does not always come on when the mic is muted so I sometimes wind up talking to my friends for like 15-20 minutes before I realize that I was muted and they never heard a word I said.The software is really good, but the sonar settings in the device software program resets your settings when sound devices change in windows.  This is extremely annoying and I feel should be corrected asap.The chat mix knob is a brilliant way to add a little more additional control over what programs are louder in your ears.I highly  suggest this as a headset for anybody and I would even go as far as to say that is the best I have owned and/or used.",
          "The headset mic is definitely not the best but it is fairly clear where none of your friends will complain. Very convenient to pull in and out when you need it. Default sound is good but the EQ program really changes the sound experience for you. For the price it's really good in my opinion, no complaints. Though, volume wheel sometimes scrolls down and I think the headset is undetected, but I make sure to check that so it's not an issue. Also very comfortable for long computer sessions.",
          "For what these are made for, I think they're great. The audio quality is good enough, and the Steelseries software comes with some decent EQ options. The surround sound is very clear, so in fps games it's easy to tell where sounds are coming from. The mic is probably my favorite mic I've used in a headset. There's a good noise gate system, so nobody is gonna hear you breathing in the mic or any other minor background noise.For the record, I bought these used from Amazon renewed. I can't speak for anyone else's experience, but mine may as well have been new. I've had zero issues after a few months of every day use.I'd recommend these if you want a good all-around option. They aren't going to be the \"best quality\" in any one regard, but it does everything very well for the price.",
          "I\u2019ve noticed a few issues and not sure how to resolve as far as audio. There was a brief pause, roughly about 1-2 seconds of silence then back to regular audio for another 7seconds or so then the pause again.It took me a whole day to figure this out and I\u2019m still not sure what fixed it. I restarted my pc, replugged and reconnected the headphones\u2026. Then today, it\u2019s staticky as if it was a messed up aux cord that needed a spin in your old 2000s Honda civic if you know what I mean.Other than this, audio sounds fine and it\u2019s mostly fixed with a restart or just fumbling around with settings. Though again, not sure what the actual solutions were and of the one month I\u2019ve owned these (I turn them on almost daily and use for at least 5 hours) the sound issues happened roughly 7-8 times.I\u2019m a female who games and streams; I find these SUPER comfortable and can have them on 12 hours straight. HOWEVER, it feels loose. I cannot confidently lay down or move too much other than the standard seated gaming position. The headband is adjustable but looks like a floating band with 3 inches of space (very egg like) so I just keep them loose and sit still. Would I recommend these? Maybe not but they\u2019re still on the list as it features really cool options like audio separation.For example, while gaming if I\u2019m hearing friends in discord and listening to music all at the same time, I can touch the knob in my right hand instead of clicking around to open discord and adjusting each friends voice lower.How cool is that!!! Because of this, I\u2019m likely keeping these but if you find me another pair that are comfortable and can do this I would 100% switch.I\u2019m not an audiophile either but playing games like Apex, you can really hear footsteps clearly and get immersed in game easily. It\u2019s just awkward because now I have no excuse for my dmg score.",
          "They sent me the incorrect headphones at first and it took almost a month to get the correct one. Other then that, excellent headphones.",
          "Sound quality is decent especially after tweaking in the Sonar app. Fit for me is quite loose though and needs more clamping force.",
          "Great headset recommended \ud83d\udc4c",
          "I don\u2019t often write reviews, but these headphones are awesome.ComfortThese headphones are extremely comfortable. The skin and style head strap gets the fit just right on my ears and I can wear them for a long time.They don\u2019t put a lot of pressure on your ears so glasses can be worn very easily with these. The headphones are oval so they fit most ears I would imagine.I specifically got this headphone because it\u2019s mostly fabric based. My old razer had fake leather that chipped over the years and had to throw it out. This one the ear cushions are some special material and they don\u2019t make my ears hot or uncomfortable or anything.SoundThey sound great. They are little quiet though I find myself setting the volume to max.RangeThe range is awesome I can take conference calls all over the house and still here. Built in mic button is great.UsbThe usb works great and I use it on a monitor usb hub which is then plugged into a usb switcher so I\u2019m able to use the headset with multiple computers using a KVM switch type of device but it\u2019s only for usb devices. No issues with this weird setup I have.MicThe microphone is ok. I used to have an old razer kraken usb headset and the mic on the razer filters out loud keyboard clicks a lot better. Basically typing with the razer you couldn\u2019t hear my max cherry brown switches. The steel series easily picks it up and unless you use software to filter it out like the steel series app or meeting software like google chat or teams it could be an issue for you. I think this is the weakest point on this headset.BatteryBattery is awesome. It has auto off so I find it\u2019s never dead. I put one of those magnetic usb c adapter things on it from Volta and I\u2019m able to essentially \u201cdock\u201d it to an under desk mount and magnetically charge it. It works great and the usb c is awesome to see. Supposedly this headphone gets 40 hours of usage and I think that\u2019s accurate and it\u2019s one of the best on the market according to Rtings.SummaryHighly recommend this to PC users who want to use it for both gaming as well as meetings.",
          "Having had an Arctic 5 RGB set for years I was looking to upgrade to something wireless, but also not have to go into Pro series territory.  The 7+ (not to be confused with the 7P+) seemed the logical choice.With 30hrs battery life, no RGB to fuss with (nice if you kind of like a simple headset aesthetic), great 7.1 emulation via Sonar and a solid mic... this set is for you.  It uses a USB-C cable to charge (included), as well as includes the standard USB-C receiver, but also a USB-A to USB-C cable for those without USB-C on their machine.Battery life is amazing at 30hrs per charge, so far so good there, and performance has been great.  You do need to use the Steel Series app to get things working, but its pretty simple and only takes a few minutes to setup and configure (just turn on Spacial sound for 7.1).  The standalone chat/game audio mixer knob is gone with a wireless set, and in turn its a standard scroll wheel on the RIGHT ear (left is volume).Honestly, I was quite happy with my Arctis 5's but was looking for a slight bump up and to remove the cables.  I am not dissapointed at all.  I do find myself trying to 'move' the cable that doesn't exist anymore out of habit, but i'll mark that as a win for them since it shows the performance is at or greater (greater in this case) than what it replaced to where I still stay in my gaming habits.If you're looking for a solid gaming headset with some flexibility, gaming performance, great battery life and ease of use... I highly recommend these.  If wireless is not your thing I recommend the ARCTIS 5 series as they treated me solid for over 2yrs as well!",
          "Definitely worth the money. I'd say my only issue is sometimes it will disconnect itself from discord, I'm sure it's probably just discord half the time",
          "I work for a call center and my old standby (nothing even remotely close to this headset) was starting to go out. I wanted to splurge a bit because of a recent promotion, so I went and tried on headsets at Best Buy. Of course, I fall in love with the ones that are out of stock there. So I came to amazon, ordered them, and they arrived the next day (I paid extra shipping). I've used this headset for two shifts so far, and I've gotten compliments about the audio quality compared to my last set. I haven't used them to game (though I eventually will, I just don't get as much time to do that as I'd like), but for work I've absolutely enjoyed this set. I like the microphone retracting into the headset itself and also that it lights up red when the mic is muted. They definitely do a great job, and I like that it can connect to not only my PCs, but also my switch.I'm not super into knowing what makes the audio good or bad, so please don't use this review for that. But having worked 16 hours using this headset, I can say it's super comfortable.",
          "I am no audiophile, but the sound quality on these is noticeably better than any gaming headset I've tried in the past. And if it isn't up to your standards, their software makes it really easy to tune the EQ. The GG/Sonar software is also really great and easy to use.The wireless functionality is SO convenient. I sometimes forget that I don't have to take them off in order to stand up and walk away because I'm not literally tied to my PC by a cord anymore. Also the fact that I can use them with my PC, get up and open my laptop, and start listening to music over bluetooth without messing with any buttons or settings... Amazing. I had no idea how much I needed this feature in my life.I spent the last 6 years with the Arctis 5 headset and the Nova 7 is a huge step up. Highly recommend.",
          "I think this headset is pretty good, except for PC, Sonar is a nightmare. When I first booted them up, the audio was very hollow and distant compared to my previous headphones. I tried experimenting with the EQ, but nothing I did fixed the hollow sound of the audio. It wasn't until I turned off Sonar where the audio actually became pretty good, everything sounded clear and there was no audio delay. I have no idea how it is for console plays but if you plan to get these for PC use, MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF SONAR.",
          "Huge improvement for my PS5. Can use the online app to dial in the sound and boost the volume beyond the present limits.",
          "Overall I like this headset, but it does have a few flaws.Pros:-Sound quality, the sound quality sounds good to me, for music or gaming. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not super picky in this regard.-Battery life is long.-Comfort. It is pretty comfortable and not as heavy as some other wireless headsets like the Hyper X Cloud II. I have the Cloud II which is a good headset, but it was so heavy and the clamping force was too much for my jaw. The Arctis 7+ is a little lighter and not as tight on my jaw. I also really like the flexible headband design, which I couldn't find on any other headset and is a large part of the reason I went with this headset.Cons:-Build quality. I used to have the Arctis 5 wired headset, and the Arctis 7+ is noticeably of lower quality. Namely the earpad foam and covering. The headband is also a thin piece of metal with very little padding. The edges are very thin and it does not feel good to pick it up by the headband. Nothing to grab onto.-The chatmix settings are locked behind their proprietary \"Sonar\" software. No idea why this was necessary. Probably to essentially force people to download it. The older Arctis headsets are NOT like this. Now I haven't any problems with the software as others have written in their reviews, so this isn't a dealbreaker to me but it might be to some.-Dongle is USB-C and some people may not have that on older PC's. It does come with a USB-C to USB adapter, but the whole point of a wireless headset is to have less wires.-No Bluetooth compatibility.",
          "So these are by far the best sounding headset I've tried in terms of gaming, especially for fps games where positional ques are important. These headphones by far does performs the best and I was able to pinpoint where each gunshot was coming from. All the other headphones I tried (Logitech G935, Hyper X Flight S, ROG Delta S) did not compare, with Logitech G935 coming in the closest to sound quality while ironically, the ROG Delta S came in sounding the worst. I was planning to give ROG a second chance with their 4 channel driver Theta 7.1 headset, but after using these headsets, I'm just gonna scrap that plan and settle with this. The only negative I will complain about is the GG Sonar software adding 2-3 additional playback devices named \"SteelSeries Sonar - Game/Chat/Microphone\" to windows playback menu. This makes it hard to navigate thru the list and select the desired audio device. But other than little complaint, I am absolutely loving this headset. I have yet to run out of battery life on this thing so I can believe it when they say 30 hours per charge.",
          "Quick background, skip if uninterested: I\u2019m absolutely not an audiophile so this review doesn\u2019t come from a place of incredible pickiness. My old (and cheap) headset broke in the middle of playing online with friends. I was very upset and rushed to Best Buy that evening in an attempt to quickly replace it. Needless to say I was tempted into buying something else(a different \u201cgamer headset\u201d brand) and hated it a lot. After fighting with that horrible setup for a few hours, I decided to order the Arctis 7+ here.Start of review for the particular 7+ model I bought off here:DELIVERY- I ordered it and it arrived wayyy earlier than I expected. I was so excited to try it out. So far I\u2019ve used them them for about 2-3 months.COMFORTABLE- I can say they\u2019re very very comfortable. Even after some 10 hour play sessions, I almost forget they\u2019re there and bump them. The pads around the ears are a perfectly soft material. They\u2019re a soft fabric material that does not break down like I\u2019ve noticed the smooth fake leather to. These also don\u2019t get too hot around my ears thanks to the breathable padding material.I have long hair and OTHER headphones tend to grab and pull out my hair a lot- I haven\u2019t had that issue with this set except a couple times where the fault was all on me because I pulled a joint area through my hair. Otherwise, it seems it\u2019s really hard for this to happen on accident like my other sets always did (Owwy!)Unlike most other headphones, this set has an elastic- yet soft- band under the headband that pretty much suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting their weight directly on the top of your scalp. I find that this design choice really improves the comfort for me, as with other headphone sets the weight and rigidity of the headband start to hurt over time. The Bluetooth feature on this also allows me to sit back, play from a couch, or go get a drink (important!) while still talking to my friends.SOUND QUALITY- I once again want to remind that I am no audiophile. After getting these and starting some gameplay, I immediately noticed highs and lows I wasn\u2019t hearing from my old headsets. Little environmental sounds, instruments in soundtracks I never noticed or heard before, subtle feedback sounds from button presses and menus, I recall calling them out to my friends and them being equally surprised I now noticed them.One of my personal gripes with modern headphones lately is that every company wants to make super bassy sounding headphones, as the average person associates quality with bass for some reason. Out of the box, all of the sound levels for these are perfect in my opinion, not too bassy or anything. If you wanted bassy headphones out of this though, you could easily just go in and change that using the steel series sound control app. I haven\u2019t changed anything myself because I like how they sound as is.Another thing I wanted was independent volume control for the headphones, which this has! Not only can you control the volume with a dial on the headset but you can also adjust wether you want chat or game sounds to be louder than the other on the headset. I was also concerned that audio quality may differ between wired or wireless connection, but everything seems fine regardless of connection type. Mic quality is decent for hanging out and talking to friends. We never have static issues, it never catches annoying background noise, no chirps, so far I\u2019ve heard no issue myself. The mic quality probably isn\u2019t something you\u2019d use for high quality production, like making videos, podcasts, or streaming. Though you probably could do any of those things if you\u2019re not a stickler for recording quality. I feel it\u2019s mainly a headset for comfortably gaming- a role it\u2019s more than fulfilled for me!NOISE CANCELLATION-  I\u2019m personally indifferent to wether my headsets have noise cancellation or not. I don\u2019t live in a particularly loud place, so I don\u2019t get to test this one out much. Every once in a while another family member may approach me to ask something, and I can hear them at that point, but not if they call from another room. The outer side of the mic has a small mic that picks up sound outside your headset and feeds it back to you with a subtle and quiet delay. I\u2019m not used to that myself but it does come in handy here and there. It does sometimes also trick me into thinking the headset mic is picking up and putting outside noise into my calls (it\u2019s not though, confirmed by friends). I\u2019m indifferent to this feature, as it hasn\u2019t caused me too much issue and I\u2019m pretty sure it can be turned off.OTHER FEATURES- The mic is posable and retracts, it\u2019s a pretty nice way to store the headset or just get the mic out of your peripheral vision until in use.There\u2019s a small button on the left side that mutes the mic, when muted the mic lights red, which is a pretty handy visual reminder as in the past I have often found myself talking for minutes on end to myself while in calls with friends (lol).The headset comes with some other wired connection options, even a headphone Jack option.To connect to your computer it DOES use a wired dongle, so if you are trying to save on USB port space, be aware it does take one.I\u2019m not sure how to measure this, the Bluetooth connectivity works throughout my whole room and even in the rooms immediately over. I am usually able to go to my kitchen and prepare myself food or drinks while still enjoying music or talking, so long as the battery has a decent charge.The battery life is REALLY good. I personally have always made it a habit to charge anything when I\u2019m not using it, so I never see it die. BUT to vouch for its lifetime- one time I didn\u2019t realize the USB end of my cord wasn\u2019t plugged into my computer until after a week of thinking I had been charging it nightly after game sessions and daily use. This thing lasted a whole week of /at least/ 6-8 hour use daily with absolutely no charging that whole time before I just happened to pull on the usb for it and find it had never been plugged back in that whole week. So for sure with this headset, unless you\u2019re playing insanely all the time with the highest volume in use, you\u2019ll never see it die so long as you check it in for a charge here and there!End summary: Overall I can say I\u2019m very happy with this headset. Definitely has become my favorite one. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset suited best for comfortable gaming and chatting. I was skeptical of Bluetooth functionality before buying, but it has WELL PAST won me over.",
          "My daughter loved them great set of headphones",
          "I know it's probably not fair to compare these to the previous Arctis Pros, but I was hoping that I could save some money on getting these as my pros have died.Pros: comfort is still very nice with the updated band, they're a little lighter and less bulky and it is noticeably nicer to wear, sound quality is just meh for music but I'm not an audiophile so it's actually fine compared to the pros to meCons: the connection between the headphones and the engine is terrible. it showed the battery life once and it never showed up again no matter how many times i tried to reconnect. any time i tried to make a settings change and saved it, the sound completely cut out and i'd have to reconnect. that might be a minor detail if you set it once and never have to do it again but had to reset things with the firmware update. I am using a mac, maybe that's the reason? the range of the headphones also seems a little short, even moving the dongle into a more open area of my apartment.overall these have just not been a smooth experience, which I suppose going from the higher end model to this is to be expected, though I would think steelseries could make the software work more seamlessly for a better product overall. adjusting sound settings shouldn't make your headphones crackle and sound like they die and have to make you reconnect.",
          "**Arctis 7+ model.**I bought this headset because I was looking for something at a reasonable price, that can provide a comfortable experience, sounds excellent, and looks nice. This headset excels in all of those categories but goes even further beyond. It has phenomenal sound, is very very comfortable (thanks to the ski strap design), and looks so much cleaner than pretty much any headset on the market. I have seen many complaints about the headset relying on software too much, and I'm going to clear that up. Once in a while (maybe 1/10 times I power on the headset) the SteelSeries GG software will make me set an input and output device. However, this only involves me having to click a drop-down menu two or three times and select a device. This only takes about 10 seconds. Other than that the software basically works on its own, and doesn't need any adjusting other than personal preferences. You can in fact use this headset on anything with a USB-C port, besides an Xbox of course, even if it doesn't have the SteelSeries software installed.The mic on this headset is by no means amazing, but it also does not sound bad whatsoever. It is pretty usable for everything except for streaming. Every time I've used it to talk, no one had trouble understanding what I was saying.More on the sound quality, it is honestly phenomenal. Because of the powerful software, you can tune every small detail to perfection. The surround sound immersion feature is surprisingly good as well. Listening to music, this feature made it very immersive and more enjoyable. Using it in games, I noticed having much more spatial awareness compared to some other headsets that I have used. I was able to tell where gunshots or footsteps were coming from very easily.Specifically, in Battlefield 5, i felt so much more immersed, like i was really running into battle, with planes and explosions surrounding me. This feature really goes unnoticed, and in my opinion, is very underrated.If you are looking for a comfortable headset, that can be used easily in games, or for listening to music, I highly recommend this product. It's fairly priced and provides so many incredible features(if you don't care for warranties, you can buy this headset renewed for just under $100!)",
          "It feels weird at first but give it a week so settle in. Side tone is turned on when you get them, you need to connect them to a PC and turn it off, I use them on my PS5, they have to be wired on Xbox, it does connect to PC . They are a little smaller than the arctis but u get use to it",
          "I have used a lot of steel series products in the past, and for the most part all of the items I\u2019ve used from this company were good, and only good. This headset is no exception, while Steel Series has built up on the old Arctis 7 and has given it an overhaul in almost all aspects including better battery life, and better sound quality, the microphone and software leave a lot to be sought after. The microphone quality seems to be worse than it\u2019s direct predecessor the Arctis 7, as I have an issue with it picking up too much noise around me, and tweaking the software for the headset has not fixed the issue. I understand when purchasing a steel series headset, I am receiving a product with your average gamer in mind, and for this price point I can look past the mediocre microphone and recommend this headset as a good product for your average gamer. I primarily play on pc so your results may vary on consoles.",
          "Upgrade from my Razer blackshark pro's they had bad range and after awhile they died quickly after 4 years. These have great sound and the software with Sonar is amazing, way better than any Razer software. Bought some wicked cushions to replace the factory ear cushions due to them having a nice gel cooling effect."

          "The headphones itself is very nice. I haven\u2019t notice the noise cancellation yet. I feel like this headphone is mainly for ps5 and anything that has a type c section or plug the adapter in to make it Bluetooth. Sadly, It is not Bluetooth for my ps4 controller",
          "Best headset i have ever owned. I use these for my PS5 mainly and I can say if youre this is in your budget, dont think twice!",
          "I e only had this for about a week but I do like them so far. It doesn't hug your head too tight, the audio from the speakers is awesome, the ear cushions are comfortable. I like that it has a push in button to mute your mic. I also like the retractable microphone and the way that it lights up red to let you know when your mic is muted. Best of all is the REALLY REALLY LONG battery life. I've had some long gaming sessions, like 9 hours straight, and they still had juice to get me through a few more days of gaming. This is the longest lasting battery I've ever had on a wifi headset. Highly recommend",
          "I recently purchased the Arctis 7P+ Wireless Gaming Headset and I have been pleased with its performance. The battery life is good and the build quality is solid. The sound quality is excellent and it is comfortable to wear for extended gaming sessions. The setup was easy and the wireless range works great. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",
          "Leaps and bounds better than the Logitech headset this replaced. Sound quality is much better and I haven't had any issues. My old Logitech wouldn't work after I had moved the mic to mute myself, I would have to turn headset off and re pair it with computer for it to work properly. No such issue with my steel series!",
          "I use this headset for playing online games on PlayStation with my online friends. This headset has been next to perfect for the role I picked it for. The sound quality for games like Apex, R - Six Siege, and Dead by Daylight is spot on. From what my friends have told me, the mic quality is also pretty crisp. Furthermore, the microphone comes with a notch on the side which allows you to increase or decrease the amount of background noise that you, the buyer, can hear. Note: This notch does not physically effect the way that others hear your audio, so it does not serve as a mute button. However, there is also a dedicated mute button on the opposite side of the headset. I would rate this product full stars, but after having the headset for a while, the muffs get used to your wear and will loosen a little bit. Which decreases a small amount of the sound suppression. Other than that, which IMO is not a big deal, this headset is perfect for all you gamers. It\u2019s great for music too!",
          "It has good battery life it a bit heavy on the head but overall decent headset for the price I would pay 100$ for it not 150$ but pretty satisfied with it just the cushions fell off and had to put them back on",
          "Not even 60 days in and it began to malfunction, wouldn\u2019t shut down, led lights stopped lighting, buttons no longer functioned. No manufacture warranty per them, only \u201ctrouble shooting\u201d, no exchanges, no refunds. Not worth it except for noise canceling\u2026when it worked. Volume also was never higher than a few decibels.***edit*** I could\u2019ve deleted this but I wanted to acknowledge that I was wrong. After I was responded to and told how to reset it, it work again. Volume is not as high as the turtle beaches 600, but it\u2019s still performs pretty good. Also I increased the star \u2b50\ufe0f on the review.",
          "I personally think they are a lil bit too expensive, but it is a nice headset. it's very comfortable and the audio quality is good.",
          "These are so worth the money, and SO much better than the Sony PS4 wireless cans I had. They are super comfortable, battery life is fantastic, sound quality is amazing... I can't think of any cons. All the rave reviews you've read are correct. Stop debating and just buy them - they are every bit as good as everyone says. I love mine, and will easily look for another set from SteelSeries to replace these when/if they finally bite the dust.",
          "For me, this headset is 4.5 out of 5. I actually dont prefer noise canceling headphones and have just been using crappy wired phone headphones for about 5 years (before that I used the same pair of turtle beaches for about 5 years). These have a pass through so you can still hear sounds outside the headphones which is key since I have kids. Its honestly a game changer if you still need to hear outside the game and don't worry it's not like a constant static, plus it's adjustable.Sound quality is fine, can easily hear foot steps in mw2(2). Doesn't blow me away or anything but gets the job done, no complaints.These are super comfy on the skull and ear cupping is fine. It's not super breathable but not uncomfortable. I don't game in long sessions anymore but have worn for about 3 hours with no complaints.Setting these up is freaking cake. Seriously. I'm on PC and all I did was connect the dongle to the USB adapter and plug the USB into my PC and boom, sound. My PC automatically switched output sound to the headphones but you might have to go into settings and switch it.Iv seen people complain about the red light when the mic is muted and all you have to do is lower the mic and turn it so the red light is facing down is a non-issue. Still picks up your voice no problem but that leads into my first complaint. The mic will pick up any and every sound in the house (and I'm in the basement). So having a full house I do need to mute my mic a lot but at least it's easy to do with a button on the headset. My only other complaint is the location of the volume and pass thru dials. Every single time I take off (or put on) my headset I hit those dials. It's an easy fix but it is an annoyance.Overall tho I am very very happy with my purchase. I did a ton of research on a plethora of headphones before buying these and would 100% buy again. Especially if your a dad (or mom) gamer.",
          "perfect for my needs",
          "Love this headset! I truly am spoiled now.",
          "bad",
          "Read many reviews, got the headset, felt that what I got is pretty consistent with the majority of reviews.  I will be using the headset for a very long time I think.The one con I have is that the depth of the ear cups is not deep enough. I don't have huge ears but even so, I often find myself adjusting the headset to remove uncomfortable pressure on my ears.  I also ofen can hear my heartbeat from the earpads reverberating that into my ears during quieter moments.  It is an uncomfortable feeling.For some reason there is not a star rating offered for comfort, and that makes no sense for a headphone",
          "I can\u2019t believe how great these sound and how accurate the 3D / spatial sound is for games like Call of Duty when using them with my PlayStation 5. They are a little lacking in bass but I always felt like the bass in my previous headset washed out the rest of the sound whenever grenades and other explosives were detonating. It\u2019s refreshing to still be able to hear what\u2019s going on around me even when there\u2019s a ton of back ground explosions and gunfire.I did use the Arctis software to develop a custom EQ setting and with that, this headset provides a definite competitive advantage in FPS multiplayer games.Battery life seems great\u2026i charged to full capacity the first day I had them and am just now (about 15 hours of use) putting them back on the charger. The LED in the headset changes colors to let you know where your charge level is at\u2026.Green 100-50% Yellow 49-20% and Red 19-0% I put them back on the charger as soon as the LED turned yellow.",
          "Very comfortable & great sound quality. Not good noise cancellation. Bluetooth connection is good. Battery life is good. With the buy.",
          "I use it with my PS5 and it helps me greatly with determining the direction of sound in the games, but I don't think it supports the PS5's 3D Audio system. It integrates seamlessly with the PS5 bluetooth interface. Noise cancelling is meh - it's mostly achieved by the immersion of sound from the games, not from any active cancellation system.  I like that the microphone retracts into the headset when you don't want to use it, thus keeping it out of the way. When retracted, the sound input is automatically muted. Separate controls for headset volume and microphone output. Battery life is very good - can go about 4 days (playing ~6hrs per day) without needing a recharge - and I like that I can recharge it while using it.",
          "Super comfortable headset. Great mic quality and amazing sound quality. Has a long lasting battery as well. Best headset I've ever owned",
          "These are amazing and my husband likes these so much more than the Sony pulse headphones which were too small for him. I bought bigger ear foams do that it fully covers his ears and he loves them.",
          "My favorite headset so far. For someone with a small head, it fits quite snug and comfortably. Usually my struggle with these types of headsets is the bulky feel but it's quite light. Only complaint is that it is quite sensitive and really picks up surrounding sounds. Background noise suppressors do help though if they are an option in the program. Sound quality overall is pretty good, crisp and clear.",
          "The sound is great with 3D sound with the ps5 but if you don't have that it sounds terrible. The headset feels cheap to be honest. I regret not buying the PS5 headset instead of this.",
          "These headphones are super comfy and relatively loud (obviously adjustable). I really enjoy the fact that you can customize your sounds, but it was difficult with my mac book at first. The sound quality is awesome and I would recommend to any type of gamer, especially with the customizable features on your computer. The headband style is something I didn\u2019t expect to be as comfortable as they are\u2026 I was quite skeptical but I am able to wear baseball caps with the headset and adjust as needed. The eat pieces are awesome. My only issue with the head set is the sensitivity of the mic, it can pick up a lot of noises\u2026 while this is good, sometimes it\u2019s not. Other than that, this is a great product and I would recommend giving these a rip!",
          "I am using this for PS5 and the sound quality is amazing! Can't beat being able to creep around in an fps and judging how close somebody is by the sound of their footsteps. I appreciate how i can switch from wireless to wired if needed.My only problem is that the velcro is not real long enough to secure properly. The frame is one size only and the elastic strap is not easily maneuverable when it hooks to the elastic instead of velcro. With the strap on vecro though the headset pushes my ears down and if properly centering my ears the cups gap from jawline line; not creating a noise cancelling evironment. I hve to let them sit right at the top of my ear which still causes me to readjust more often than i want to.It could be a 2 star overall just for that but since I'm judging all amenities of the headset, then 4 stars it is.",
          "IM SO MAD. I'VE WASTED SO MUCH MONEY . So I've had these headsets for about 1 month and I'm SO UPSET IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO FIND THESE.  I wish I bought them sooner. I would of saved money because I wouldn't of bought all the other headphones in search for that perfect audio quality.I'm a HUGE fan of PS5 and I've been having a hard time finding a decent pair of headphones that would give me that good directional sound effect that ive been seqrching so long for.  I mostly play Dayz, but I also play Fortnite, Call of duty, Rocket League, and other fps games. Some brands claim that they are \"3D\", \"7k\",\"hi-def\", or even \"Hi-Fi\", but NONE of those headphones can even come close to comparing to the amazing sound these headphones have when using them on PS5. The noise canceling and other features are AMAZING. Sonys Pulse 3D headphones are JUNK, even after adjusting the settings within the PS5 audio software. I've also tried many different brands such as Astro's, Turtle beech, xcloud, and Razer. Trust me when I say NONE of those are better than these SteelSeries 7P+. They might be cheaper, but if your looking for quality over price, these are the right choice. Plus, When I decide to make the switch to PC gaming, I'll still be able to use these headphones.I also purchased the warranty protection plan, because when (or if) these decide to fail, I WILL be getting another pair. I'll be sticking with these headphones throughout the rest of my gaming days unless they decide to sell a better pair within the same price point.Thank you so much SteelSeries for building such a quality set of Headphones. Your a God",
          "I was fairly disappointed with these after upgrading from a cheap $30 headset. I expected a world of difference since it was quadruple the price, but when initially using it on my PS5, it almost sounded like everything was underwater.If you want to use this for console you MUST plug it in to a computer and download the SteelSeries GG software that allows you to tweak and save settings for use on console. Once I did that, it was a world of difference. The sound is great and works very well with the Playstation 3D audio.My biggest complaint at this point is the size. I'm a little taller than average and have a taller head profile. The size is not as universal as the ski-band style adjustment would have you believe. In order to get the cups over my ears I have to press these all the way down until my head is touching the top metal bar - any use of the stretchy band has the ear cups sliding upwards. The ear cups themselves are quite comfortable with a fair amount of breathability.",
          "So far I love these. They blow my old turtle beach headphones out of the water when it comes to sound, comfort, and build quality. The strap that adjusts the size and sits on your head is so simple, practical, and comfortable it's a wonder why more headphones don't feature similar design. The mic slips nicely into the headphone if you're just using them to listen, and there's a handy red light on the end to remind you if it's on mute or not.My only gripe is that they don't connect via Bluetooth, but that's also on playstation for now allowing Bluetooth audio connectivity (obviously for proprietary reasons.) Instead it connects with a physical doggie that plugs into a USB C And allows for a wireless connection. My only worry is that I'll lose it.I used to play games with my headset on, with phone audio playing as well, and now I can't. Outside of that I would give it 5 stars.",
          "I highly recommend these headphones.The sound quality is very good (to me, but I\u2019m not an audiophile).They are comfortable for long periods of use.  I wear them for 4-8 hours, mostly for gaming.I have a large head with big hair and am still able to get them to fit comfortably.  (They have an adjustable stretchy strap for fit)The bluetooth connection is very good (for me it seems to only connect if used with it\u2019s included dongle that attaches to your audio source, but I may not have figured it out yet).  Reception starts to break up when I get 30 feet away with two walls in between.A 3.5mm wired plug adapter is included for situations where the wireless won\u2019t work.  I use this when waiting in the lobby for my car repairs.The mic is boom based for good background noise reduction.  It can be retracted into the headset when not in use.  It has a red led on the tip to indicate when your headset has been muted (I really like this feature!)The volume control knob sticks out a bit and turns easily.  I find this slightly annoying because I tend to bump it and accidentally change the volume.Last but not least, I bought the white/blue version, and they just plain look cool!",
          "Mostly good but it gets very annoying when you turn on the pc or it resets for an update, it seems to throw the headset into a bind and you have to turn it on and off multiple times for it to finally reconnect.",
          "These are very comfortable to wear, very simple to operate, and have an amazing battery life.  Sound quality is not bad, (especially since they use a bluetooth connection) but I wouldn't call the sound quality great.",
          "Overall build is pretty good, definitely feels sturdy. The material band gives it good breathability and the cushioning is very comfy, though they compress allot and as a consequence the rims of my ears touch the inside of the headphones.Sound quality is ok I guess, though when charging there's a buzz and the volume wheel has static when turned all the way up and doesn't remove all the audio when turned down. This might be a defect, idk, could've done with a mute button though.The dongle doesn't play the best with my Laptop, it's caused problems when disconnected and it's shape makes it hard to use for anything outside of Phones and Tablets.Having the mic illuminated when muting feels like a dumb decision. and it's a pain to manually reset.It works nice on PS5, haven't done much testing but the quality sounds better and using the 3D audio was a cool experience.An ok set of headphones, might have been a tad overpriced. Lets just say I've bought better for much less.",
          "Excelente.",
          "By far the best set of headphones one can ask for when gaming. The set is Bluetooth compatible which syncs up easy once installed. The fit of the headset is perfect I love the additional strap, not too tight or loose. The noise cancellation is a 10/10. Audio quality is fantastic and there is an extendable mic that kind of detects speech if someone is speaking to me in the room while wearing the set alone, it plays their speech through the overhead headphones. Overall I\u2019d definitely recommend this product.",
          "Excelent audio. I'm using with PS5",
          "IMO; most comfortable headphones without exposure in the back ear. Best thing is the wireless capability, using a USB-C antenna, works well for on the go audio up to 60+ ft. Highly recommend for audio quality, I find there isn\u2019t enough bass while using the item. Only way to customize the EQ and the built in microphone is their GG Software, which I would rather take the microphone off but it\u2019s a good back up in case your studio or usb microphone goes down or if you\u2019re away from your setup.",
          "I needed a wireless headset and I'm completely happy with how much I spent.I can't speak much to how they perform outside of gaming but they've been great for games.Pros:ComfyAbility to monitor the mic (so you can hear yourself, I use it to hear background noise if someone is talking to me so I don't have to take them off)The mic is decent probably a bit better than average. I can't speak to that too much because I have a high end condenser mic.USB C chargingBattery life is great. I game with them in 2 - 3 hour spurts and I charge them maybe once a week?I'm pretty sensitive to audio delay and I've noticed none at all while using this headset.Cons:A little bulky but that's expected in a headset like thisBetter than using earbudsData is handled by micro USB and not the type C connector. I lost the micro B cable and don't have spares. Data and power should be handled by the same port.The software is a bit clunky but you don't have to use it.Overall: If you need a good wireless headset that won't break the bank and actually sounds good then get this. It syncs up almost as soon as it's powered on. The battery life is something like 20 - 30 hours? Charges in a respectable 3 or so hours.",
          "Love Steel series. I've had a lot of different headsets but this is my second pair of SS and they're always so nice comfy and reliable.",
          "I chose this headset for my PS5, based on my experience with a previous model and my PC. The gaming features (mic, chat, volume control, spatial sound etc.) are just great.The comfort is OK. The headset feels a tad heavy, and can hurt my left ear/jaw after 2-3h+ of gamin. The ear pads are comfortable for short durations.The thing that bothered me was the partial integration with PS5. The headset supports the PS5 3D sound, that is nice. The issue is that you have to switch the sound output on the PS5 if you leave the USB adapted plugged in, whether the headset is on or off. I wanted to have automatic switching: turn on the headset -> PS5 switches to headset; turn off the headset -> PS5 switches to HDMI sound output. This doesn't work like this with this headphone. After you turn on the headset, you have to use your controller to go to sound settings, switch the sound output. Same thing after you have turned off the headset, you have to go to settings, and switch back to HDMI.Maybe not a huge deal for most users, but this combined with no significant improvement in comfort compared with older models, was too much lacking.",
          "Honestly I expected more,  I probably shouldn't have given the price. But with all the amazing reviews i really thought I was going to get that 500 dollar quality for 150.  But this 3 star review isn't based on my unrealistic expectations, it's based on what you get for the price. These really are just average in about every single way.  I have a pair of Chinese generic 25 dollar headphones that sound just as good, maybe even slightly better.Probabably the most annoying feature od this headphones is the large brigt red led on the microphone that comes on when you mute it. Even if you fully retract the mic into the left ear cup, your peripheral vision will still pick up the unessarilly large a bright red led,  It's really distracting and annoying.The sound canceling is okay for the price,  but don't expect true noise canceling , it's more like moderate noise dampening.I do like the controls on the ear pieces, they are pretty well placed and easy to use,  the headset itself is really comfortable , and they have good battery life and range.Once you connect the reciever to your Ps5, They connect to the Ps5 effortlessly.  However if you want to go between headset and external speakers,  you have to change to external sound from the main menu of your ps5 everytime you turn it on,  because as long as the headphones receiver is connected to the ps5 it will always default to the headset when powered on.My advice,  go Budget brand or go Big dollar.  These in between headsets just aren't impressive or offer enough improvements over a budget pair to justify the cost.",
          "I bought these for my wife to replace our old PS platinum headphones on her ps5. These sound fantastic and fit very well with the adjustable strap. At first I thought the strap seemed cheap, but I like it's simplicity and comfort. The retractable mic is nice and has clear audio from it. The volume dials are great for quick adjustments. It's a lot better than tapping a button furiously if the game gets loud for a moment. Also the extra dial for hearing people in the room with you is very convenient instead of trying to get one cup off your ear to hear them. My wife and I absolutely love them. I know they'll be obsolete soon, but for the price, they're perfect.",
          "I ordered your Steel Series 7P+ for my PS5 and I noticed a few problems with the headset and wanted to leave feedback on the product. The USB Dongle is T shaped so when its plugged into the front of a PS5 the dongle blocks the USB port (The port used for a PS5 controller or keyboard) and makes it unusable. Because of this you need to use the USB-C to USB adapter thats included and it has to be hooked into the back of the PS5. Due to the adapter being a cable the dongle and extra wire has to either lay on the ground or flop around on my desk. Now that we have it hooked up to the PS5 next comes the problem of charging the headset. Because the front port is being used for my controller, and the rear port is being used for the dongle (that doesnt fit the front USB-C), you have no other ports on a PS5. I had to run a phone charger from the wall to the USB charging cable and have to charge my headset from the wall instead of from my console. ALL of these issues would be easily resolved if the dongle WASNT shaped like a T and was shaped like a jump drive. Final flaw with the headset is when you pull the mic out or put it away the mic should automatically mute or unmute for use as EVERY other headset does this. Because of this problem when I put the mic into the off position it is still recording my voice and and since caused for some funny moments where my teammates hear things they shouldnt. All of these are flaws with the 7P+ on Playstation 5 and if these issues were resolved the headset would live up to the hype.",
          "Immediately noticed a difference between this and my previous headset. I game off of a PS5 and this is excellent for the platform. Playing MW2 (As an example of a popular game) I'm able to hear enemies long before I see them. Audio is accurate and the volume adjustment is excellent for different games. The mic audio (As noted by my friends) is sometimes robotic sounding. This may be the new MW having issues (it has a lot..) as this is the only game I've played with friends utilizing this headset. I will update the review later to give an idea if it's a product defect or a game issue.Overall I recommend this headset. It's crisp, comfortable for long gaming periods, and easy to set up and use. When muted there's a distinct led on the mic letting you know you're muted (We've all been there during a game when you're giving call outs and you think no one's listening to you... When actually you just messed up and muted yourself) Headset has a good battery life.At this time I don't have any real cons. Maybe price at the worse? Regardless I think this headset is worth the money.",
          "The SteelSeries brand have been known to make quality headsets for us gamers, sound designers, music artists. This Arctis 7p+ I use for all my gaming needs such all the sounds that these can pick up from orbital sounds that make you feel like your in the setting of the game creator to the amount of distance you can hear that sound. That is just the sound aspect let's get to the mic. Whilst this isn't full wireless like bluetooth this allows the person to have near crystal clear mic quality to people the person talks to. It even comes with an awareness type of feature that allows you as the user hear what's going on around you in real time. Overall this headset is quality for a low cost and that is a good motto that SteelSeries makes actually happen.",
          "Like the headline says, it's an excellent headset. I spent a long time researching gaming headsets(since black Friday when I bought the Corsair Virtuoso wireless RGB XT and thought it was the best at everything EXCEPT audio and bass quality Which I ended up returning) The Arctis 7P+ is very close in terms of being compatible with everything and is probably even more comfortable but the most important thing to me was audio quality. The bass is fantastic here, enjoyable , has some punch but doesn't sound muddy. You can use the EQ on the SteelSeries GG software to change how it sounds, like using the increased bass preset, which sounds nice at first but isn't needed imo. The out of the box sound is great with depth and boom when there are explosions and I spend hours talking to my girl on Discord. The microphone is good. The style looks great , I really like it I could have bought the black one and received it much sooner but I opted to wait a few weeks to get this white one which is beautiful (could be better with some RGB though).I would have preferred a gamechat mix wheel instead of the Sidetone control but it's not that important to me. I haven't tried the 3d audio much, I tried it on my PS5 with Cyberpunk 1.5 patch and thought it sounded decent , I normally play on a real 7.1 surround sound system so I've never been impressed with virtual surround sound in headphones. I've been meaning to try Miles Morales but haven't gotten around to it. I spend most days on my gaming PC's and even though the 7+ model is recommended for the PC, this 7P+ works just as well. Whatever they're doing with this sky goggle headband thing works. It's more comfortable than any other headset I tried. I love the headset and would highly recommend it , just keep in mind I've only play Halo infinite and heard footsteps and grenades much better than my previous headsets but I don't play counter strike or Valorant or Overwatch (anymore) so I can't comment on competitive gaming performance but for talking, COOP games and single player and music it's an excellent choice in 2022.",
          "I love this headset.  It is very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is good.  The noise cancelling is good too, but maybe not up to Bose quality.  My only wish is that these were bluetooth so I could use them with my phone as well as the PC.  No stars off for that since I bought them knowing full well they were not bluetooth.",
          "My son is 13. My loves to game, and he\u2019s a bit rough with his stuff. He would literally break everything in possession just by performing his daily activities if so didn\u2019t intervene. We all have our flaws, his just tends to be expensive. Anyway, this one might save me some money over time.My son picked this one out after reading a bunch of reviews, so maybe there\u2019s that piece to it. In the past it was always the Turtle Bay, or whatever those are called, that we bought - but they just kept breaking. My son likes the sound, there have been no issues with the audio, and he has not broken this one AT ALL yet. This seems to be a reasonably priced gaming headset, that is appealing to it\u2019s user, and it appears this one may stand the test of time. If it makes it 6 months, I\u2019ll be thrilled!",
          "-No Bluetooth-The USB C dongle for wireless communication is extremely wide so it blocks the other USB-C port on my laptop. They give you an extension cable for that, but I don't know why they didn't change the orientation of the PCB so it would only take up one slot without the cable.-No way to turn off mic passthrough in the software. Can only do it using the physical knob on the headset.Other than these complaints the headset is rock solid and a fantastic headset for the price.",
          "This product is very good for general gaming and listening to music but it gets better when you are playing campaign because you can dive into the game and feel that you are in it , the only thing I don\u2019t like is te quality of the microphone is not the best but overall the product is very much worth the money",
          "For gaming, noise cancellation, and sound quality, it\u2019s excellent. Great price for an excellent device.",
          "I like this headset. The sound quality is great, exactly what you'd expect out of a high-end gamer headset. The volume controls the physical output level of the headset itself, it's not a soft control for the volume levels on your device, which I personally like. It's also the most comfortable headset I've worn, while also managing to fit tightly on my head. You can move around, do light exercise, lie down, etc. and it will stay snug. No complaints on the battery life. The mic quality is whatever, but that's to be expected.However I write this review to explain an issue which, although not at all a big deal, is frankly inexcusable in current year. 1 month after getting the headset, on a morning right before a meeting, I found out that the headset wouldn't turn on. Normally you hold the power button for a few seconds and it turns on, but this time it just wouldn't. I tried charging it for a while, no luck. Naturally I thought the thing was defective so I contacted customer support to return it. After the usual, they suggested that I try resetting the power on the headest. Huh? Not turning it off and on again (which I obviously couldn't do), but resetting the power. I remember that was a thing you did with like, old electronics. I looked up how to do it online, removed an ear cover (which is easy to do and replace, unlike on some other headsets, so that's a plus), and inserted a paper clip into the reset hole, and boom it worked again.It's nice that this mechanism was in place. It's nice that it was easy. But for an electronic made after 2010, this shouldn't have happened. How often do people have paper clips laying around nowadays? And I checked, I was using the latest firmware.So in summary, great headset, just remember that we're still not in the future yet."

          "Comfortable with great sound. I will not ever buy a different headphone.",
          "I make purchases based on necessity and ROI, after I received my package I was so exited. It was perfect fit my head better than I thought. When I when to play call of duty modern warfare 2 it sounded so great. I realized it better than most because the mic is compact and not all in your face like most microphones. Overall 10/10",
          "Bro, why 0 information on setup, features, etc.I'm big annoyed at it.\ud83e\udd72Good headset tho",
          "Owned a red pair of these for 5 years. Was time for a new set so I bought these again. If it\u2019s not broke don\u2019t fix it! Can\u2019t beat $35 either. I paid $100 for my first pair I bought. I play FPS and RPG games, these won\u2019t let you down either way.",
          "I wouldn't pay full price for this headset just because the quality of the sound could be better, but it's honestly not bad. It's just if you're very picky about sound quality then you're probably going to be slightly disappointed by this headset. I will say though that it's pretty decent because it's super comfortable and light, and I like the retractable mic feature. I heard that my voice through the mic sounds really clear and decent, so that's a plus as well.",
          "Never dabbled into steelSeries product's, but decided to give these a try. I initially bought these with the intent as a back-up headset if my astros were to eventually die out. Plugged the steelseries headset in and my lord these things are LOUD. essentially blasted out my eardrums and made an ear doctor appointment without hesitation because i am now deaf. Extremely comfortable for my huge cranium, and it seems they expand the longer you wear them for extra comfort. 10/10 would recommend!",
          "I have been using these headphones for up to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for work and they are very comfortable and sound great. The ear cushions are large and fully enclosed my ears, the strap above is adjustable and stretchy so it doesn\u2019t leave a dent in my hair and my favorite part is that the microphone is tucked away inside the left earpiece so it is never in the way and they look like regular headphones. For a pair of headphones to rarely chat in but mainly work and game, these are amazing and are a steal if they go on sale!",
          "These are comfortable to wear, I like the fabric band as it does not press on my head and give me pain after wearing it for long periods of time. However it is not noise canceling, which isn\u2019t what I bought it for anyway. I like the retractable mic, it does its job. I don\u2019t stream so I cannot speak to the quality of the mic; but people can hear me with no complaints.",
          "I love this headphones as they are not very flamboyant, white ones look sooo clean, audio is decent, they are comfortable and even they are made of plastic doesn't feel to cheap. A con i found is the removable cable is not usb c, not even micro usb.",
          "Very comfortable headset and sound quality is great. Def worth the purchase. As what the box says, \u201cFor glory!\u201d",
          "Been trying out many gaming headsets, including the SteelSeries Siberia and all had been hurting my ears because the ear well just isn't quite deep enough.  Finally the Arctis 3 doesn't press against my ears and I can wear it all day.One minor complaint is that the headband is much tougher than the Siberia so it tends to squeeze my head a little.  Loosening the velcro band did help but not to the degree I wanted.  Still, it's not enough to deter me away from using it.",
          "But we\u2019re having inconsistent issues with the voice chat. It seems to not function at times with all functionalities enabled. Other then that, it could be some game issue as we\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s worked for almost everything else he\u2019s used it for. The real problems begin with MWII.",
          "Hesitation is defeat!",
          "sounds great, good mic and looks neat. Feels great thanks to the headband. Although when I purchased it i thought the mic would be muted if it was tucked inside the headset but thats not the case. You still have to turn it off but its not really that big of a deal. 8.5/10.",
          "To me, this headset does the job very well, it\u2019s covers my entire ear, and it even fits on my vr system. If your like me and stuck on a razor or Logitech headset, I\u2019d definitely make the switch, 10/10 for the price.",
          "I actually have bought these three times when they go on sale. EXTREMELY comfortable. Well sewn soft ear padding, not vinyl or rubber like some others. These are a soft mesh fabric and are adjustable. I have a giant head and they fit great. Excellent sound and durability.",
          "Its a great headset just it picks up alot of background noises",
          "Using 5 months+ nice quality for ears + sound quality is good . Overall good",
          "The shipping was a little slow but that could've been due to backed up order cause of the holidays. Comfort is very good, fits well even on my big ears. Mic quality isn't anything crazy but it is very solid. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't wanna spend very much money on a good pair of headphones. The only real drawback is the sound quality, it doesn't get as loud as I would like it too and there's not much bass, otherwise very nice. Solid 8/10",
          "\"Hail and well met, kind sir or madam! I hope this missive finds thee in the bloom of health, surrounded by a mirthful aura and a heart full of hope. Permit me to express my heartfelt gratitude for the opportunity to pen this review, a task that I embrace with utmost zeal and verve.Behold, the headphones, a marvel of modern engineering and a true testament to the art of audio! From the moment I cast mine eyes upon these wondrous devices, I was smitten by their peerless quality and the grandiose attention to detail that hath been lavished upon their creation. The sleek and comely design, so pleasing to the eye, didst immediately catch mine fancy, and with bated breath, I didst tear open the packaging to behold these magnificent instruments.And as I didst don them, I was transported to a world of auditory bliss, where the sound quality was naught but phenomenal, providing a truly immersive and transformative experience. The dynamic range, so vast and varied, didst leave me speechless, with highs as crisp as the morning dew and bass so rich and potent as to bring the music to life in a manner that is beyond compare. The soundstage, so spacious and airy, didst leave me in awe, while the instrument separation, so clear and distinct, didst leave me breathless.The noise cancelling feature, a true blessing, didst effectively block out all external noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the audio experience, free from distractions or interruptions. The cushioned ear cups, so soft and gentle on the skin, didst provide a snug and secure fit, ensuring that the headphones didst remain comfortably in place, even during extended listening sessions. The adjustable headband, a marvel in its own right, didst provide a customized fit that was tailored to mine own visage, ensuring maximum comfort and enjoyment.The build quality, a masterpiece of engineering, was a testament to the exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail that hath been poured into these headphones. The materials used, of the highest quality, didst ensure that the construction was solid, durable, and built to withstand the rigors of daily use. The attention to detail, so evident in every aspect of these headphones, from the precise stitching on the cushions to the smooth and seamless operation of the controls, didst leave me in awe.In conclusion, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed by these headphones and would wholeheartedly recommend them to any who seek an exceptional audio experience. The combination of sound quality, comfort, and build quality, so rare and precious, make them a true investment and a joy to use. I do hope that this verbose and effusive review hath been informative and useful, and I thank thee for taking the time to peruse it.",
          "Caught these on a sale and I'm glad I did, this Arctis 3 is not worth the full price.  They'll work for a secondary backup pair but I'll keep looking for something else.Where do I start, let's go with the bad. It comes with a 3 foot audio cable which is useless for PC and console alike.  Maybe if I still had a Sony Walkman cassette player we would be ok.  Next, the audio sound is just ok.  The mids are very muddy, but the highs and lows come out fine.  Last on the bad, this part is YMMV but it's quite snug on the head with a strong clamp force.On to the good, it does have them.  The headset build qualty is great and materials on the ears and top side of the head are comfortable.  Aside from the clamp, they fit nicely.  Next, the roll up mic works fine and I can hear my mouth open every time I go to speak. It's sensitive. Lastly, the audio cable does detach and I suppose could be replaced.  It is proprietary and you'll have to likely get it direct. But, that is a great option and I've had to trash a few good headsets in the past due to cable issues.  3/5 , It's just an ok headset.",
          "(Xbox user) I went thru 3 different brand headphones and it was either durability or the mic that was a issue. I was extremely skeptical on what to get next and kept going back and forth trying to decide. Finally I just said F it bought the Arctis 3 console edition .Pros--Very lite and and ear pads are very soft feels great for long gaming sessions and wearing glasses with.- placement of buttons are very convenient- love the hanging band idea making it feel like the headset isn\u2019t even on and no memory foam to worry about coming out from bad stitching or glue like my last pair on the headband part.- so far strong wire connection into headset , doesn\u2019t just pull out easy if I accidentally snag it or pull on it.- mic is awesome and friends can hear me great and it\u2019s not picking up gaming noise from the headphones when I\u2019m not talking which was a big issue picking up sounds from my headphones to the mic when i wasn\u2019t speaking with my other brands.Cons- they aren\u2019t very snug so sometimes they move very little while playing but that can be a pro for some folks giving not everyone likes the snug fit.- wish it had noise cancellation. It deft cuts out a lot of noise but if complete noise canceling is what u want these will let some sound in . Not a lot but some and it\u2019s noticeable compared to true noise cancellation.- could be a tad bit louder. It sounds great and I can hear everything in the game very well but I feel they can just be alittle louder compared to my last set of headsets.All in all definitely a 5 star for me !! Great sounding and very comfortable . The cons for me even tho they are downsides they are very minuscule and don\u2019t take away from any gaming session at all . If your skeptical just go for it with these you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
          "For the price you get a headset that rivals my old astro headset. You hear everything around you clearly and how far away they are. They can connect to anything you have, even a switch. I seriously can't say enough good things about them. Stop reading reviews and purchase already.",
          "Got these for $40, and I was kinda nervous after reading reviews. I saw a few saying they don\u2019t work for xbone so when I tried them on and tested them out and they didn\u2019t work I got freaked out. Turns out I didn\u2019t put the cord in far enough and felt like an idiot lol. They do work for Xbox I think the others that say they don\u2019t are a little challenged. If they\u2019re quiet you can tweak the settings in your party. Be smart and troubleshoot before you say they don\u2019t work because they\u2019re perfectly fine and for the price you can\u2019t go wrong, they\u2019re comfy and sound great!",
          "it gud",
          "After many cheap headphones, I finally decided to invest a little more for quality headphones. Definitely could tell the difference in sound quality and the ear cushion feels great. For the price this is a great buy!",
          "The sound quality outside the box feels great, even a bit of rumble from the ambiance sounds from the PS5 feel nice, but the Microphone is probably where the price tanks so low for these headphones for me.There\u2019s no external sounds there but there is a constant buzz in the microphone that\u2019s very noticeable. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a defect or not.",
          "For me, it\u2019s always been the cables of the headphones that deteriorate before the headphones themselves, hence the appeal of an easily replaceable wire in these bad boys case. But alas, not this time \u2014 this time, the problem lies within, and after only 9 months of extremely light use and good care. Truly a great headset til the end though.",
          "Not disappointed",
          "This headset is the most comfortable one I have ever worn... which I am not sure is saying much as I dont go through many headphones.The cable is a bit short for PC play unless you have some way to extend the cable as I do.",
          "Coming from ASTRO's to these, love these. Deffinetly will buy another pair when needed. Great product for the money! No need to spend $100 when the sound just as good.",
          "The headset is absolutely phenomenal for its price great for fps, story and all types of games even just chatting with friends, the sound quality is amazing and would highly recommend for all casual and or try hard gamers, I had my last pair for the past 5 years and they held up the entire time, unfortunately they would\u2019ve lasted a lot longer but I was dumb and accidentally dipped the mic in my water bottle while taking a swig so the mic was messed up and had a echo so completely my fault not the headsets, so keep in mind when using the mic is very fragile to liquids but other than that an absolutely phenomenal headset 100/10 would recommend.",
          "I have a pair of the Arctic 5 from years ago and they've worked flawlessly for me. I needed a pair for somebody else so I went with these and they haven't disappointed. Solid, fairly light, good mic and drivers, comfortable for hours of use, and the white matches the decor perfectly.",
          "I've owned StealSeries wired headsets for PC since 2018.  My husband uses one too since 2020 for working from home.Our family has owned and used 3 of this console one since 2021.  One used by a 9 year old boy, a second unit used by an 10 year old boy, and the third used by myself when not using the PC at my desk.Before the SteelSeries console headsets my boys would be going through other branded headsets (in the same price range) every 6 months; the other brands mics would break or cords stopped working, you name it it would happen shortly after they started using other brand headsets.We travel with these, we walk around the house with them, we use the SteelSeries headsets most of the day hours at a time.My kids haven't changed their use habits from using other branded headsets to using StealSeries, and yet the StealSeries console headsets have lasted 3-times as long as others!  Hmmm!My kids, or myself, don't have complaints wearing SteelSeries or using the mics.  The sound isn't a worry either.From a whole gaming family to anyone... I whole heartedly recommend this headset!  For us, it's been a great experience.",
          "Worked great until the mic died. It died after a few months",
          "Shipped overnight which was awesome.The audio quality is great, and it\u2019s super comfortable to wear for a couple hours while gaming.Mic is very crisp and clear. No echo, feedback, or static. And the volume controls on the headset are a great featureAlso, you can go to Steelseries\u2019 website and get the USB attachment to use instead as an upgrade.But this headset is great! Especially for that price!",
          "I actually really enjoy this headset, it has a very crisp and clear sound experience, my friends say my mic is very clear. one thing i love is it doesn\u2019t really pick up little background sounds like my dog barking. Great for my little gaming sessions",
          "I bought the SteelSeries Arctis 3 to use with my Quest 2 since they looked comfortable.  I've been using my Sony PS4 Gold Headphones until now and while they sound great, the round earcups were a bit binding.  The SteelSeries 3 are very comfortable and decently made, but they sound awful.  There is no bass or decent stereo separation especially when plugged into the Quest 2.  With a laptop they do sound a bit fuller, but still can't hold a candle to my other headphones.  I was very disappointed with these.  They look great and are very comfy, but the cheap sound really is a dealbreaker.  I can't return them because I had to tear open the darn box when trying to get them out of the package.  Their other models may sound good but I don't recommend this model.",

          "Got these as a gift for the Mr. and def earned cool points! The best features (I've heard) are the mic quality, comfortability, and overall experience/compatibility with controller.",

          "I've purchased several of these over the years, for gifts and personal use. Recently purchased this pair as a backup to another pair that's starting to show age, and realized I bought the wrong ones. The pair I have, has a little dial on my desk, this has a 3.5mm jack, not a USB like I currently have. Whatever, my fault, cord should still work from old->new, same hole design. 5 star headphones, do recommend.",
          "perfect",
          "Nice...",
          "I bought these a couple of months ago to use with my Nintendo Switch & they work with that. But the product page said they would also work with my XBox (Series S). They do not play well with the XBox. Even when the volume is turned all the way to max, my friends can barely hear me. I ended up buying XBox headphones from Microsoft for use with the XBox.  Given that, these are comfortable, and since I wear glasses that is always an issue. the sound is ok, about what is to be expected for the price  point. they seem fairly well made and they do work with the Switch for listening and speaking. They also work with my phone.",
          "I switched to this headset after using a HyperX Cloud Pro for a year which developed an issue with the mic echoing. I've heard great things about SteelSeries, and being that the HyperX one failed me after only a year, I decided to give SteelSeries a go.Here is what I have found so far:Comfort- both headsets I would say are the same levels of comfort. The SteelSeries headset is more difficult to adjust, but comfort is about equal overall.Material Quality- HyperX headset definitely felt like better quality. This SteelSeries one feels more like a budget headset compared to the HyperX. I do like the design of the SteelSeries MUCH better than the HyperX.Sound- I wasn't impressed by the SteelSeries' sound quality, but it wasn't bad. The HyperX headset had really solid sound quality and this Arctis 3 does feel like a small downgrade to me.Mic- Both are equal here. The real test will be if this SteelSeries headset makes it longer than the HyperX did before the mic fails.Overall, for $70 I would probably look elsewhere for a headset. I got this one on Prime Day, so I would say for the $49 I paid, it is not bad at all! I may decide to try a higher end SteelSeries in the Arctis lineup as the reviews have been great, but the Arctis 3 is not impressing me like I thought it would. I may have had my expectations just too high here, but even compared to my old HyperX Cloud Pro, it does not feel or sound like a $70 headset at all.",
          "I bought these at a discount and they are decent headphones but they are a little quiet and when I use full volume they have a static noise."

          "Update 6 months after purchase-Had them on the charger for a few hours, unplugged for a gaming session. About an hour in they turned off automatically, and won't turn back on. Nothing happens when the charger is plugged in even for a period of time. They are now completely worthless. Don't waste your money on this expensive paper weight. Buy a corded set and be done with lackluster wireless performance from \"top brands.\"I bought two sets of these because they were touted as one of the best wireless headsets for Xbox one, one for myself and one for my girlfriend. Figured would be a nice Christmas gift. They sound great, have cool features like built in equalizer presets and the mic mute indicator (very handy for reminding you of being muted so you don't wonder why your friends aren't answering you). We're both pretty happy with overall performance vs cost with some exceptions. My headset was functionally perfect out of the box, while my girlfriends seems to have had an issue with the volume roller (right ear cup) causing static in the speakers, and she has to mess with it to get a clear sound almost every time she puts them on. Needless to say, she's not super impressed with build quality, and I'm even less so because of this. It's really, really, really not hard to make a quality, fault-free rheostat resistor, it just costs a little more than a dollar. We're also both having some very annoying connectivity issues with our Xboxes. I have a 2015 Fallout 4 bundle model and she has the newer One S purchased April 2019, both 1G units. Long story short I had a blowout in my back so I've been laying on the floor less than 6 feet from my Xbox with nothing between me and it. Even being this close I have pretty consistent blips of loss of sound and a smidge of static presumably from some sort of interference, and she has reported the same being slightly farther away from hers. While we're on the topic of distance, these units have an absolutely Terrible range for being \"bluetooth\" wireless (I use the quotations because Xbox uses a proprietary wireless communications protocol that isn't exactly bluetooth simply because not all bluetooth devices can connect to it, and they presumably did this to either be different than PlayStation or for security concerns). Either headset we have drops connection when we walk into the kitchen. Granted line of sight is obstructed, it's less than 20 feet away from our Xboxes. We also both have moments where the headset loses connection with the Xbox, often causing need for a reboot of the headset in order to reconnect regardless of distance/line of sight with the Xboxes. Extremely annoying mid-raid in Destiny 2.. or any time really. I've also experienced numerous times where I turn them on, they connect and I get sound for maybe 5 seconds and then nothing, so I go to reboot and after holding the power button to turn them off, they make the sound indicator for turning on, after having already been turned on, and then they connect and it's fine. Its worth noting that we both experience all these issues while playing independently or at the same time. It doesn't seem to matter. After having done some research into our connectivity issues regarding interference with/from other devices such as routers, wireless surround sound units, etc, the only other wireless devices we have on while playing are our phones, usually a few feet away from the headsets while worn, and of course the router is on. I've long ago disabled the 2G band on our router because we don't use it, which disabling one or the other band is a suggested solution. But, we live in an apartment and we have a number of other routers in range of my phone so perhaps we're getting external interference, I'm not 100% sure yet, but in the case that we are, I think engineering/communications protocols require improving to alleviate this seemingly widespread issue. I'm not super impressed with these because of all this, and for the price I could have gotten a couple much nicer wired sets that would be much more reliable and give me that boomier bass that these are a little lackluster on. As I write this review my headset is cutting out and losing/regaining connection, and again I'm on the floor less than 6 feet away, which in my annoyance has prompted me to write this review.One last gripe about this headset, as confirmed by myself, my girlfriend, and a gamer friend in the UK who also bought these, you have to remember to turn the headset off before turning off the Xbox, otherwise with the headset still powered on, the Xbox will turn itself on after being turned off as if you just turned a controller on, and this will happen repeatedly until the headset is turned off or drops connection.Everything noted here clearly explains the 3 star review, which can be improved upon greatly.Update 4 months after purchase;I've reduced my rating to a one star simply because I've lost too many competitive matches because of difficulty in communication with teammates due to my headset audio cutting out, staticy mic output, or dropping connection/randomly turning off by itself. This is completely unacceptable performance for such a price and makes me less inclined to purchase another set of supposedly top rated wireless headphones period, regardless of brand.",
          "These headphones could be awesome, but they missed the mark badly on basic functionality. My biggest problem with these I have is connecting to group chat and I can hear everyone, but no one can hear me. This happens the majority of the time, and I usually have to disconnect headphones and reconnect them and hope it works. Its rather embarrassing when your friend all have the cheapie headphones and they connect with ease and can hear each other fine. The next biggest problem is charging. For some reason they can be connected to xbox all night with xbox on, but when I goto use them they don't turn on. I have to plug them in and they I can turn them on. Sometimes I can disconnect the cord once I get them to turn on, but sometimes they appear to not be holding the charge. So at that point I end up using them with a cord connected for power. One of the major selling points was I wanted to have WIRELESS ( including power) headphones.Now with the bad things out the way, what I like about them. They sound really, really good. I hear sounds in games I never heard before, everyone hears me clearly ( when I do get them connected properly) and I can hear everyone. I like the controls to be able to lower game sounds and voices separately directly on the headset. My next big thing that I like about them, is they are comfortable. Usually, after a few hours full size headphones get heavy on my ears . Being female, with a smaller head and ears, this can get quite uncomfortable. These headphones I can wear for hours on long gaming sessions and no discomfort.  They also have a nice range I literally can walk around the house from one room to another and be in group chat and not break up. Nice when you need to run to kitchen and don't want to have to remove headset, and my kitchen is not close to my bedroom.Should you buy them? Hmm, if you don't use group chat as much as I do, you may not be as bothered by the issues with connecting to chat, but then you may still experience the power on issue. For this price point, it's hard to recommend headsets that have issues like this on a regular with basic functionality. I really hope they get a software upgrade at some point to fix these issues. When they work, they are the best gaming headphones for chat and gaming as far as how they sound that I've ever had. Being wireless is a huge plus ( when it works properly), most wireless suffer in sound quality, but these don't. Those are thing things that have kept me from sending them back. However, if I had to buy another set of upper end headphones I would probably try and another brand.",
          "Here is a honest review of this product and why you should avoid (or purchase)THE BADPoor/NO support support from Steelseries - This is why I wont purchase from the manufacturer again (You descide)Poor loudness (volume)Hardware is a little outdated (Build in 2019 so as of 2022 this is 3 years old out of the box)THE GOODComfortableGreat quality buildSound Quality is AWESOME (if you can hear it)Good battery lifeEarpiece is a little insulating and ears get hot of prolonged gamingPurchased the unit and out of the box the volume was slightly too loo on full volume. I followed the troubleshooting steps to update firmware and reset the headset to no avail.Next searched online (Google) and it appears as though I am not the only one with issue (Many Results found from others having the same issue).Here where the \"Support\" issue starts. There is NO WAY to chat or call support (For a high end unit that is not cheap this is very odd). I had to email tech support then wait (2) days to get an email with the following content:\"Thanks for the feedback! I'll be forwarding this feature request to our software team! :)\" - Case closedThey did not even try to resolve the issue.Next I went to Twitter @SteelSeries and posted my experience.Someone reached out to me and asked for the ticket # so they can investigate this for me.2 days later NO response. I replied to the tweet asking for an update and am still waiting for a response.Due to these issues I'm going to return the unit as I don't want to get stuck with it and can't fix it with the help of support.This product hardware / controls is Manufactured in 2019 so from the get go it's a little dated and not super intuitive.Let me explain the hardware and controls being out of date:First of all the wireless is using a dedicated 2.4 Ghz controller (Most newer headset use 5Ghz). This causes the range to be dismal, I'm talking 20-25 feet. Once you are out of range you will need to turn off the unit then turn it back on to get reconnected. Sounds simple enough but the controls are not well thought out for this task. Because the power button is not just for power you will need to press and hold for (3) seconds (any longer (6) seconds and you active the reconnect to XBox function or bluetooth), the hold it again for (3) seconds to turn it back on. This mean we you walk some 25 feet away you are stuck for around 20 seconds pushing buttons to get the headset reconnected (Not good mid-game).It is power via Micro USB (Has to plugin one way not either way like USB-C) which is a pain because it's connector is Black on the Black ear piece. Very hard to see especially in low light. Frequently I spend 2-3 minutes trying to get it plugged in to charge after a late night of gaming.Final Thoughts:If Steelseries had better support (or any support for that matter) (I'm 3-4 days in waiting for an answer) purchasing this Headset would be a NO BRAINER as the sound quality / build quality/ / Battery Life is as good if not better than many other units $100+ the price of this unit. However due to the lack of support (and trust me you don't need support until you do) is a DEAL BREAKER for me. I'm sad to say I'm going to return this unit and stay away from Steelseries products going forward. This does make me sad I had such high hopes for the Arctis 9X and all the reviews I read on many sites have this unit at the top of the reviews.Hope this review help you make the right choice for you and if you purchase one of these you are making a well informed descision.",
          "Received in May 2021what I consider being my first gaming headset. Since then I've gone back and forth from enjoying it to feeling like I wasted two hundred on an auditory illusion that at times is outperformed by a sixty-dollar Astro headset that I don't even consider to be for gaming. It definitely brought familiar areas in games to life in a way I never experienced before which is great but virtual surround sound is virtually useless without visual cues and map memorization. You can gain a competitive edge  it's just not as straightforward or effective as surround sound. Of course, that's with every headset. That aside, these sound great when gaming out of the box and can be adjusted using a PC. They're not loud and lack base but you can hear every little sound clearly. The design is light and comfortable to use. I'm surprised they dropped the ball using a micro USB port and a volume dial that goes from 0 to max from the slightest touch. I didn't think the port was that big of a deal when reading other reviews but it doesn't connect easily and if it breaks then it's game over and goodbye to my $200. The broken volume dial renders the headphone jack unusable. It feels like a cheap set you wouldn't spend $10 on. For the price, you'd think they'd be my go-to headphones for devices like my pricey mind machine but I'd much rather use cheap Astros or earbuds. Again, this is when using the jack.As for the dual-function Bluetooth/wifi, this headset's main selling point, the connection quality is hit or miss and I don't have anything to compare it to. The battery lasts forever. It has never failed me even when I forget to charge it. The dual function is great and if that's what you're looking for, idk of any other headset that has this feature at least at the time I purchased it. If you need it, this is a solid purchase. If you don't care then it's a hard sell and I wouldn't recommend any headset unless you must have one for practical reasons. Otherwise, as far as performance, you're much better off getting an actual surround sound system. I had a cheap Sony that didn't cost much more than these virtual surround headphones. If you live in an apartment, have roommates, kids, or whatever,  I get it. Just don't get caught up in the hype and think you're buying something comparable.I don't regret the purchase and have found many uses for it outside of gaming. If you play Destiny then you will probably understand when I say I hate these Steelseries, they're my favorite headphones.",
          "I owned this headset for 20 months, until it literally fell apart on me.  The major design flaw is how they connect the earpiece to the headband.  It's a very narrow connection and the head band and the earpieces have some heft to them.  Just the other day, I went to adjust my mixer and volume settings and I felt a crack near the dial on the left earpiece.  By the time the play session ended it suffered catastrophic failure and the earpiece was left dangling by a wire and was no longer wearable.  I have some other minor issues as well.  It seemed that the mixer and volume dials would constantly change between the end of one session and the beginning of another session.  I have no idea how that happened, but I always hung it up after a session.  It was a bit of a nuisance to have to keep adjusting it every time I started a session.  The other issue I had was with band not fitting snuggly, which would cause it to slide a lot on my head.  If I leaned forward or backward there was a chance of the entire headset falling off my head.  I had originally ordered this for use with my XBox One X and had no issues with setting it up, but when I went to transfer it to my XBox Series X I had a bit of difficulty linking the two devices.  I also rarely ran into issues with the headset turning itself off shortly after turning it on and needed to be turned on again.Some of the good was it was very comfortable.  I felt it breathed nice and was much cooler than other headsets I had purchased.  The cushion on the earpieces was made of a very nice material and doesn't erode and fall apart like other headsets that may use that pleather-like coating, making it all nasty.  I also liked the retractable mouthpiece and how it lit up on the tip when you had it on mute.I fully expected this headset to last way longer than 20 months and thought it would last at least 5 years.  I really wish I got the service plan, but that's just my luck, I guess.  If it wasn't for it falling apart all of a sudden within a couple years of purchase, I would have given this my strongest recommendation.  Alas, that didn't happen; and I'd only recommend buying this if you plan to get the service plan as well.",
          "This is a good headset, good bluetooth capabilities. The sound quality and the comfortability is the best part of this headset. The headset doesn't even feel like its on your head sometimes. Now.. for the eh parts of the headset. After 3 months of use the headset was showing some signs of wear which was daunting for an item that cost me 200$. A week after noticing the signs of wear the right side earphone muff thing broke off completely. I contacted amazon and they told me to talk to steel series themselves, I did and they were noooo help but, amazon said if they didn't help me that they would. Amazon replaced my headset and made me feel heard. Amazon is a great company and I will always choose Amazon when doing online orders.  The headset they gave me to replace the broken one has been going strong for almost half a year now. Doubt I received a dud as I've seen that this is a recurring issue with other consumers of this product. Overall 4/5 only because Amazon saved the day. IF the headset didn't break the first time this would be a 5/5.",
          "I wanted a major headset upgrade and decided that I wanted to go wireless. I've been surfing multiple websites and this headset has been mentioned frequently as one of the best in Xbox wireless headsets. With me wondering if I made the right choice, I placed my order and was eager waiting for the headset to arrive.My first impression was that the headset is really nice and minimal, with the only contrast being the black-green pattern band. I took the band off as I have an afro and it fits me well.I really liked how they nailed some of the features of this headset, like the game/chat wheel, the red LED for a muted mic, and the bluetooth function. The bluetooth function is what won me over and it's integrated very well! I was rock solid on this headset and felt like I really made the right choice.............that's until I experienced the static and audio drops that this headset is criticized for. I didn't really mind it at first, but all of that changed when I walked out of my room. The headset drops audio almost immediately and if I don't come back in range after a certain period, then it fails to reconnect at all and I have to turn the headset all the way off and then back on. In my case, what use is a wireless headset for if I can't walk out of my room with it?This was a major dealbreaker for me. This was my first time with a SteelSeries product and I was beyond disappointed, and was getting ready to return the headset the next day. In my mind, this headset nailed everything but its core feature and was really sad that I was going to return it.BUT THAT'S UNTIL I decided to swap over from my original Xbox One to the Xbox Series X. I originally bought the xsx for my room but then I gave it to my brother to keep for himself and now waiting for another to ship to me. Before I went with returning the headset, I grabbed the xsx and put it back in my room so if anything improved, it would be in my controlled environment (I also run the Xbox One as mentioned, along with monitors, a desktop computer, and various smart home devices in my small room).I paired the headset with the series X, hopped in a party, and well... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! My friends mentioned that my mic quality was better, and I can walk around and out my room with no connection drops. Hell, I was able to walk around a whole 2 story house with little distortion and no audio drops from my party. Much, much, much better range when connected to the Xbox Series X instead of the Xbox One.I was so happy that I now have a headset that fulfills all my needs and even exceeds in some ways. 2 things I wish this headset had was USB-C and a foam piece for the mic, but that can be bought for cheap. A tip is that if you are going to rock this headset, also buy a \"micro USB magnetic charger\" for convenient snap-on charging.Definitely recommend this headset to current and future Series X|S owners.",
          "The SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless Gaming Headset stands out with its sleek design and stellar audio performance. Its intuitive button layout allows for easy access while wearing the headset. Additionally, its ability to pair with both an Xbox and phone simultaneously is a major convenience factor for gamers. I personally like to listen to music on my phone and still hear the game audio. This headset can do that. The high-quality audio drivers and DTS Headphone:X 2.0 surround sound create an immersive audio experience that lasts up to 20 hours on a single charge, making the Arctis 9X an excellent choice for gamers who value audio performance and convenience.",
          "Bought a pair of the original 7x a while back and returned them almost immediately. They were very comfortable but sounded just ok, felt flimsy, and showed wear very quickly. Tried several other brands, ultimately settling on the Lucid LS50x, and have happily used those for a few years.Bought these after reading the rave reviews about the new Nova Pros and finding them a bit expensive for my use (Xbox only), and man what a difference. The sound quality and directionality are night and day better than the Lucids, which were on par with the original 7x and every other Xbox headset I've tried, and the build quality is fantastic.Extremely comfortable, very solid, compact enough that the cans don't bump the headrest on my gaming chair every time I move, and so light it makes me realize how much neck/head fatigue my old set was causing. Just wouldn't want to walk around with them much since the strap design is more geared towards prolonged comfort than a secure fit.Hands down the best Xbox headset to date.",
          "My chief concerns when ordering a headset was the fit and comfort. I often wear glasses when gaming so that was one concern over the ears, I also have what I\u2019d consider a big head. I\u2019m very happy to report that they fit with room to spare, and are VERY comfortable.Now to the function. Initial setup/connecting to a console were a breeze. It syncs to your console (Series X in my case) just like a controller. I like the controls for volume and mic controls on the headset, you can easily use all of them without needing to look at them. The sound quality feels immersive, I can easily hear sound from multiple directions in FPS games.You can simultaneously sync to your phone while connected to the console. It works very well for listening to music or messing around on your phone if you\u2019re in a loading screen. And yes, you can make phone calls. The person I called said the mic was crisp and clear.Cons - I\u2019m nervous about the long term health of the charging port. I think if you treat it nicely that you should be fine, and the long battery life should minimize needing to use it. It also comes with an Aux port if you want to be wired.In about 20 hours of gameplay, I have had ONE disconnection, and it reconnected after turning it off/on. I also experienced an odd problem where the console was loosing sync with the controller and I could only resync after doing a full system shutdown. This only started after I got the headset so I believe it was connected. I fixed the issue by disabling the instant on feature of the Xbox, which in the case of the Series X hardly makes a difference as it starts within seconds.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased. I cannot understate the comfort enough. At no point have I felt like they\u2019ve become uncomfortable. Build quality feels rock solid. Even with the occasional connectivity quirks, I\u2019d still recommend them.",
          "I've owned the Arctis 9X headset for about 4 months.  Recently, the right speaker started cutting in and out.  Then finally it completely stopped working.  After I bit of troubleshooting, I am fairly certain that the solder connection on the PBC from the master volume knob to the right speaker had failed.I'm not too happy with the return process.  First, I'd like to say that the support person that I emailed back and forth with was very nice and did her job well.  That being said, the actual policy for replacing headsets that fail due to a hardware failure is lackluster.After going through the support process, I was told that they would give me a voucher to purchase I like-for-like replacement from their web store.  Great!  Except, they are currently out of stock on the webs store.This is NOT the most customer centric process.  Thankfully, I still have my Turtle Beach headset, which I love but disconnects more frequently than the Arctis. (See \"CONNECTIVITY\" below).  But if I didn't have the backup headset, I'd be forced to be without a headset until they decide to restock the web store.  Or go buy something to get me by.  I was told they should have them back in stock in 2-3 weeks.  Not cool.As far as the headset itself.SOUND: They sound great.  Clear, crisp and loud enough.  They sound just as good, if not better than the Turtle Beach headsets.MIC: It's not the greatest.  The claim that SteelSeries makes regarding the mic being the same technology as used on aircraft carries is. . . . . accurate?  But I don't think that's something to be boasting about.  I literally sound like an airline pilot making an announcement over the intercom.NOISE CANCELING: As far as noise canceling goes. . . there doesn't seem to be any.  It picks up EVERY room noise.  Every shift or slight movement of the headset.  If I take a drink unmuted, by buddy asks me if I'm ok because he says it sounds like I'm drowning.OVERALL DESIGN: They look good.  I'm not a fan of the retractable mic.  Or having the mute button on the back of the right ear cup.  I miss being able to flip my mic up to mute.  I'm on the fence with the dedicated \"master volume\" and game/chat mix dials.  For one, I'll often accidentally bump the dials when I put the headset on or take it off.  And in my case, it's another point of failure vs. just having the game/chat mix dial.  They are heavier than my Turtle Beach headset, but are still comfortable.  Even after hours long gaming sessions.BATTERY LIFE:  Battery lasts a really long time.  There are some weekend where I might have the headset on for 8+ hours straight and I've never had an issue with running out of juice.CONNECTIVITY: If you're having issues with your current headset dropping connection often, these will not fix your issue.  As mentioned above, the don't drop quite as often or as hard as my Turtle Beach headset, but it still happens.  I'm pretty sure having my wireless router right next to my Xbox, is the source of my problem.Verdict:The failure of the headset after 4 months of use is frustrating.  But stuff happens.  It's inexcusable that they do not have stock on hand to honor warranty returns.  Because of that, I can't recommend.  I need to fix my wireless router interference issue and go back to using the Turtle Beach headsets.",
          "I\u2019ve bought two of these headsets for buddies on Xbox and to no surprise the both of them are also in love with them. Comfy head strap, great style and feeling to the ear cushions. Independent voice chat and content/game audio sliders. The microphone thankfully doesn\u2019t mute or shut off when you plug the headset in to charge mid use. (My friends and I had a different brand headset that would no longer transmit your microphone when it was being charged while using it. It was wireless only, even though it was usb it didn\u2019t want to allow you to use it wired so you were silenced for a little bit if your headset was dying.) Audio quality and direction is fantastic. One note I\u2019d like to point out is make sure you look at what direction the microphone is facing if your friends are having a hard time hearing you. One of the guys moves his arms a lot lol and the mic piece gets flipped and we can barely hear him when that happens. It\u2019s not crazy expensive nor very cheap but this is a true case of, you get what you pay for here. Quality worth every penny on that price tag, and an awesome day when on sale.If you have any problems: You can reach out about your order, it can be replaced by Amazon/Steel Series if necessary!Utilize your warranty! Pay close attention to the manufacture warranty because there are always bad apples for all companies and products. I have not ran into any bad products from Steel Series. But make sure to utilize the warranty if something is wrong with your product. For example if the sound is only coming out of one ear. If google says it\u2019s just a driver issue and the latest update for the headset does the job then awesome. If the \u201cfix\u201d requires you to get physical with the headset and take anything apart you could very easily break it which voids your warranty. I\u2019d much prefer warranty and get a new headset that actually works this time. You paid good money for something important, nice, and not exactly cheap, so you better get what you paid for and that warranty is part of that money, so use it!",
          "I purchased these despite the reported issues with connectivity. And I noticed when I purchased it I had no offer to add a protection plan. This was concerning.I received my headset and charged them, but they appeared fully charged. I then hooked them up to my laptop to adjust the settings and check for firmware updates. Surprisingly, there was no update and I appear to have the same version that has been out with reported issues.Knowing that I didn't want to use the Bluetooth feature and after reading about others experience. I decided to disable the Bluetooth auto connect feature in the steelseries engine.I synched my headset to my Xbox and viola! They certainly sound great. The volume isn't excessive, but that's probably for the best. They sound fantastic and I noticed directional audio was very good.After one match in the new COD MW. I was in the menu when I noticed the first sign of crackling.I grew concerned considering the price tag.But I continued. The crackling would occasionally occur, more commonly with the menu soundtrack.Then in game there were a few instances of the audio momentarily dropping.I was trying anything I could think to determine the cause. I tried turning off Bluetooth devices around me.It was then I notice it happens more when I move abruptly. This made me fear it was a hardware issue such as loose parts.After giving up to find the cause of the issue, I continued playing.At some point the headset disconnected entirely despite still being powered on. I was sure I was going to return them at this point.But I wanted to game. So after reading guidance I found online. I shut off the headset. Hard reset my console. And smoked a cigarette.Since I turned it on after this, I have had no issues. Even if I move my head more than I naturally would.Now this was about 18 hours ago. I'm about to use them again and hope there are no issues.If it's a firmware issue I don't mind waiting for an update. Because if I have no more issues, then the troubles I had in the first few hours after initially connecting no longer occur. Then these deserve 5 stars.I may update my review of anything changes. I bought them with confidence the connectivity issues have had ample time to be addressed and resolved. However I did have the same reported issues initially.If they don't have anymore connection issues, these are hands down 5 stars.This may be the most comfortable headset I have ever worn. And they sound great.For the price, I expect the quality. And if the connection issues persist then the headset is unbearable to use. I hope they last and I don't run into many more issues.I definitely recommend them. The only caveat is the present connection issues that commonly occur. If you get a pair, try what I did and troubleshoot. Because now that they have been working, I'm very happy with them. I'm hoping they continue to work well because it would be sad for such a great product to become useless due to one significant flaw.",
          "These where perfect when working, didn't have any connectivity issues like other people but you kinda want to treat these like wired headsets. Don't try to walk into another room real quick or they will disconnect and not reconnect for a long time unless you turn them on and off.Make sure the headsets have line of sight with the platform your using or it will immediately drop connection but that's minor, you won't be jogging around the house while gaming just would be nice if I could take a leak real quick and comeback without either taking them off first or turning then on and off because they disconnect because I went to the bathroom which is about 7 steps away from my Xbox.So I brought these and they lasted a year and just refused to turn on or charge. I hit up steel series.com and they pretty much said screw off so I will never by another one of there headsets again and that sucks but the steel series a super high quality.",
          "I've had all kinds of headphones for gaming over the years, Astro A40, Turtle Beach, Tritton, Razer, tried them all.  This is my first set of SteelSeries and a am impressed by far with the comfort.  The ear cups are like putting clouds on the side of your head the are so comfortable for wearing for hours at a time.  I though the ski goggle type band at the top was goofy but it's also so comfortable.  The Mic even is nice, depending on your preference you can pull it out a little bit or all the way out to your mouth and the red LED on it when you mute is bright and very obvious.The charging ports on these kinds of things always seem to be a generation behind and this is no different, there's a micro-usb port rather than a USBC type charging port.  But my older Turtles and Astros both use Mini-usb so it's at least a generation newer than those.The 100% cordless is amazing, i've lost a few headset chat cords to my dog that likes to nip at them when I'm gaming of it i take it off for various reasons that's what he grabs the little cord.  The 9X is completely wireless fixing all my doggo issues and it's just nice to have that freedom not having a cord going to the controller for chat.  Another great thing with the game audio being 100% wireless is it should move forward to Series X pretty well which will not have a fiber output jack on it making my older astros and older turtles seemingly useless on the upcoming new consoles.Wireless however has one downside, interference.  You may need to adjust the wifi channels that your router is using so that you get a clear channel for your 9x and then you won't get interference.  I'd already done that for my Astros and Turtles so they worked without interference and my 9x's work just as well zero interference and zero disconnects from xbox one x.The physical buttons are pretty minimal.  Pairing to the xbox the directions are wrong, you need to hold the pairing button in much longer than the manual states, until the LED blinks ONLY white, not blue and white.  At that point it'll pair with xbox.  Straight up wrong documentation on that.  But otherwise the buttons function well it's easy to hit the mute button, and the two volume knobs to adjust main volume and then chat/game mix volume work great.  It can also stream in bluetooth audio as well but i have not had a need to try that out.The battery is rated for 20 hours but I can't confirm or deny that claim, i tend to charge it every other day so it's got 8-10 hours on it before i charge it and that's been working great with zero low battery warnings.Overall, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this headset to anyone .  It's comfortable, it sounds great, lasts a long time and seemingly should have zero issues rolling forward into the next generation.",
          "These headphones are great enough that I'm overlooking the few negatives I have with them to give it a full five stars. I know a lot of people probably care about sound quality the most, and that is how I started my title, but I'm going to go with comfort first. I've worn these headphones upwards of 3 hours straight on a work call and barely even knew they were on my head. The adjustment strap is a little wonky and takes some getting used to, but it keeps the bulk of the headphones off your head, and the ear cups feel like cotton balls.Next, sound quality is out of this world. These sound better than my wired Sennheiser studio headphones. The mic quality, so far as I can tell, is great as well. I like being able to adjust the mic (my other headphones have a tiny mic hole built into one of the ear cups). And while I can oftentimes hear myself when I'm speaking (which is how I can tell the mic quality is en pointe), I don't hate hearing my voice like I would in other situations, like a recording of my voice.I also love that I can use the headphones (with mic) using a 3.5mm aux cable because my work computer has Bluetooth disabled, which I learned after buying these.Now for a shocker: I actually hate how the headphones adjust. I know, I know: I just said that helped make the headphones super comfy. Yes, that's true. But it's a springy strap with a hook-and-loop patch on one end: when the set is on my head, the strap wants to contract, making it tough to adjust. Then because I guess I have a smaller head, the two hook-and-loop patches don't meet, meaning there's a loose end of the strap that kinda flaps around. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.The other con is that these headphones are frustratingly difficult to connect over Bluetooth when multiple devices are paired. Even looking at the directions, I can't figure out what to push in what order to get them to switch, and I usually take a few minutes to get them to work on the computer I want to use them with. Frustrating, but I can live with it.",
          "Sounds fantastic, side tone/mic monitoring is probably the best I've experienced, works seamlessly with the Xbox Series X. Couple downsides (not dealbreakers for me): No mobile app, you can only edit settings using a PC and does NOT work on any Mac, Micro USB plug instead of USB-C.",
          "I bought this headset from son for Christmas a year ago. He has been using it every day. He loves his headset.",
          "Sounds is super clear, mic works great and batter life is impeccable",
          "First let me say these are comfortable. I'm sure your heard this already somewhere. The earcups are not sweaty and hot. Feel really good on the ears. The overall sound was just ok out of the box. The problem is you have to go to a PC everytime you wanna tweek the sound on these. It really needs an app. The balance in my set was not equal and no way of adjusting this. I returned these.",
          "It is very comfortable and fits my large head with a little room to spare. It has pretty good sound quality and I like the retractable mic. It\u2019s somewhat close in sound quality to my sennheiser I use for the tv. My one complaint is it doesn\u2019t have the boom I get in the sennheiser. When it comes to hearing everything around me, I hear it all.",
          "I like to think that when getting something with a high price tag that you're paying for both sound quality and durability. First few months with this headset was good to go and felt that I was getting my money's worth until it started rattling. The rattling would happen with some of the littlest movements and sometimes not at all. I had to spend money to buy a very specific screw driver just to get to the screws that held the speaker cover shut, remove the ear cup, unscrew to remove the plastic speaker cover to get to a chunk of plastic that snapped off and was rattling around. The plastic chunk was apparently a piece of the housing that was to help keep the metal (bracket? Bolt?) In place and to prevent from spinning around and twisting up wires. Less than three months later, another plastic chunk of the same area breaks off and now I have a loose ear cup that sits very uncomfortably on my ear that constantly needs to be readjusted and is so frustrating that I'm about ready to rip it apart.In short: I love the sound quality and ability to connect to my phone via Blu tooth but the durability and cheap plastic that supposed to hold it together will prevent me from getting this ever again.",
          "I've had 2 pairs of these over the last 2.25 years, the first one just straight up stopped working after about a year & 1 month, and the most recent one I've bought has lasted a year and 2 months but I can hear the left speaker starting to go in and out. It's not worth the price every year. Although I do admit, the sound is decent if you were immersed in gameplay and need to hear small details, but when you're in a party with other people that kind of goes away when you adjust the dial more than halfway between gaming and party chat. I also really enjoy the simultaneous dual connection between my Xbox and my phone, really useful for incoming calls and for music while gaming. Probably my favorite feature, but at this point it's not worth the $200 price tag. If they were to cut the price in half, I wouldn't mind paying $100 a year for yearly replacements, but I'm positive ya'll wouldn't \ud83d\ude02 so I do not reccomended these headphones if you want them to last more than a year and a half MAX.",
          "For a wireless headset that you are looking to only drop $100-300 on, this is the best I've tested. Turtle Beach Stealth Gen 2 came awfully close, but I felt the tuning on this was better, even after playing around with the settings. I did try the Nova Pro, but these are a bit more comfortable (breathable and no ANC bud touching your ear), and I could only recommend the Pro for only the looks or if you have multiple platforms you wish to hook up into the headset. Otherwise, for a console/PC use for wireless, this is hard to beat!",
          "I would be a bit less happy with these if I paid MSRP $200 instead of $55 open-box. No USB-C, and while the battery life is good they're slow to recharge. On one hand they're convenient with Xbox's proprietary connection tech, on the other hand if your console is in a bad location like inside a TV stand, they often lose connection. Because they also Bluetooth to your phone, when the Xbox connection is lost, the headphones are still on, and to reconnect you have to hold the power button to fully turn them off and back on again (takes like ten seconds). But the mic is great, the built in equalizer is a nice bonus (but you should still get the DTS:X app for $15 and select these 9X cans from their calibration system), the pads are pretty comfortable, they're overall light weight and good looking cans, and sound quality is good enough to use with music.",
          "If you want to use this on pc you can do it via Bluetooth but it's better to use an Xbox wireless adapter.",
          "Really can\u2019t beat up on these too much they are way less expensive than others. But I\u2019d definitely recommend buying others if you can afford to buy the PenroseX or a50 they have a price tag for a real reason in this category. The audio is okay and the volume isn\u2019t very loud. The mic is clear, but still too sensitive to background noise. Game and chat audio don\u2019t always mix correctly. For the price they are hands down better than anything as or less expensive(wireless)",
          "Out of the box most headphones sound horrible, that's no secret. Got these to replace my old Astro headsets I had for 5 years. Played with multiple different EQ profiles, YouTube videos, presets, external programs, Dolby Atmos, everything. Couldn't get rid of the hollow sound. Everything sounds like you are in a tin can. Ended up returning after configuring it for a day. Headphones were comfy and had no issues with connectivity at least.",
          "This headset is not as good as they say. I wanted a mid level back up headset to my Astro A50s and this wasn't it. I didn't expect top tier sound quality but I didn't even get mid level despite using the equalizer. I have used Plantronics RIGs that had better quality. As far as comfort, it misses it's mark. While the band fits nice on your head (with only 2 adjustable levels) the cups along with the noise canceling makes your head feels like it's swimming. With the mic passthrough turned all the way up it still wasn't good enough.The big thing for me was the speaker quality. They need to do better.",
          "Muy satisfecho con el producto recibido.",
          "I'll start off by saying this was a good headset while it lasted. It was comfortable to wear after breaking in, the ear pads didn't produce sweat, wasn't too tight either. The options to change the input and outputs on the PC app and carry over to Xbox was impressive. Sound in was pretty good, just without a good talk back mechanic. What was there for that feature needed to be turned on and even then it was faint.My biggest gripe would be the audio overflow it would seem to bug out. In a lot of cutscenes where maybe explosions would happen or even sometimes loading into a match, it would static out. Preventing you from talking or hearing, like you had a real bad connection to the console. Based off other reviews and other users I've talked to, its a hit or miss per person. Walking away from the console, even into just around the corner, would disconnect your headset and be difficult to reconnect and possibly just turn off. This is also just a problem with the Series X console, where the controller would do the same and possibly not reconnect even if powered on. The headset followed suit. This issue may have lead to the headset burning out. I disconnected the power from the console, turned it back on, turned on the headset afterwards. The headset beeped like it was powering up but never did. Following suit, it would not turn on again, nor charge on any cables. It wouldn't even connect hardwired to my console or PC. I believe the headset just short circuited somehow during its own boot up.*EDIT: changed score from 2-4 stars. The headset seemed to had hard locked itself in some bizarre fashion and just needed a press on the reset button. If anyone else has the same issue, it\u2019s under the ear cuff of the non mic side/ side with all the buttons and charger. Needs a paper clip to reach through the tiny hole.TLDR, Good headset if it stays in the same room as your device, but will still have connectivity issues during heavy audio loads on series x.",
          "I never buy anything electronic unless it's new but I took a chance and bought the steelseries arctis 9x like-new. It came in the original package and there is zero sign that it was ever used. Everything connected has it should, the bluetooth to my phone and the pairing with my xbox series x. I basically paid $74 for a brand new headset that cost up to $200 at times.",
          "BUYER BEWARE: DECENT PRODUCT BUT AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! BUY FROM ASTRO, TURTLE BEACH, LUICID SOUND, OR HYPER X INSTEAD! BETTER SOUND AND BUILD QUALITY USUALLY FOR LESS.  DONT BELIEVE THE SPONSORED \"BEST HEADSETS\" LISTS!First off, I NEVER take the time to write reviews. Also, I have purchased and used about every flagship wireless surround headset and several higher end wired from every major manufacturer for the past 6 years XBox One has been out.  I've purchased them for myself and my three children as well as given them to friends and family due to dissatisfaction for one reason or another.  I have owned the Stealth 500X, Stealth Elite 800X, Stealth 700X and the Wired Stealth 90Xfrom Turtle Beach, Wired Cloud Core X and Stinger 2 from Hyper X, Astro A40 and A50 (for both my PS4s and XBox Ones.) If you're wondering why so many, children break things and I usually play with the right earcup slightly offset to hear my family if they call or need something.  It typically causes some stress on the plastic frame swivel joints and usually the joint cracks after a year or so. Plus, I'm a technophile/audiophile and I have been chasing the high quality experience that I had with the original Turtle Beach Stealth 500X headset (which was discontinued or I would have bought another)Overall the product is admittedly good, I really liked the light weight and great sound.  Being able to connect to my Bluetooth phone, computer, or stereo on the fly was great.  Descent sound quality (a little more flat sounding music and ambiance than others I've used, but it picks up footsteps and game audio cues well) and compatible with Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos software which helps. Good mic quality too.HOWEVER, after a few months of regular use and good care the left ear driver stated intermittently going out.  I called customer service when it stopped working all together and they walked me through some troubleshooting and showed me how to do the factory reset using a paperclip to press the reset located in the ear piece.  This would take care of the problem for a while, but ultimately it ended up failing and refused to come back on.  I was still well within the year warranty so I contacted customer service again and told them what was going on.  They informed me that they couldn't verify my purchase because I bought it through a third party retailer (Amazon) so I need to pursue a return though Amazon first.  Amazon stated that it wasn't covered in the A-Z policy and it was outside the window for returns. Plus, because it was an accessory that was worn and an electronic, they couldn't give me and exchange or even a partial refund credit.So when I contacted SteelSeries again, they had me take a bunch of photos and send an invoice from Amazon, which I did a few different times and they kept telling me it wasn't an official invoice screenshot, (it was a receipt, a purchase confirmation, and a shipment and delivery confirmation email and screenshot for each respective time. All of which had the order number, tracking number and my personal information and address.) So I finally asked them to  walk me through which specific invoice I had to generate from Amazon and where to obtain it.  Finally, they told me they still couldn't confirm the legitimacy of my purchase and warranty status despite the specified documentation and photographs including the serial number and condition of the headset they had asked for. So they told me to send the product in (which I had to pay for postage on and shipped 2-day priority) after a week I was notified that the battery was dead (no kidding the headset wasn't working at all on one side and I had been using a backup) but stated that nothing was wrong and I just needed to charge it.  I got it back and the headset still didn't work on the left side and wasn't wanting to stay on now and kept disconnecting.  (Despite having a full overnight charge). The headset also came back with a HORRIBLE stale, sour, body odor smell, which they basically called me a liar about.  I had specifically cleaned the ear cushions and let them dry completely) before shipping because I figured someone would be having to put it on. Plus, I always kept my headset on a stand and wiped it down after playing as I'm a bit of a clean freak.  I knew it was B.S. and it upset me that they kept telling me the headset was fine and that there was no odor.They finally told me I could send it back (Again, my cost) so I sent it as is to prove the odor existed and told them I was doing so. Once again told me that nothing was wrong.  They kept indirectly insinuating that I was a liar or just trying to get over on them and get a new headset. Then told me that the headset was stinking when they received it and basically suggested that it was due to my personal hygiene.I would think that SteelSeries wouldn't appreciate a few lazy or dirtbag employees ruining their brand's reputation by being rude or discourteous to customers, but it sure as hell happened.  I don't think they ever tested the headset properly or at all.  The fact that they didn't help at all, called me a liar, and I was left with a stinking broken headset now outside the warranty window and I guess I'm blacklisted because they won't return my messages, despite being polite in my correspondence and always thanking them when they helped remotely.Pretty good headset for the six-months or so it lasts, but absolutely shit-tier customer service that only calls you a liar and refuses to even give you an opportunity to pay for a repair or even give a discount or credit towards a replacement.",
          "After using these for about a month now I can say this really is a great headset. I used to be a loyal Turtle Beach customer, 3 headsets in a row over more than a decade, but since they haven\u2019t released a new flagship in awhile, I decided to finally give the competition a try.For starters the construction is great as you should expect from a $150+ pair of headphones. I\u2019ve always been wary of the dual band (solid segment and adjustable strap or part) because it essentially makes 2 points of failure in addition to possible balance issues but thankfully, the 9X has a metal support band and it feels fantastic. It keeps it centered where you place it on your head very well and should last much longer than a plastic band. The strap surpassed my expectations. It is easily adjustable and the flexibility feels like it was made specifically for putting something on your head, not to mention it is soft and doesn\u2019t cause chafing at all. The earcups are essentially monolithic solid pieces. The only piece that is a worry for failure, especially from fatigue, is the connection between the earcups and the band. It is just a single piece of curved plastic and not all that thick. Its connection points between the band and earcups seem to be metal standoffs or similar (bearings and whatnot) so that should be okay (it's the general design SteelSeries has been using for a long time so I assume it works). They hopefully shouldn\u2019t be all that load bearing but it is the only segment I would improve in the design. The volume scroll wheels feel good, not too loose not too stiff.I was impressed with the comfort of these. I have glasses and have 0 issues whatsoever. In fact, I would say if you are WORRIED about the comfort with glasses with headsets I might point you towards these specifically for that itself. The cushions feel nice and are more breathable than I expected. There has been one heck of a heat wave recently so I\u2019ve been gaming in 80+ degrees inside and haven\u2019t experienced any sweating issues (I don\u2019t sweat all that much in general however). The distance from the cushions to the speakers is not that deep, if you have ears that stick out farther than average you may find yourself rubbing the inside. The squeeze on the head isn\u2019t much, I saw some reviews spitting out values but it doesn\u2019t mean anything till you try. Playing for hours on end I haven\u2019t had any soreness, pain, etc. from the pressure but I am extremely used to wearing headphones so it may just be me. The cushions do help though, no hotspots or pressure points. The moveability of the earcups with the help of the strap should allow basically anyone to find a comfortable position with this headset.On to sound. I\u2019m not much of an audiophile and haven\u2019t 100% tested these to every sound degree but I can agree with some online reviews that they aren\u2019t the best for listening to music. It seems like the mixing is very tailored to games. It doesn\u2019t sound bad by any means but the default sound presets (flat, bass boost, smiley, focus) do not bring out anything music wise and I find myself using \u201cflat\u201d almost exclusively since it provides the best range imo. In-game I find no issues: they do their job, have good surround, and catch everything happening but I personally can\u2019t find much difference between these and my old Turtle Beach XO 7 pro (rip old friend) aside from maybe very minor frequency equalization. In the SteelSeries pc download you can adjust very little to actually mix the headset yourself so it is mostly what you get at the start. The volume adjust (and speech vs in-game) provides enough to find the level you want. It had noise canceling I believe and there's no option to turn it off but I think it mitigates decently enough, I\u2019m no longer in a louder environment so it is hard for me to tell.I\u2019d say this is a very ergonomic headset to wear: the retractable mic is a lot cooler and better than I expected, I\u2019ve said previously you can easily get it to sit comfortably on your head, and the buttons are spread out and feel different enough to find everything quickly and easily. Connecting to both an Xbox and PC or phone are easy as heck and it is incredibly cool you can do both at once. It definitely provides an avenue to play cross-plat games with people in a discord. The microphone is clear and sounds great. The battery life is phenomenal (and one of the main reasons I chose this over the Turtle Beach Stealth 700). Right out of the box it lasted me the whole week, at least 20 hours. I have been charging it once a week since, with the charge time being fast enough to take a break, watch some shows or something, and you\u2019re good to go.Okay, everything sounds great so far but, headsets are VERY unique per person and I do have quite a few gripes. It has been said before that it takes like 6-7 seconds to turn them on and yeah, it does. No reason for it to be more than 2-3 seconds to hold that dumb power button. I\u2019ve experienced a few instances where I turn them on, they connect, and then they turn off again within a second or two. Really weird but it has never happened in-game or anything. It may be some sequencing thing with my xbox and controller, I dunno, but it has happened more than I would like. The mic is INCREDIBLY sensitive, be wary. I never, ever, ever, have had a problem with my headsets picking up my fans before but now I do, it was so bad I almost returned them instantly. I went into the SteelSeries Engine and there is a mic volume option which I turned down to the minimum. It mitigated it enough to where I can use them and even when it does \u201cpick\u201d it up, I think it doesn't really register any sound now. I had to adjust my overall setup to accommodate for this and it now can pick up me just walking around due to the air moving, a bit of an issue since I like to pace. This caused me to sound fairly quiet in chat though so I had to move the mic closer to my mouth than I used to. I think it would do SteelSeries good to have a foam tip or some other method to prevent air/fan issues and general noise damping. Having the buttons and scroll wheels on the back of the earcups sounds like a good idea in principle, easy to reach, out of the way, etc. but on these they are so spread out and the scroll wheels are almost exactly where you put your hands when grabbing the headset to pick up and put down that you need to be careful not to touch them, else you have to change your volume back every single time you use them. Just a nitpick I know, I plan on getting a vertical stand for these so I don't lay the headset down on its side for this reason too. The little booklet they include is basically as minimal as you can get. The look is pretty basic, it was probably what they were going for but if the strap didn\u2019t have the green X flair it would look like a generic solid matte black headset. I like a bit of spice, some highlights here and there ya know, nothing too much but something subtle would be nice. I\u2019m not a super serious sound mixing studio enthusiast needing to be professional but I\u2019m also not some RGB psycho, everyone's tastes are different.All in all, this is a really good gaming headset. It\u2019s hard NOT to recommend. I definitely endorse spending the extra money to get a headset at least in the $100+ range as the difference between a $50-70 and an $100-150 is night and day. At the end of the day, you simply have to test things like this out to see if it works for you. I truly, almost returned it due to the mic issue alone (I literally activated the return but fiddled with it until I got it usable) but after using it for a month now, I do enjoy it. There\u2019s a lot of options out there and trying everything would take not only a lot of $$$ but a lot of time too, something not many of us have, so if I can find something that I can get to at least WORK, I am usually content",
          "Buckle up! it going to be a bumpy ride, but if you're looking for the perfect pair of headphones (under $200)... I can't give you a great answer because they dont exist. I can tell you however one of the two best that have ALMOST everything with VERY FEW compromises.To start, I'll explain my methods and what I was looking for. I used Rtings.com scores as the basis for what to try based on sounds and features. I have some very specific deal-breakers and absolute requirements. Hopefully my analysis will help you make your own decisions.First an important point that not everyone may have known. Bluetooth wireless has gotten very good, especially with advanced codecs like aptX. It can sound really good if you have a phone or device AND headphones that support it, but it deafults to crappier sound if one of them does not, and will always have a significant delay (200-400ms). This PROBABLY IS enough to notice when watching a movie, but YMMV. I've made the assumption that this is not good enough and was trying to find one with non-BT wireless which is \"lossless\" (perfect quality and undetectable lag). BT and non-BT wireless both use the 2.4 MHz spectrum (along with lots of other things like WiFi) but \"non-BT\" wireless is kind of a vague term that is supposed to mean VERY high quality or \"loss-less\" audio and low latency (compared to BT). However, every manufacturer seems to have their own version of the technology and there is at least on example of non-BT wireless that has terrible latency (Jabra). I think it is almost a typo because it basically has the latencey of BT, so I think they might actually jsut be implementing a proprietary version of it rather than HQ/lossless wireless transmission.So let's breakdown all of my must-have features:1. They must be able to be used while charging (it's crazy to me that any pair would not have this, but it's more commmon than you'd think and you can filter for it on RTINGS). A great battery can compensate for this, but the only thing worse than running out of battery is being completely incapable of using them while they charge. I want this for conference calling and if you dont have this, you're literally cut off from communicating until they recharge.2. They must have \"passive playback\" meaning you can use them with a standard headphone cable while they're turned off (or with a dead battery). This may not be essential to many, especially since many phones have gotten rid of the headphone jack, but I consider is a deal-breaker.3. It must have \"good\" wireless. I started out thinking I NEEDED NON-Bluetooth wireless as a feature, but I had to ditch that because there are only THREE MODELS (out of the 547 evaluated on Rtings.com) that have #1 and 2, and also both bluetooth and non-bluetooth wireless.4. Audio recording quality is also essential since I'm using these for zoom calls all day (and gaming, thus why I wanted non-BT wireless for better latency). I'm not picky about having a boom mic, but it has to have a good quality mic. This is subjective, but it sems like this means a score of >6-6.5 (they have actual sample recordings on Rtings) and I found that a score of 5.7 sounded awful, but 6.7 was plenty good.5. I'd really like to have ACTIVE noise cancelling (ANC) but it isn't a dealbreaker. I especially want this if I'm going to spend >200. I want this in general for travel because if I'm going to spend this much, I'd like to be able to use them everywhere.So, with criteria 1-4, there were 3 remaining models (#4 recording quality didn't actually filter any out). I've listed them below with the major drawback that has made me reconsider my search:Jabra Evolve2 - $350, but non-BT wireless latency is terrible, it's basically just proprietary BT and thus the latency, but it cant technically be called BTSteelSeries Arctis 9 or 9x - $200, but no active noise cancelling, terrible non-BT wireless qualityArctis Pro - $350, but no ANCThe Evolve2 are the ones that seemed to have the proprietary non-BT wireless, which explains it's terrible latency and I'm not willing to spend that much for something that doesn't have loss-less audio. I did not buy these to try, but did buy the \"elite 85h\" because I assumed that they would share the wireless connectivity latency problem.The Jabra elite 85h are a really good pair, a little pricier at $250, but the crappy lag on the non-BT wireless was immediately evident and was reason I eliminated them. They were able to connect to both my pc and phone well, but while using the microphone for any reason, there was a loud audible hiss present. I think this may have been \"side-tone\" which is where it plays back the mirophone input so you can hear yourself when you speak, but I could not hear much of myself, and it was a hiss at ~20 volume which was simply unusable (loud enough that I couldn't hear my zoom participants well...) This actually does NOT have passive playback (via headphone cord with no battery/power) and this discovery is the reason I added this criteria.The Steelseries 9x were absolutely terrific...SOME of the time. Using the wireless on anything but an xbox requires a microsoft xbox wireless adapter, but I had frewquent intermittant problems (that are all over the internet and have not been resolved as of 2020). I consider the non-BT wireless problems to be an actual defect and eventually returned them because of the weird noises that were basically nonstop. Despite this, and despite the lack of ANC, the BT and overall quality was stellar. I tried it on many different windows computers and nothing solved it.I actually ended up keeping the Steelseries 9 (not 9X) which amazon does not sell, and I had to get directly from the manufacturer. They are my daily home pair, they work great, and are SUPER comfortable. The BT is surprisingly worse than the 9 and I cant imagine why it would be any different, but it is. Still all-around the bestI decided not to even try the arctis pro because they were so expensive, but also because of the hub that it uses. I believe the hub is only necessary for the non-BT wireless, but I'm also just not willing to pay that much for a pair without ANC.JBL Quantum 800 - $200, this is a great pair that has almost everything, but not quite. The BT and non-BT wireless audio quality was great and the recording quality was great (boom mic). However, the battery life is almost insufferably bad, and, to add insult to injury, they cannot be used while charging. This was actually the second pair that that I bought, and is the reason I added criteria #1. They were also not very comfortable, but not the worst (none can compete with the comfort of the Steelseries). One wierd issues that may be present in other devices (but not the 9x) is that when the headset is turned off, the device in windows does not deactivate, meaning windows still keep playing audio on the non-existant device rather than switch to your next default. This means you have to manually select a different audio source when you turn them off.My final pick was the Seinhausser PXC 550-II. While these also do not have non-BT wireless connectivity, they have great BT wireless (AptX, low laency) and all the other features I wanted: great sound, great microphone, great battery, great ANC, passive playback, playback while charging (and can actually play directly over USB). The only slight negatives are the touch controls (intuitive, but easy to hang up on people if you stretch your arms in the air) comfort (again, cant compete with steelseries) and bluetooth connectivity. It says it can connect to two devices at once, and while this is true, you basically need to disable your phone or pc bluetooth to get it to work right. This took me the longest time to figure out, but it works great now.If I had to pick one pair now, it would be the Seinhausser pair. They have it all: great for travel, great battery, great sound, great mic, great battery/charging, good comfort, everything.The next best are the steelseries 9, which are better in some ways (comfort, non-BT wireless, chatmix, boom mic) but canty compete with the 30hour battery, ANC, and portability of the Seinhausser pair.",
          "Have had for a few months as my main gaming headset and everything either works perfect or won't connect. Through some research I eventually moved everything to 5g and power cycle our modem/ router which seems to fix the connection issues. We have 3 xboxs in the house and have only had issues on 3 occasions since initially setting up. Audio is great, mic is decent and headset is lightweight",
          "I purchased the SteelSeries Arctis 9X to replace a Razer Chimaera 5.1 that I had been gifted in the XBox 360 days and continued to use with my XBox One for several years. Much of this review will be a comparison with my older Razer Chimaera 5.1.The sound quality of the SteelSeries Arctis 9X was immediately noticeable as an improvement over the Razer. The Razer has a very hyped sound--over-accentuated low and high frequencies with a terrible weak mid-range. The SteelSeries Arctis 9X is flatter and more accurate across the range of frequencies compared to the Razer, and offers a bit more detail too. BUT, if I compare both or either of them to a pair of $80 Grado SR60e headphones (granted, those are wired, and have no mic), neither of the gaming headphones sound very good. The less-expensive Grados are head-and-shoulders better sounding, with much better detail and articulation than either SteelSeries or Razer 'phones.Still, since the SteelSeries sound noticeably better than the Razer Chimaera 5.1s, I count this as a win.The comfort of the SteelSeries Arctis 9Xs is quite good. The ear cups are comfortably padded to fit around the ear, and there is a cloth strip that the headband rides on, cushioning the top of your head as well. (Arctis calls it the \"Ski Goggle Headband\", for reasons that escape me.) The downside of this cloth strip is that it makes the SteelSeries 'phones a bit easy to pivot off the back of your head, for example when you lay down on the couch while gaming.They are more comfortable than the Razers, so this is another win for the Arctis 9X.The controls for the SteelSeries Arctis 9X are good. The power button to turn it on and off feels different (it's convex) than the Bluetooth button (which is concave). That's good, because you don't want to always take the headphones off of your head to look at the controls. Also, controlling volume is done with a real trimpot, not an up and down button like the Razer. That's good too--trimpots can be changed at whatever speed you want with instant feedback, not laboriously by repeatedly clicking a button up or down.Another win for the SteelSeries.The Razer Chimaera's base station/stand/charger plugs into the optical output of the XBox 360 or XBox One, and as soon as you turn things on the headphones are receiving sound. That's easy. With the SteelSeries Arctis 9X, you have to pair the headphones with the XBox One. Arctis advertises this as a superior method--for example their website for the 9X has as it's very first bullet point, \"Integrated Xbox Wireless means no cables or dongle required - connects just like a controller\u2028\". In practice, at least in my opinion, pairing is an extra step that gives no advantage. It's not awful, but I preferred the Razer's always-working audio. In this comparison, I give the point to the Razer, but it's a small point. The SteelSeries pairing worked well, and although it's an extra step it is not a hard step.And now we come to the place in the review when the SteelSeries Arctis 9X's real weakness appears. Charging. This is a big annoyance.When I was done with the Razer Chimaera 5.1 headphones, I would put them back on their stand. Contacts in the stand connect with contacts in the headband of the Razer headphones, and the headphones would charge. This is easy, and works very well. It's easy to do, even late at night.In contrast, when I'm done with the SteelSeries Arctis 9X headphones, there is no stand. There is no automatic charging. The solution offered by SteelSeries to charge these headphones is a mini-USB jack. Stupid. Fiddly. Not even a USB-C jack, which would still be fiddly but at least it doesn't care which direction you plug it in. Nope, none of that easy plugging in! Stupid stupid mini-USB.This is a big loss for the SteelSeries 9X. Charging is stupid and painful.To improve the situation a little bit I bought a stand that offered USB ports in the base. Specifically, I bought this stand:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779V6BC4/It's alright. But even with a stand and handy nearby USB ports, charging up the 9X is far inferior to the Razer Chimaera.In summary, the SteelSeries Arctis 9X headphones are pretty good. They improve in a lot of ways over my previous set of headphones. But it's a three steps forward, one step back kind of situation, and I really dislike the way you have to charge them.",
          "Great headset for long hour gaming and very comfy all day long, only issue I have with the headset; can hear my ceiling fan in my room (static noise) and people in game chat be like oh you have a shitty mic etc. That\u2019s way too sensitive. I have the Xbox series x so can\u2019t use software gg. Xbox chats are ok but it\u2019s only call of duty I\u2019m having a issue with.For the best Xbox headset I really didn\u2019t think I would have this issue. I\u2019m prob going try turtle beach 700 max.",
          "Worth your money",
          "I\u2019ve been using these for a total of about 40 hours now and I have had an overall positive experience.To start I have not experienced any of the connection issues expressed by other reviewers. That\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t have those issues they could have had a bad unit or some software updates could have gone through to help. If I do start to experience them I will update this review. Connecting to the Xbox was quick and easy and it connects right away every time I power them on.Having the ability to do Bluetooth while using Xbox wireless is a great feature. I love relaxing with some Minecraft and playing my own music via Bluetooth to the headset and having the audio mixed well together is great. I briefly used them as standalone Bluetooth headphones and they worked and sounded well.My teammates have no complaints over the mic quality. They didn\u2019t rave about it or anything they basically just said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d. The mute button is easy to find and the mic has a nice bright red light to let you know it\u2019s muted. One complaint with the mic is I wish it muted itself when you retracted it back into the headphones but the only way to mute is with the button. I\u2019m not a big fan of the retracting mic, I prefer flip up to mute style. Although if you intend to wear them out as Bluetooth headphones the retracting mic looks better.The comfort is my favorite feature of steel series headsets. The ski band head band is very comfy and I love the ear cup material. No issues wearing them for 5 hours straight.Audio quality is great. I\u2019m no audiophile but I was hearing details and footsteps that I wasn\u2019t hearing with my sennheisers. The EQ feature is a nice bonus. They also get very loud to the point where I never run them at full volume.Battery life is fine, unless you are playing for crazy 20 hour marathons just remember to plug them in when you are done and you won\u2019t have to worry about running out.Overall I would recommend this headset and I think it\u2019s worth the price. The quality concerns expressed by other reviewers left me hesitant but amazon has a great return policy if I got a dud. The comfort, sound quality and ability to do Bluetooth and Xbox wireless at the same time really make these a winner for me. Hopefully I won\u2019t need to update my review in the future.",
          "These are great if you're looking for headphones that have simultaneous audio for multiple devices. I've always looked down on \"gaming\" branded products as they tend to have a reputation for poor quality compared to regular products. This seems to be one of the exceptions. Basically if you're in a typical home environment without a need for noise cancellation and you want to keep headphones on all day, then you probably want these.SIMULTANEOUS SOUNDThese are some of the only wireless headphones that offer simultaneous sound because it does it through 2 sources - wireless and bluetooth. I briefly considered the high-end Sony and Bose headphones but discarded those options because despite marketed as multi-point, you still need to disconnect and reconnect every single time. I had to do that with my Jabras and Bose Quietcomforts and the hassle made it near unusable. These Nova 7x headphones are able to relay the sound from two simultaneous sources (one wireless, one bluetooth), which allows me to keep my headphones on for both my main entertainment devices without touching any settings.LATENCYI don't game much, but when I do, these produced some of the lowest latencies according to rtings. They are gaming headphones, after all.RANGEYou'll need to connect the receiver to the included USB-A extender because the interference from your device will reduce the range dramatically, but once it's connected, just move the receiver away from the PC. I'm able to receive audio from several rooms away through several walls by doing so. The bluetooth range is higher than my Bose Quietcomfort 2s.COMFORTBecause I wear my headphones for long periods at a time, comfort is a big deal to me. I bought the Bose Quietcomforts for that reason as it's regarded as the most comfortable pair of headphones on the market. However, what I realized after wearing different headphones over the years is comfort issues largely stem from the earpads. Shallow earpads will sometimes make the components inside the headphones poke at your ears causing pain. This is easily fixed with 3rd-party earpads, so I'd recommend against buying any headphones for comfort reasons alone. A second, more minor contributor to comfort is the degree to which the strap squeezes on your head. There's a tradeoff here - cheaper materials are flimsy and don't squeeze very strong, so they fall off your head easily but feel more comfortable than higher quality materials. Here, the 7x made a compromise - the top band is a fabric hammock that rests on your head, so it's simultaneously more comfortable than hard plastic while keeping the build quality reasonable. All in all, these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned - moreso than the Bose Quietcomforts - after replacing the earpads with thicker 3rd-party ones.ALTERNATIVESSonys, Razers, Bose, etc. Noise-canceling headphones: if noise cancellation is your top priority, then I'd go with a noise-cancelling pair of headphones. However, it will come with severe drawbacks. For instance, one common use of noise cancellation is on airplanes, but you need a wired connection to connect to the airplane entertainment system. Most headphones' noise cancellation features are disabled if a wired connection is used, and some headphones don't even have a wired connection option at all. Some do, but the implementation is so utterly awful that it might as well not exist (e.g., Arctis Nova Pro). Most of the time, if you're at home, there's not enough noise for noise cancellation to matter, and if there is, then you might not even want noise cancellation (e.g., if somebody is calling for you - you need to hear them). Similarly, if you're on public transportation or walking around the streets, noise cancellation will end up posing a safety risk if you can't hear important noises around you.Wired headphones: no matter how much reviewers rave about sound quality, there's no comparison to a decent pair of wired headphones. If sound quality is the only thing you care about, then pick up a pair of wired headphones and call it a day. For me, the convenience of simultaneous sound and wireless freedom beats out the additional sound quality, but to be honest, I have a pair of $40 wired headphones that sound better than the $400 Bose and Sony bluetooth pairs I've used in the past. Wireless is not where sound quality's at.Special mention: Arctis Nova Pro. These are marketed as an upgrade to the Nova 7x but are simply inferior. Based on the RTings sound reproduction breakdown, as long as you get a good fit on your head, which you will if you get 3rd party earpads, the Nova 7x produces similar if not better sound than the Nova Pro for about half the price. The latency is better than the Nova Pro. The Nova Pro has a nifty console that controls a lot of its features, but that console has massive design flaws - you'll go deaf from the tones every single time you adjust anything. It also prevents you from using your headphones via direct wired connection, which makes it difficult to use on places like airplanes.",
          "It's a really nice headset.  Great distance too. I can be in between rounds,  run to the kitchen for a drink that's 50 feet and 3 rooms away and stays connected.  Great sound quality.  Never had it due on me.  It's great",
          "Edit: Unable to find an alternative wireless headset for my needs, namely Xbox and PC capable, at a reasonable price. I tried this headset again.Again the device bricked, this time within a day or so, however I now know why it is bricking. Unlike some of steelseries other headsets this headset cannot handle being too far away from the plugged in dongle. Leaving the room with my wireless headset on my head I can walk maybe 10 feet before the sound cracks and the headset if not immediately brought closer will brick.Fortunately, this time my headset does actually have the reset button it is supposed to have and it works to reset the device. However this is an expensive WIRELESS headset, to have such an issue is embarrassing.If you are unsure of what bricking is here is the gist, the hardware is powered on (in this case) but loses all functionality INCLUDING the power button meaning it is stuck on and cannot use the headset or reboot. As described in the subject, this product bricked 26 days after Amazon's (turns out false) return window. (I'll get to why it's false at the he end for those interested)Second problem with this headset, the fix is a reset button in a pinhole under the ear cover. The pinhole should be in EITHER the left or right speaker, in my case there was a pinhole in both. NEITHER pinhole had a reset button inside, believe I tried to find the clickable button it does not exist. Therefore it is impossible to reset the bricked device.Lastly, I gave Steelseries customer service a descriptive message about my problem, the response I got was to and I quote \"Try factory resetting your Xbox Series X console\". The device wasn't even connected to the console. That suggestion was so far away from helpful I decided not even to bother with this terrible service because it would take hours just to make them understand what the actual problem was.About Amazon's shady return window. Fortunately, I bought Asurion insurance for the device because in 'My Orders' Amazon showed the device was no longer eligible for return, expired after 1 month I think. So I contacted Asurion the insurance Amazon uses. They refuse to honor policy because as it turned out after an hour long phone call, AMAZON has a secret return policy window for certain products like electronics one that apparently you would only know if you called and got a real person to file the return. Amazon MUST cover the product for X amount of time before Asurion will pay for it, so the return window you see in orders is actually a lie, (and in my opinion) designed to make people take a loss on their broken product.",
          "I think this is a really good headset perfect for playing for long periods of time, very comfortable and the 20 hour battery life is true, but I dropped my headset and the connector for the headphone broke and now it hangs off of my ear and Is uncomfortable, durability is not good but the headset is",
          "I have an XBox 1 and XBox Series S and have had issues trying to find a good headphone with a mic to play ESO.Just got my headphones on 1 Feb 23 and about 2 hrs into the ESO I\u2019m loving the product. The sound is crisp and clear and I haven\u2019t had any issue with the mic.My headphones were owned and only cost me about $70. So far no complains and worth the price I paid.",
          "Oh boy. These things are nice. Upgraded from the Plantronics Rig800LX because I wanted something with direct-connect to the Xbox. First thing I did was Bluetooth connect them to my phone to check general sound quality. I listened to some music that is particularly demanding for headphones I\u2019ve owned in the past and they performed exceptionally well. The Bluetooth connection is very reliable too; every time I turn on the headphones they immediately connect to my phone, and I\u2019ve had issues in the past with the reliability of Bluetooth headphone auto-pairing.As for gaming, they are superb. I can actually hear footsteps from a ridiculous distance, something like 25-30 meters. It was a bit overwhelming at first to try and pinpoint footsteps in the cacophony of crystal-clear, distinct sounds I was hearing. I have since adjusted, and at some point will plug them into my PC to update firmware and make some custom sound profiles to reign in the distant footsteps so I can hear the forest from the trees so to speak.Party chat/volume controls: the volume controls are a bit too easy to adjust. The volume wheels have no resistance, meaning dialing them in can be a teeter-totter of overshooting your goal and having to fiddle quite a bit. Also if you\u2019re scratching your head, or making an adjustment to fit it\u2019s easy to bump the wheel skyrocketing the volume which can be jarring. Being aware of this after the first few times has made this a non issue. One major complaint I had about the Plantronics Rig800LX set was that the balance control for game volume/party chat had to be within a specific range or the sound would distort. This is not the case with the Steelseries set. You can adjust it to your liking without sacrificing audio quality.Battery life is great, they lasted for a week and a half of gaming 2 hr a day, a bit more over the weekend, so roughly 18-20 hr.Connection is very good; however, last night there was a slight bit of cutting out for just a few minutes after I paused Bluetooth music and left Bluetooth connected, but quickly went away after I disconnected Bluetooth (maybe interference from other sources too as we have a large number of wireless devices in a small room, including 2 wireless receivers for our surround sound system).Overall I think my complaints are minimal, and considering the quality and features, these are probably the best set available. I was willing to spend $300 or more but I also wanted Bluetooth, and these seemed like the best. I would like to have a more convenient charging solution instead of a cable, like some sort of dock to set them in, but a magnetic micro-usb cable with adapter is on its way and that\u2019ll be just fine. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!",
          "My personal preference is to have a toggle power button instead of a software button, not a big deal. This software button is terrible. Not sure why I have to hold it for an arbitrary amount of time, but it's damn annoying. Also really hard to determine what the state of the device is. It may be on, but volume is on zero, then there's no way of knowing if it's on or not. Bloody annoying.Then if you're trying to get it to make a sound, and do something wrong with the button (still not sure what) the headset goes into total sleeper mode. The power button cannot do anything to it, even a hardware reset does nothing to it. The only way I have found to get it out of sleeper mode is to wait a few days for the battery to run down, and charge it again. Bloody annoying when you try to do a customer call but your headset is still in sleeper mode.For the price I paid, I expect a lot more. I have gotten a lot more from much cheaper headsets.",
          "I watched some reviews complaining that these tend to lean towards the higher frequency range. I prefer that because of some hearing loss. However they also have strong bass.Out of the box with flat settings, I was not that impressed. Then I used the \"Sonic\" equalizer that comes with  there SteelSeries GG Client software. You can adjust them to whatever you prefer and sounds great thru all frequencies. The best part is the Sonic software will work with any audio out device. It made my Altec Lansing PC speakers pop. I was thinking of getting new PC / Gaming / etc... speakers. No need. They sound great now that they are also tuned.",
          "Love the sound when you can find the right spot with the voice chat/game noise wheel. It can be great but the issue is that it all just feels like incredibly cheap plastic. After having A50s for years these just feel like knock off headphones but have great sound. I had a pair of Steelseries back in 2013 that were better made quality than these",
          "Great headset. Sometimes it struggles to maintain connection to Xbox. It crackles and skips every once in a while. In my experience, Microsoft Bluetooth isn\u2019t great with my controller and headset, so it isn\u2019t the product\u2019s fault, but I\u2019ve had better experience with headsets that use the Bluetooth dongle on Xbox."

          "Update 6 months after purchase-Had them on the charger for a few hours, unplugged for a gaming session. About an hour in they turned off automatically, and won't turn back on. Nothing happens when the charger is plugged in even for a period of time. They are now completely worthless. Don't waste your money on this expensive paper weight. Buy a corded set and be done with lackluster wireless performance from \"top brands.\"I bought two sets of these because they were touted as one of the best wireless headsets for Xbox one, one for myself and one for my girlfriend. Figured would be a nice Christmas gift. They sound great, have cool features like built in equalizer presets and the mic mute indicator (very handy for reminding you of being muted so you don't wonder why your friends aren't answering you). We're both pretty happy with overall performance vs cost with some exceptions. My headset was functionally perfect out of the box, while my girlfriends seems to have had an issue with the volume roller (right ear cup) causing static in the speakers, and she has to mess with it to get a clear sound almost every time she puts them on. Needless to say, she's not super impressed with build quality, and I'm even less so because of this. It's really, really, really not hard to make a quality, fault-free rheostat resistor, it just costs a little more than a dollar. We're also both having some very annoying connectivity issues with our Xboxes. I have a 2015 Fallout 4 bundle model and she has the newer One S purchased April 2019, both 1G units. Long story short I had a blowout in my back so I've been laying on the floor less than 6 feet from my Xbox with nothing between me and it. Even being this close I have pretty consistent blips of loss of sound and a smidge of static presumably from some sort of interference, and she has reported the same being slightly farther away from hers. While we're on the topic of distance, these units have an absolutely Terrible range for being \"bluetooth\" wireless (I use the quotations because Xbox uses a proprietary wireless communications protocol that isn't exactly bluetooth simply because not all bluetooth devices can connect to it, and they presumably did this to either be different than PlayStation or for security concerns). Either headset we have drops connection when we walk into the kitchen. Granted line of sight is obstructed, it's less than 20 feet away from our Xboxes. We also both have moments where the headset loses connection with the Xbox, often causing need for a reboot of the headset in order to reconnect regardless of distance/line of sight with the Xboxes. Extremely annoying mid-raid in Destiny 2.. or any time really. I've also experienced numerous times where I turn them on, they connect and I get sound for maybe 5 seconds and then nothing, so I go to reboot and after holding the power button to turn them off, they make the sound indicator for turning on, after having already been turned on, and then they connect and it's fine. Its worth noting that we both experience all these issues while playing independently or at the same time. It doesn't seem to matter. After having done some research into our connectivity issues regarding interference with/from other devices such as routers, wireless surround sound units, etc, the only other wireless devices we have on while playing are our phones, usually a few feet away from the headsets while worn, and of course the router is on. I've long ago disabled the 2G band on our router because we don't use it, which disabling one or the other band is a suggested solution. But, we live in an apartment and we have a number of other routers in range of my phone so perhaps we're getting external interference, I'm not 100% sure yet, but in the case that we are, I think engineering/communications protocols require improving to alleviate this seemingly widespread issue. I'm not super impressed with these because of all this, and for the price I could have gotten a couple much nicer wired sets that would be much more reliable and give me that boomier bass that these are a little lackluster on. As I write this review my headset is cutting out and losing/regaining connection, and again I'm on the floor less than 6 feet away, which in my annoyance has prompted me to write this review.One last gripe about this headset, as confirmed by myself, my girlfriend, and a gamer friend in the UK who also bought these, you have to remember to turn the headset off before turning off the Xbox, otherwise with the headset still powered on, the Xbox will turn itself on after being turned off as if you just turned a controller on, and this will happen repeatedly until the headset is turned off or drops connection.Everything noted here clearly explains the 3 star review, which can be improved upon greatly.Update 4 months after purchase;I've reduced my rating to a one star simply because I've lost too many competitive matches because of difficulty in communication with teammates due to my headset audio cutting out, staticy mic output, or dropping connection/randomly turning off by itself. This is completely unacceptable performance for such a price and makes me less inclined to purchase another set of supposedly top rated wireless headphones period, regardless of brand.",
          "These headphones could be awesome, but they missed the mark badly on basic functionality. My biggest problem with these I have is connecting to group chat and I can hear everyone, but no one can hear me. This happens the majority of the time, and I usually have to disconnect headphones and reconnect them and hope it works. Its rather embarrassing when your friend all have the cheapie headphones and they connect with ease and can hear each other fine. The next biggest problem is charging. For some reason they can be connected to xbox all night with xbox on, but when I goto use them they don't turn on. I have to plug them in and they I can turn them on. Sometimes I can disconnect the cord once I get them to turn on, but sometimes they appear to not be holding the charge. So at that point I end up using them with a cord connected for power. One of the major selling points was I wanted to have WIRELESS ( including power) headphones.Now with the bad things out the way, what I like about them. They sound really, really good. I hear sounds in games I never heard before, everyone hears me clearly ( when I do get them connected properly) and I can hear everyone. I like the controls to be able to lower game sounds and voices separately directly on the headset. My next big thing that I like about them, is they are comfortable. Usually, after a few hours full size headphones get heavy on my ears . Being female, with a smaller head and ears, this can get quite uncomfortable. These headphones I can wear for hours on long gaming sessions and no discomfort.  They also have a nice range I literally can walk around the house from one room to another and be in group chat and not break up. Nice when you need to run to kitchen and don't want to have to remove headset, and my kitchen is not close to my bedroom.Should you buy them? Hmm, if you don't use group chat as much as I do, you may not be as bothered by the issues with connecting to chat, but then you may still experience the power on issue. For this price point, it's hard to recommend headsets that have issues like this on a regular with basic functionality. I really hope they get a software upgrade at some point to fix these issues. When they work, they are the best gaming headphones for chat and gaming as far as how they sound that I've ever had. Being wireless is a huge plus ( when it works properly), most wireless suffer in sound quality, but these don't. Those are thing things that have kept me from sending them back. However, if I had to buy another set of upper end headphones I would probably try and another brand.",
          "Here is a honest review of this product and why you should avoid (or purchase)THE BADPoor/NO support support from Steelseries - This is why I wont purchase from the manufacturer again (You descide)Poor loudness (volume)Hardware is a little outdated (Build in 2019 so as of 2022 this is 3 years old out of the box)THE GOODComfortableGreat quality buildSound Quality is AWESOME (if you can hear it)Good battery lifeEarpiece is a little insulating and ears get hot of prolonged gamingPurchased the unit and out of the box the volume was slightly too loo on full volume. I followed the troubleshooting steps to update firmware and reset the headset to no avail.Next searched online (Google) and it appears as though I am not the only one with issue (Many Results found from others having the same issue).Here where the \"Support\" issue starts. There is NO WAY to chat or call support (For a high end unit that is not cheap this is very odd). I had to email tech support then wait (2) days to get an email with the following content:\"Thanks for the feedback! I'll be forwarding this feature request to our software team! :)\" - Case closedThey did not even try to resolve the issue.Next I went to Twitter @SteelSeries and posted my experience.Someone reached out to me and asked for the ticket # so they can investigate this for me.2 days later NO response. I replied to the tweet asking for an update and am still waiting for a response.Due to these issues I'm going to return the unit as I don't want to get stuck with it and can't fix it with the help of support.This product hardware / controls is Manufactured in 2019 so from the get go it's a little dated and not super intuitive.Let me explain the hardware and controls being out of date:First of all the wireless is using a dedicated 2.4 Ghz controller (Most newer headset use 5Ghz). This causes the range to be dismal, I'm talking 20-25 feet. Once you are out of range you will need to turn off the unit then turn it back on to get reconnected. Sounds simple enough but the controls are not well thought out for this task. Because the power button is not just for power you will need to press and hold for (3) seconds (any longer (6) seconds and you active the reconnect to XBox function or bluetooth), the hold it again for (3) seconds to turn it back on. This mean we you walk some 25 feet away you are stuck for around 20 seconds pushing buttons to get the headset reconnected (Not good mid-game).It is power via Micro USB (Has to plugin one way not either way like USB-C) which is a pain because it's connector is Black on the Black ear piece. Very hard to see especially in low light. Frequently I spend 2-3 minutes trying to get it plugged in to charge after a late night of gaming.Final Thoughts:If Steelseries had better support (or any support for that matter) (I'm 3-4 days in waiting for an answer) purchasing this Headset would be a NO BRAINER as the sound quality / build quality/ / Battery Life is as good if not better than many other units $100+ the price of this unit. However due to the lack of support (and trust me you don't need support until you do) is a DEAL BREAKER for me. I'm sad to say I'm going to return this unit and stay away from Steelseries products going forward. This does make me sad I had such high hopes for the Arctis 9X and all the reviews I read on many sites have this unit at the top of the reviews.Hope this review help you make the right choice for you and if you purchase one of these you are making a well informed descision.",
          "Received in May 2021what I consider being my first gaming headset. Since then I've gone back and forth from enjoying it to feeling like I wasted two hundred on an auditory illusion that at times is outperformed by a sixty-dollar Astro headset that I don't even consider to be for gaming. It definitely brought familiar areas in games to life in a way I never experienced before which is great but virtual surround sound is virtually useless without visual cues and map memorization. You can gain a competitive edge  it's just not as straightforward or effective as surround sound. Of course, that's with every headset. That aside, these sound great when gaming out of the box and can be adjusted using a PC. They're not loud and lack base but you can hear every little sound clearly. The design is light and comfortable to use. I'm surprised they dropped the ball using a micro USB port and a volume dial that goes from 0 to max from the slightest touch. I didn't think the port was that big of a deal when reading other reviews but it doesn't connect easily and if it breaks then it's game over and goodbye to my $200. The broken volume dial renders the headphone jack unusable. It feels like a cheap set you wouldn't spend $10 on. For the price, you'd think they'd be my go-to headphones for devices like my pricey mind machine but I'd much rather use cheap Astros or earbuds. Again, this is when using the jack.As for the dual-function Bluetooth/wifi, this headset's main selling point, the connection quality is hit or miss and I don't have anything to compare it to. The battery lasts forever. It has never failed me even when I forget to charge it. The dual function is great and if that's what you're looking for, idk of any other headset that has this feature at least at the time I purchased it. If you need it, this is a solid purchase. If you don't care then it's a hard sell and I wouldn't recommend any headset unless you must have one for practical reasons. Otherwise, as far as performance, you're much better off getting an actual surround sound system. I had a cheap Sony that didn't cost much more than these virtual surround headphones. If you live in an apartment, have roommates, kids, or whatever,  I get it. Just don't get caught up in the hype and think you're buying something comparable.I don't regret the purchase and have found many uses for it outside of gaming. If you play Destiny then you will probably understand when I say I hate these Steelseries, they're my favorite headphones.",
          "I owned this headset for 20 months, until it literally fell apart on me.  The major design flaw is how they connect the earpiece to the headband.  It's a very narrow connection and the head band and the earpieces have some heft to them.  Just the other day, I went to adjust my mixer and volume settings and I felt a crack near the dial on the left earpiece.  By the time the play session ended it suffered catastrophic failure and the earpiece was left dangling by a wire and was no longer wearable.  I have some other minor issues as well.  It seemed that the mixer and volume dials would constantly change between the end of one session and the beginning of another session.  I have no idea how that happened, but I always hung it up after a session.  It was a bit of a nuisance to have to keep adjusting it every time I started a session.  The other issue I had was with band not fitting snuggly, which would cause it to slide a lot on my head.  If I leaned forward or backward there was a chance of the entire headset falling off my head.  I had originally ordered this for use with my XBox One X and had no issues with setting it up, but when I went to transfer it to my XBox Series X I had a bit of difficulty linking the two devices.  I also rarely ran into issues with the headset turning itself off shortly after turning it on and needed to be turned on again.Some of the good was it was very comfortable.  I felt it breathed nice and was much cooler than other headsets I had purchased.  The cushion on the earpieces was made of a very nice material and doesn't erode and fall apart like other headsets that may use that pleather-like coating, making it all nasty.  I also liked the retractable mouthpiece and how it lit up on the tip when you had it on mute.I fully expected this headset to last way longer than 20 months and thought it would last at least 5 years.  I really wish I got the service plan, but that's just my luck, I guess.  If it wasn't for it falling apart all of a sudden within a couple years of purchase, I would have given this my strongest recommendation.  Alas, that didn't happen; and I'd only recommend buying this if you plan to get the service plan as well.",
          "This is a good headset, good bluetooth capabilities. The sound quality and the comfortability is the best part of this headset. The headset doesn't even feel like its on your head sometimes. Now.. for the eh parts of the headset. After 3 months of use the headset was showing some signs of wear which was daunting for an item that cost me 200$. A week after noticing the signs of wear the right side earphone muff thing broke off completely. I contacted amazon and they told me to talk to steel series themselves, I did and they were noooo help but, amazon said if they didn't help me that they would. Amazon replaced my headset and made me feel heard. Amazon is a great company and I will always choose Amazon when doing online orders.  The headset they gave me to replace the broken one has been going strong for almost half a year now. Doubt I received a dud as I've seen that this is a recurring issue with other consumers of this product. Overall 4/5 only because Amazon saved the day. IF the headset didn't break the first time this would be a 5/5.",
          "I wanted a major headset upgrade and decided that I wanted to go wireless. I've been surfing multiple websites and this headset has been mentioned frequently as one of the best in Xbox wireless headsets. With me wondering if I made the right choice, I placed my order and was eager waiting for the headset to arrive.My first impression was that the headset is really nice and minimal, with the only contrast being the black-green pattern band. I took the band off as I have an afro and it fits me well.I really liked how they nailed some of the features of this headset, like the game/chat wheel, the red LED for a muted mic, and the bluetooth function. The bluetooth function is what won me over and it's integrated very well! I was rock solid on this headset and felt like I really made the right choice.............that's until I experienced the static and audio drops that this headset is criticized for. I didn't really mind it at first, but all of that changed when I walked out of my room. The headset drops audio almost immediately and if I don't come back in range after a certain period, then it fails to reconnect at all and I have to turn the headset all the way off and then back on. In my case, what use is a wireless headset for if I can't walk out of my room with it?This was a major dealbreaker for me. This was my first time with a SteelSeries product and I was beyond disappointed, and was getting ready to return the headset the next day. In my mind, this headset nailed everything but its core feature and was really sad that I was going to return it.BUT THAT'S UNTIL I decided to swap over from my original Xbox One to the Xbox Series X. I originally bought the xsx for my room but then I gave it to my brother to keep for himself and now waiting for another to ship to me. Before I went with returning the headset, I grabbed the xsx and put it back in my room so if anything improved, it would be in my controlled environment (I also run the Xbox One as mentioned, along with monitors, a desktop computer, and various smart home devices in my small room).I paired the headset with the series X, hopped in a party, and well... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! My friends mentioned that my mic quality was better, and I can walk around and out my room with no connection drops. Hell, I was able to walk around a whole 2 story house with little distortion and no audio drops from my party. Much, much, much better range when connected to the Xbox Series X instead of the Xbox One.I was so happy that I now have a headset that fulfills all my needs and even exceeds in some ways. 2 things I wish this headset had was USB-C and a foam piece for the mic, but that can be bought for cheap. A tip is that if you are going to rock this headset, also buy a \"micro USB magnetic charger\" for convenient snap-on charging.Definitely recommend this headset to current and future Series X|S owners.",
          "The SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless Gaming Headset stands out with its sleek design and stellar audio performance. Its intuitive button layout allows for easy access while wearing the headset. Additionally, its ability to pair with both an Xbox and phone simultaneously is a major convenience factor for gamers. I personally like to listen to music on my phone and still hear the game audio. This headset can do that. The high-quality audio drivers and DTS Headphone:X 2.0 surround sound create an immersive audio experience that lasts up to 20 hours on a single charge, making the Arctis 9X an excellent choice for gamers who value audio performance and convenience.",
          "Bought a pair of the original 7x a while back and returned them almost immediately. They were very comfortable but sounded just ok, felt flimsy, and showed wear very quickly. Tried several other brands, ultimately settling on the Lucid LS50x, and have happily used those for a few years.Bought these after reading the rave reviews about the new Nova Pros and finding them a bit expensive for my use (Xbox only), and man what a difference. The sound quality and directionality are night and day better than the Lucids, which were on par with the original 7x and every other Xbox headset I've tried, and the build quality is fantastic.Extremely comfortable, very solid, compact enough that the cans don't bump the headrest on my gaming chair every time I move, and so light it makes me realize how much neck/head fatigue my old set was causing. Just wouldn't want to walk around with them much since the strap design is more geared towards prolonged comfort than a secure fit.Hands down the best Xbox headset to date.",
          "My chief concerns when ordering a headset was the fit and comfort. I often wear glasses when gaming so that was one concern over the ears, I also have what I\u2019d consider a big head. I\u2019m very happy to report that they fit with room to spare, and are VERY comfortable.Now to the function. Initial setup/connecting to a console were a breeze. It syncs to your console (Series X in my case) just like a controller. I like the controls for volume and mic controls on the headset, you can easily use all of them without needing to look at them. The sound quality feels immersive, I can easily hear sound from multiple directions in FPS games.You can simultaneously sync to your phone while connected to the console. It works very well for listening to music or messing around on your phone if you\u2019re in a loading screen. And yes, you can make phone calls. The person I called said the mic was crisp and clear.Cons - I\u2019m nervous about the long term health of the charging port. I think if you treat it nicely that you should be fine, and the long battery life should minimize needing to use it. It also comes with an Aux port if you want to be wired.In about 20 hours of gameplay, I have had ONE disconnection, and it reconnected after turning it off/on. I also experienced an odd problem where the console was loosing sync with the controller and I could only resync after doing a full system shutdown. This only started after I got the headset so I believe it was connected. I fixed the issue by disabling the instant on feature of the Xbox, which in the case of the Series X hardly makes a difference as it starts within seconds.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased. I cannot understate the comfort enough. At no point have I felt like they\u2019ve become uncomfortable. Build quality feels rock solid. Even with the occasional connectivity quirks, I\u2019d still recommend them.",
          "I've owned the Arctis 9X headset for about 4 months.  Recently, the right speaker started cutting in and out.  Then finally it completely stopped working.  After I bit of troubleshooting, I am fairly certain that the solder connection on the PBC from the master volume knob to the right speaker had failed.I'm not too happy with the return process.  First, I'd like to say that the support person that I emailed back and forth with was very nice and did her job well.  That being said, the actual policy for replacing headsets that fail due to a hardware failure is lackluster.After going through the support process, I was told that they would give me a voucher to purchase I like-for-like replacement from their web store.  Great!  Except, they are currently out of stock on the webs store.This is NOT the most customer centric process.  Thankfully, I still have my Turtle Beach headset, which I love but disconnects more frequently than the Arctis. (See \"CONNECTIVITY\" below).  But if I didn't have the backup headset, I'd be forced to be without a headset until they decide to restock the web store.  Or go buy something to get me by.  I was told they should have them back in stock in 2-3 weeks.  Not cool.As far as the headset itself.SOUND: They sound great.  Clear, crisp and loud enough.  They sound just as good, if not better than the Turtle Beach headsets.MIC: It's not the greatest.  The claim that SteelSeries makes regarding the mic being the same technology as used on aircraft carries is. . . . . accurate?  But I don't think that's something to be boasting about.  I literally sound like an airline pilot making an announcement over the intercom.NOISE CANCELING: As far as noise canceling goes. . . there doesn't seem to be any.  It picks up EVERY room noise.  Every shift or slight movement of the headset.  If I take a drink unmuted, by buddy asks me if I'm ok because he says it sounds like I'm drowning.OVERALL DESIGN: They look good.  I'm not a fan of the retractable mic.  Or having the mute button on the back of the right ear cup.  I miss being able to flip my mic up to mute.  I'm on the fence with the dedicated \"master volume\" and game/chat mix dials.  For one, I'll often accidentally bump the dials when I put the headset on or take it off.  And in my case, it's another point of failure vs. just having the game/chat mix dial.  They are heavier than my Turtle Beach headset, but are still comfortable.  Even after hours long gaming sessions.BATTERY LIFE:  Battery lasts a really long time.  There are some weekend where I might have the headset on for 8+ hours straight and I've never had an issue with running out of juice.CONNECTIVITY: If you're having issues with your current headset dropping connection often, these will not fix your issue.  As mentioned above, the don't drop quite as often or as hard as my Turtle Beach headset, but it still happens.  I'm pretty sure having my wireless router right next to my Xbox, is the source of my problem.Verdict:The failure of the headset after 4 months of use is frustrating.  But stuff happens.  It's inexcusable that they do not have stock on hand to honor warranty returns.  Because of that, I can't recommend.  I need to fix my wireless router interference issue and go back to using the Turtle Beach headsets.",
          "I\u2019ve bought two of these headsets for buddies on Xbox and to no surprise the both of them are also in love with them. Comfy head strap, great style and feeling to the ear cushions. Independent voice chat and content/game audio sliders. The microphone thankfully doesn\u2019t mute or shut off when you plug the headset in to charge mid use. (My friends and I had a different brand headset that would no longer transmit your microphone when it was being charged while using it. It was wireless only, even though it was usb it didn\u2019t want to allow you to use it wired so you were silenced for a little bit if your headset was dying.) Audio quality and direction is fantastic. One note I\u2019d like to point out is make sure you look at what direction the microphone is facing if your friends are having a hard time hearing you. One of the guys moves his arms a lot lol and the mic piece gets flipped and we can barely hear him when that happens. It\u2019s not crazy expensive nor very cheap but this is a true case of, you get what you pay for here. Quality worth every penny on that price tag, and an awesome day when on sale.If you have any problems: You can reach out about your order, it can be replaced by Amazon/Steel Series if necessary!Utilize your warranty! Pay close attention to the manufacture warranty because there are always bad apples for all companies and products. I have not ran into any bad products from Steel Series. But make sure to utilize the warranty if something is wrong with your product. For example if the sound is only coming out of one ear. If google says it\u2019s just a driver issue and the latest update for the headset does the job then awesome. If the \u201cfix\u201d requires you to get physical with the headset and take anything apart you could very easily break it which voids your warranty. I\u2019d much prefer warranty and get a new headset that actually works this time. You paid good money for something important, nice, and not exactly cheap, so you better get what you paid for and that warranty is part of that money, so use it!",
          "I purchased these despite the reported issues with connectivity. And I noticed when I purchased it I had no offer to add a protection plan. This was concerning.I received my headset and charged them, but they appeared fully charged. I then hooked them up to my laptop to adjust the settings and check for firmware updates. Surprisingly, there was no update and I appear to have the same version that has been out with reported issues.Knowing that I didn't want to use the Bluetooth feature and after reading about others experience. I decided to disable the Bluetooth auto connect feature in the steelseries engine.I synched my headset to my Xbox and viola! They certainly sound great. The volume isn't excessive, but that's probably for the best. They sound fantastic and I noticed directional audio was very good.After one match in the new COD MW. I was in the menu when I noticed the first sign of crackling.I grew concerned considering the price tag.But I continued. The crackling would occasionally occur, more commonly with the menu soundtrack.Then in game there were a few instances of the audio momentarily dropping.I was trying anything I could think to determine the cause. I tried turning off Bluetooth devices around me.It was then I notice it happens more when I move abruptly. This made me fear it was a hardware issue such as loose parts.After giving up to find the cause of the issue, I continued playing.At some point the headset disconnected entirely despite still being powered on. I was sure I was going to return them at this point.But I wanted to game. So after reading guidance I found online. I shut off the headset. Hard reset my console. And smoked a cigarette.Since I turned it on after this, I have had no issues. Even if I move my head more than I naturally would.Now this was about 18 hours ago. I'm about to use them again and hope there are no issues.If it's a firmware issue I don't mind waiting for an update. Because if I have no more issues, then the troubles I had in the first few hours after initially connecting no longer occur. Then these deserve 5 stars.I may update my review of anything changes. I bought them with confidence the connectivity issues have had ample time to be addressed and resolved. However I did have the same reported issues initially.If they don't have anymore connection issues, these are hands down 5 stars.This may be the most comfortable headset I have ever worn. And they sound great.For the price, I expect the quality. And if the connection issues persist then the headset is unbearable to use. I hope they last and I don't run into many more issues.I definitely recommend them. The only caveat is the present connection issues that commonly occur. If you get a pair, try what I did and troubleshoot. Because now that they have been working, I'm very happy with them. I'm hoping they continue to work well because it would be sad for such a great product to become useless due to one significant flaw.",
          "These where perfect when working, didn't have any connectivity issues like other people but you kinda want to treat these like wired headsets. Don't try to walk into another room real quick or they will disconnect and not reconnect for a long time unless you turn them on and off.Make sure the headsets have line of sight with the platform your using or it will immediately drop connection but that's minor, you won't be jogging around the house while gaming just would be nice if I could take a leak real quick and comeback without either taking them off first or turning then on and off because they disconnect because I went to the bathroom which is about 7 steps away from my Xbox.So I brought these and they lasted a year and just refused to turn on or charge. I hit up steel series.com and they pretty much said screw off so I will never by another one of there headsets again and that sucks but the steel series a super high quality.",
          "I've had all kinds of headphones for gaming over the years, Astro A40, Turtle Beach, Tritton, Razer, tried them all.  This is my first set of SteelSeries and a am impressed by far with the comfort.  The ear cups are like putting clouds on the side of your head the are so comfortable for wearing for hours at a time.  I though the ski goggle type band at the top was goofy but it's also so comfortable.  The Mic even is nice, depending on your preference you can pull it out a little bit or all the way out to your mouth and the red LED on it when you mute is bright and very obvious.The charging ports on these kinds of things always seem to be a generation behind and this is no different, there's a micro-usb port rather than a USBC type charging port.  But my older Turtles and Astros both use Mini-usb so it's at least a generation newer than those.The 100% cordless is amazing, i've lost a few headset chat cords to my dog that likes to nip at them when I'm gaming of it i take it off for various reasons that's what he grabs the little cord.  The 9X is completely wireless fixing all my doggo issues and it's just nice to have that freedom not having a cord going to the controller for chat.  Another great thing with the game audio being 100% wireless is it should move forward to Series X pretty well which will not have a fiber output jack on it making my older astros and older turtles seemingly useless on the upcoming new consoles.Wireless however has one downside, interference.  You may need to adjust the wifi channels that your router is using so that you get a clear channel for your 9x and then you won't get interference.  I'd already done that for my Astros and Turtles so they worked without interference and my 9x's work just as well zero interference and zero disconnects from xbox one x.The physical buttons are pretty minimal.  Pairing to the xbox the directions are wrong, you need to hold the pairing button in much longer than the manual states, until the LED blinks ONLY white, not blue and white.  At that point it'll pair with xbox.  Straight up wrong documentation on that.  But otherwise the buttons function well it's easy to hit the mute button, and the two volume knobs to adjust main volume and then chat/game mix volume work great.  It can also stream in bluetooth audio as well but i have not had a need to try that out.The battery is rated for 20 hours but I can't confirm or deny that claim, i tend to charge it every other day so it's got 8-10 hours on it before i charge it and that's been working great with zero low battery warnings.Overall, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this headset to anyone .  It's comfortable, it sounds great, lasts a long time and seemingly should have zero issues rolling forward into the next generation.",
          "These headphones are great enough that I'm overlooking the few negatives I have with them to give it a full five stars. I know a lot of people probably care about sound quality the most, and that is how I started my title, but I'm going to go with comfort first. I've worn these headphones upwards of 3 hours straight on a work call and barely even knew they were on my head. The adjustment strap is a little wonky and takes some getting used to, but it keeps the bulk of the headphones off your head, and the ear cups feel like cotton balls.Next, sound quality is out of this world. These sound better than my wired Sennheiser studio headphones. The mic quality, so far as I can tell, is great as well. I like being able to adjust the mic (my other headphones have a tiny mic hole built into one of the ear cups). And while I can oftentimes hear myself when I'm speaking (which is how I can tell the mic quality is en pointe), I don't hate hearing my voice like I would in other situations, like a recording of my voice.I also love that I can use the headphones (with mic) using a 3.5mm aux cable because my work computer has Bluetooth disabled, which I learned after buying these.Now for a shocker: I actually hate how the headphones adjust. I know, I know: I just said that helped make the headphones super comfy. Yes, that's true. But it's a springy strap with a hook-and-loop patch on one end: when the set is on my head, the strap wants to contract, making it tough to adjust. Then because I guess I have a smaller head, the two hook-and-loop patches don't meet, meaning there's a loose end of the strap that kinda flaps around. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.The other con is that these headphones are frustratingly difficult to connect over Bluetooth when multiple devices are paired. Even looking at the directions, I can't figure out what to push in what order to get them to switch, and I usually take a few minutes to get them to work on the computer I want to use them with. Frustrating, but I can live with it.",
          "Sounds fantastic, side tone/mic monitoring is probably the best I've experienced, works seamlessly with the Xbox Series X. Couple downsides (not dealbreakers for me): No mobile app, you can only edit settings using a PC and does NOT work on any Mac, Micro USB plug instead of USB-C.",
          "I bought this headset from son for Christmas a year ago. He has been using it every day. He loves his headset.",
          "Sounds is super clear, mic works great and batter life is impeccable",
          "First let me say these are comfortable. I'm sure your heard this already somewhere. The earcups are not sweaty and hot. Feel really good on the ears. The overall sound was just ok out of the box. The problem is you have to go to a PC everytime you wanna tweek the sound on these. It really needs an app. The balance in my set was not equal and no way of adjusting this. I returned these.",
          "It is very comfortable and fits my large head with a little room to spare. It has pretty good sound quality and I like the retractable mic. It\u2019s somewhat close in sound quality to my sennheiser I use for the tv. My one complaint is it doesn\u2019t have the boom I get in the sennheiser. When it comes to hearing everything around me, I hear it all.",
          "I like to think that when getting something with a high price tag that you're paying for both sound quality and durability. First few months with this headset was good to go and felt that I was getting my money's worth until it started rattling. The rattling would happen with some of the littlest movements and sometimes not at all. I had to spend money to buy a very specific screw driver just to get to the screws that held the speaker cover shut, remove the ear cup, unscrew to remove the plastic speaker cover to get to a chunk of plastic that snapped off and was rattling around. The plastic chunk was apparently a piece of the housing that was to help keep the metal (bracket? Bolt?) In place and to prevent from spinning around and twisting up wires. Less than three months later, another plastic chunk of the same area breaks off and now I have a loose ear cup that sits very uncomfortably on my ear that constantly needs to be readjusted and is so frustrating that I'm about ready to rip it apart.In short: I love the sound quality and ability to connect to my phone via Blu tooth but the durability and cheap plastic that supposed to hold it together will prevent me from getting this ever again.",
          "I've had 2 pairs of these over the last 2.25 years, the first one just straight up stopped working after about a year & 1 month, and the most recent one I've bought has lasted a year and 2 months but I can hear the left speaker starting to go in and out. It's not worth the price every year. Although I do admit, the sound is decent if you were immersed in gameplay and need to hear small details, but when you're in a party with other people that kind of goes away when you adjust the dial more than halfway between gaming and party chat. I also really enjoy the simultaneous dual connection between my Xbox and my phone, really useful for incoming calls and for music while gaming. Probably my favorite feature, but at this point it's not worth the $200 price tag. If they were to cut the price in half, I wouldn't mind paying $100 a year for yearly replacements, but I'm positive ya'll wouldn't \ud83d\ude02 so I do not reccomended these headphones if you want them to last more than a year and a half MAX.",
          "For a wireless headset that you are looking to only drop $100-300 on, this is the best I've tested. Turtle Beach Stealth Gen 2 came awfully close, but I felt the tuning on this was better, even after playing around with the settings. I did try the Nova Pro, but these are a bit more comfortable (breathable and no ANC bud touching your ear), and I could only recommend the Pro for only the looks or if you have multiple platforms you wish to hook up into the headset. Otherwise, for a console/PC use for wireless, this is hard to beat!",
          "I would be a bit less happy with these if I paid MSRP $200 instead of $55 open-box. No USB-C, and while the battery life is good they're slow to recharge. On one hand they're convenient with Xbox's proprietary connection tech, on the other hand if your console is in a bad location like inside a TV stand, they often lose connection. Because they also Bluetooth to your phone, when the Xbox connection is lost, the headphones are still on, and to reconnect you have to hold the power button to fully turn them off and back on again (takes like ten seconds). But the mic is great, the built in equalizer is a nice bonus (but you should still get the DTS:X app for $15 and select these 9X cans from their calibration system), the pads are pretty comfortable, they're overall light weight and good looking cans, and sound quality is good enough to use with music.",
          "If you want to use this on pc you can do it via Bluetooth but it's better to use an Xbox wireless adapter.",
          "Really can\u2019t beat up on these too much they are way less expensive than others. But I\u2019d definitely recommend buying others if you can afford to buy the PenroseX or a50 they have a price tag for a real reason in this category. The audio is okay and the volume isn\u2019t very loud. The mic is clear, but still too sensitive to background noise. Game and chat audio don\u2019t always mix correctly. For the price they are hands down better than anything as or less expensive(wireless)",
          "Out of the box most headphones sound horrible, that's no secret. Got these to replace my old Astro headsets I had for 5 years. Played with multiple different EQ profiles, YouTube videos, presets, external programs, Dolby Atmos, everything. Couldn't get rid of the hollow sound. Everything sounds like you are in a tin can. Ended up returning after configuring it for a day. Headphones were comfy and had no issues with connectivity at least.",
          "This headset is not as good as they say. I wanted a mid level back up headset to my Astro A50s and this wasn't it. I didn't expect top tier sound quality but I didn't even get mid level despite using the equalizer. I have used Plantronics RIGs that had better quality. As far as comfort, it misses it's mark. While the band fits nice on your head (with only 2 adjustable levels) the cups along with the noise canceling makes your head feels like it's swimming. With the mic passthrough turned all the way up it still wasn't good enough.The big thing for me was the speaker quality. They need to do better.",
          "Muy satisfecho con el producto recibido.",
          "I'll start off by saying this was a good headset while it lasted. It was comfortable to wear after breaking in, the ear pads didn't produce sweat, wasn't too tight either. The options to change the input and outputs on the PC app and carry over to Xbox was impressive. Sound in was pretty good, just without a good talk back mechanic. What was there for that feature needed to be turned on and even then it was faint.My biggest gripe would be the audio overflow it would seem to bug out. In a lot of cutscenes where maybe explosions would happen or even sometimes loading into a match, it would static out. Preventing you from talking or hearing, like you had a real bad connection to the console. Based off other reviews and other users I've talked to, its a hit or miss per person. Walking away from the console, even into just around the corner, would disconnect your headset and be difficult to reconnect and possibly just turn off. This is also just a problem with the Series X console, where the controller would do the same and possibly not reconnect even if powered on. The headset followed suit. This issue may have lead to the headset burning out. I disconnected the power from the console, turned it back on, turned on the headset afterwards. The headset beeped like it was powering up but never did. Following suit, it would not turn on again, nor charge on any cables. It wouldn't even connect hardwired to my console or PC. I believe the headset just short circuited somehow during its own boot up.*EDIT: changed score from 2-4 stars. The headset seemed to had hard locked itself in some bizarre fashion and just needed a press on the reset button. If anyone else has the same issue, it\u2019s under the ear cuff of the non mic side/ side with all the buttons and charger. Needs a paper clip to reach through the tiny hole.TLDR, Good headset if it stays in the same room as your device, but will still have connectivity issues during heavy audio loads on series x.",
          "I never buy anything electronic unless it's new but I took a chance and bought the steelseries arctis 9x like-new. It came in the original package and there is zero sign that it was ever used. Everything connected has it should, the bluetooth to my phone and the pairing with my xbox series x. I basically paid $74 for a brand new headset that cost up to $200 at times.",
          "BUYER BEWARE: DECENT PRODUCT BUT AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! BUY FROM ASTRO, TURTLE BEACH, LUICID SOUND, OR HYPER X INSTEAD! BETTER SOUND AND BUILD QUALITY USUALLY FOR LESS.  DONT BELIEVE THE SPONSORED \"BEST HEADSETS\" LISTS!First off, I NEVER take the time to write reviews. Also, I have purchased and used about every flagship wireless surround headset and several higher end wired from every major manufacturer for the past 6 years XBox One has been out.  I've purchased them for myself and my three children as well as given them to friends and family due to dissatisfaction for one reason or another.  I have owned the Stealth 500X, Stealth Elite 800X, Stealth 700X and the Wired Stealth 90Xfrom Turtle Beach, Wired Cloud Core X and Stinger 2 from Hyper X, Astro A40 and A50 (for both my PS4s and XBox Ones.) If you're wondering why so many, children break things and I usually play with the right earcup slightly offset to hear my family if they call or need something.  It typically causes some stress on the plastic frame swivel joints and usually the joint cracks after a year or so. Plus, I'm a technophile/audiophile and I have been chasing the high quality experience that I had with the original Turtle Beach Stealth 500X headset (which was discontinued or I would have bought another)Overall the product is admittedly good, I really liked the light weight and great sound.  Being able to connect to my Bluetooth phone, computer, or stereo on the fly was great.  Descent sound quality (a little more flat sounding music and ambiance than others I've used, but it picks up footsteps and game audio cues well) and compatible with Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos software which helps. Good mic quality too.HOWEVER, after a few months of regular use and good care the left ear driver stated intermittently going out.  I called customer service when it stopped working all together and they walked me through some troubleshooting and showed me how to do the factory reset using a paperclip to press the reset located in the ear piece.  This would take care of the problem for a while, but ultimately it ended up failing and refused to come back on.  I was still well within the year warranty so I contacted customer service again and told them what was going on.  They informed me that they couldn't verify my purchase because I bought it through a third party retailer (Amazon) so I need to pursue a return though Amazon first.  Amazon stated that it wasn't covered in the A-Z policy and it was outside the window for returns. Plus, because it was an accessory that was worn and an electronic, they couldn't give me and exchange or even a partial refund credit.So when I contacted SteelSeries again, they had me take a bunch of photos and send an invoice from Amazon, which I did a few different times and they kept telling me it wasn't an official invoice screenshot, (it was a receipt, a purchase confirmation, and a shipment and delivery confirmation email and screenshot for each respective time. All of which had the order number, tracking number and my personal information and address.) So I finally asked them to  walk me through which specific invoice I had to generate from Amazon and where to obtain it.  Finally, they told me they still couldn't confirm the legitimacy of my purchase and warranty status despite the specified documentation and photographs including the serial number and condition of the headset they had asked for. So they told me to send the product in (which I had to pay for postage on and shipped 2-day priority) after a week I was notified that the battery was dead (no kidding the headset wasn't working at all on one side and I had been using a backup) but stated that nothing was wrong and I just needed to charge it.  I got it back and the headset still didn't work on the left side and wasn't wanting to stay on now and kept disconnecting.  (Despite having a full overnight charge). The headset also came back with a HORRIBLE stale, sour, body odor smell, which they basically called me a liar about.  I had specifically cleaned the ear cushions and let them dry completely) before shipping because I figured someone would be having to put it on. Plus, I always kept my headset on a stand and wiped it down after playing as I'm a bit of a clean freak.  I knew it was B.S. and it upset me that they kept telling me the headset was fine and that there was no odor.They finally told me I could send it back (Again, my cost) so I sent it as is to prove the odor existed and told them I was doing so. Once again told me that nothing was wrong.  They kept indirectly insinuating that I was a liar or just trying to get over on them and get a new headset. Then told me that the headset was stinking when they received it and basically suggested that it was due to my personal hygiene.I would think that SteelSeries wouldn't appreciate a few lazy or dirtbag employees ruining their brand's reputation by being rude or discourteous to customers, but it sure as hell happened.  I don't think they ever tested the headset properly or at all.  The fact that they didn't help at all, called me a liar, and I was left with a stinking broken headset now outside the warranty window and I guess I'm blacklisted because they won't return my messages, despite being polite in my correspondence and always thanking them when they helped remotely.Pretty good headset for the six-months or so it lasts, but absolutely shit-tier customer service that only calls you a liar and refuses to even give you an opportunity to pay for a repair or even give a discount or credit towards a replacement.",
          "After using these for about a month now I can say this really is a great headset. I used to be a loyal Turtle Beach customer, 3 headsets in a row over more than a decade, but since they haven\u2019t released a new flagship in awhile, I decided to finally give the competition a try.For starters the construction is great as you should expect from a $150+ pair of headphones. I\u2019ve always been wary of the dual band (solid segment and adjustable strap or part) because it essentially makes 2 points of failure in addition to possible balance issues but thankfully, the 9X has a metal support band and it feels fantastic. It keeps it centered where you place it on your head very well and should last much longer than a plastic band. The strap surpassed my expectations. It is easily adjustable and the flexibility feels like it was made specifically for putting something on your head, not to mention it is soft and doesn\u2019t cause chafing at all. The earcups are essentially monolithic solid pieces. The only piece that is a worry for failure, especially from fatigue, is the connection between the earcups and the band. It is just a single piece of curved plastic and not all that thick. Its connection points between the band and earcups seem to be metal standoffs or similar (bearings and whatnot) so that should be okay (it's the general design SteelSeries has been using for a long time so I assume it works). They hopefully shouldn\u2019t be all that load bearing but it is the only segment I would improve in the design. The volume scroll wheels feel good, not too loose not too stiff.I was impressed with the comfort of these. I have glasses and have 0 issues whatsoever. In fact, I would say if you are WORRIED about the comfort with glasses with headsets I might point you towards these specifically for that itself. The cushions feel nice and are more breathable than I expected. There has been one heck of a heat wave recently so I\u2019ve been gaming in 80+ degrees inside and haven\u2019t experienced any sweating issues (I don\u2019t sweat all that much in general however). The distance from the cushions to the speakers is not that deep, if you have ears that stick out farther than average you may find yourself rubbing the inside. The squeeze on the head isn\u2019t much, I saw some reviews spitting out values but it doesn\u2019t mean anything till you try. Playing for hours on end I haven\u2019t had any soreness, pain, etc. from the pressure but I am extremely used to wearing headphones so it may just be me. The cushions do help though, no hotspots or pressure points. The moveability of the earcups with the help of the strap should allow basically anyone to find a comfortable position with this headset.On to sound. I\u2019m not much of an audiophile and haven\u2019t 100% tested these to every sound degree but I can agree with some online reviews that they aren\u2019t the best for listening to music. It seems like the mixing is very tailored to games. It doesn\u2019t sound bad by any means but the default sound presets (flat, bass boost, smiley, focus) do not bring out anything music wise and I find myself using \u201cflat\u201d almost exclusively since it provides the best range imo. In-game I find no issues: they do their job, have good surround, and catch everything happening but I personally can\u2019t find much difference between these and my old Turtle Beach XO 7 pro (rip old friend) aside from maybe very minor frequency equalization. In the SteelSeries pc download you can adjust very little to actually mix the headset yourself so it is mostly what you get at the start. The volume adjust (and speech vs in-game) provides enough to find the level you want. It had noise canceling I believe and there's no option to turn it off but I think it mitigates decently enough, I\u2019m no longer in a louder environment so it is hard for me to tell.I\u2019d say this is a very ergonomic headset to wear: the retractable mic is a lot cooler and better than I expected, I\u2019ve said previously you can easily get it to sit comfortably on your head, and the buttons are spread out and feel different enough to find everything quickly and easily. Connecting to both an Xbox and PC or phone are easy as heck and it is incredibly cool you can do both at once. It definitely provides an avenue to play cross-plat games with people in a discord. The microphone is clear and sounds great. The battery life is phenomenal (and one of the main reasons I chose this over the Turtle Beach Stealth 700). Right out of the box it lasted me the whole week, at least 20 hours. I have been charging it once a week since, with the charge time being fast enough to take a break, watch some shows or something, and you\u2019re good to go.Okay, everything sounds great so far but, headsets are VERY unique per person and I do have quite a few gripes. It has been said before that it takes like 6-7 seconds to turn them on and yeah, it does. No reason for it to be more than 2-3 seconds to hold that dumb power button. I\u2019ve experienced a few instances where I turn them on, they connect, and then they turn off again within a second or two. Really weird but it has never happened in-game or anything. It may be some sequencing thing with my xbox and controller, I dunno, but it has happened more than I would like. The mic is INCREDIBLY sensitive, be wary. I never, ever, ever, have had a problem with my headsets picking up my fans before but now I do, it was so bad I almost returned them instantly. I went into the SteelSeries Engine and there is a mic volume option which I turned down to the minimum. It mitigated it enough to where I can use them and even when it does \u201cpick\u201d it up, I think it doesn't really register any sound now. I had to adjust my overall setup to accommodate for this and it now can pick up me just walking around due to the air moving, a bit of an issue since I like to pace. This caused me to sound fairly quiet in chat though so I had to move the mic closer to my mouth than I used to. I think it would do SteelSeries good to have a foam tip or some other method to prevent air/fan issues and general noise damping. Having the buttons and scroll wheels on the back of the earcups sounds like a good idea in principle, easy to reach, out of the way, etc. but on these they are so spread out and the scroll wheels are almost exactly where you put your hands when grabbing the headset to pick up and put down that you need to be careful not to touch them, else you have to change your volume back every single time you use them. Just a nitpick I know, I plan on getting a vertical stand for these so I don't lay the headset down on its side for this reason too. The little booklet they include is basically as minimal as you can get. The look is pretty basic, it was probably what they were going for but if the strap didn\u2019t have the green X flair it would look like a generic solid matte black headset. I like a bit of spice, some highlights here and there ya know, nothing too much but something subtle would be nice. I\u2019m not a super serious sound mixing studio enthusiast needing to be professional but I\u2019m also not some RGB psycho, everyone's tastes are different.All in all, this is a really good gaming headset. It\u2019s hard NOT to recommend. I definitely endorse spending the extra money to get a headset at least in the $100+ range as the difference between a $50-70 and an $100-150 is night and day. At the end of the day, you simply have to test things like this out to see if it works for you. I truly, almost returned it due to the mic issue alone (I literally activated the return but fiddled with it until I got it usable) but after using it for a month now, I do enjoy it. There\u2019s a lot of options out there and trying everything would take not only a lot of $$$ but a lot of time too, something not many of us have, so if I can find something that I can get to at least WORK, I am usually content",
          "Buckle up! it going to be a bumpy ride, but if you're looking for the perfect pair of headphones (under $200)... I can't give you a great answer because they dont exist. I can tell you however one of the two best that have ALMOST everything with VERY FEW compromises.To start, I'll explain my methods and what I was looking for. I used Rtings.com scores as the basis for what to try based on sounds and features. I have some very specific deal-breakers and absolute requirements. Hopefully my analysis will help you make your own decisions.First an important point that not everyone may have known. Bluetooth wireless has gotten very good, especially with advanced codecs like aptX. It can sound really good if you have a phone or device AND headphones that support it, but it deafults to crappier sound if one of them does not, and will always have a significant delay (200-400ms). This PROBABLY IS enough to notice when watching a movie, but YMMV. I've made the assumption that this is not good enough and was trying to find one with non-BT wireless which is \"lossless\" (perfect quality and undetectable lag). BT and non-BT wireless both use the 2.4 MHz spectrum (along with lots of other things like WiFi) but \"non-BT\" wireless is kind of a vague term that is supposed to mean VERY high quality or \"loss-less\" audio and low latency (compared to BT). However, every manufacturer seems to have their own version of the technology and there is at least on example of non-BT wireless that has terrible latency (Jabra). I think it is almost a typo because it basically has the latencey of BT, so I think they might actually jsut be implementing a proprietary version of it rather than HQ/lossless wireless transmission.So let's breakdown all of my must-have features:1. They must be able to be used while charging (it's crazy to me that any pair would not have this, but it's more commmon than you'd think and you can filter for it on RTINGS). A great battery can compensate for this, but the only thing worse than running out of battery is being completely incapable of using them while they charge. I want this for conference calling and if you dont have this, you're literally cut off from communicating until they recharge.2. They must have \"passive playback\" meaning you can use them with a standard headphone cable while they're turned off (or with a dead battery). This may not be essential to many, especially since many phones have gotten rid of the headphone jack, but I consider is a deal-breaker.3. It must have \"good\" wireless. I started out thinking I NEEDED NON-Bluetooth wireless as a feature, but I had to ditch that because there are only THREE MODELS (out of the 547 evaluated on Rtings.com) that have #1 and 2, and also both bluetooth and non-bluetooth wireless.4. Audio recording quality is also essential since I'm using these for zoom calls all day (and gaming, thus why I wanted non-BT wireless for better latency). I'm not picky about having a boom mic, but it has to have a good quality mic. This is subjective, but it sems like this means a score of >6-6.5 (they have actual sample recordings on Rtings) and I found that a score of 5.7 sounded awful, but 6.7 was plenty good.5. I'd really like to have ACTIVE noise cancelling (ANC) but it isn't a dealbreaker. I especially want this if I'm going to spend >200. I want this in general for travel because if I'm going to spend this much, I'd like to be able to use them everywhere.So, with criteria 1-4, there were 3 remaining models (#4 recording quality didn't actually filter any out). I've listed them below with the major drawback that has made me reconsider my search:Jabra Evolve2 - $350, but non-BT wireless latency is terrible, it's basically just proprietary BT and thus the latency, but it cant technically be called BTSteelSeries Arctis 9 or 9x - $200, but no active noise cancelling, terrible non-BT wireless qualityArctis Pro - $350, but no ANCThe Evolve2 are the ones that seemed to have the proprietary non-BT wireless, which explains it's terrible latency and I'm not willing to spend that much for something that doesn't have loss-less audio. I did not buy these to try, but did buy the \"elite 85h\" because I assumed that they would share the wireless connectivity latency problem.The Jabra elite 85h are a really good pair, a little pricier at $250, but the crappy lag on the non-BT wireless was immediately evident and was reason I eliminated them. They were able to connect to both my pc and phone well, but while using the microphone for any reason, there was a loud audible hiss present. I think this may have been \"side-tone\" which is where it plays back the mirophone input so you can hear yourself when you speak, but I could not hear much of myself, and it was a hiss at ~20 volume which was simply unusable (loud enough that I couldn't hear my zoom participants well...) This actually does NOT have passive playback (via headphone cord with no battery/power) and this discovery is the reason I added this criteria.The Steelseries 9x were absolutely terrific...SOME of the time. Using the wireless on anything but an xbox requires a microsoft xbox wireless adapter, but I had frewquent intermittant problems (that are all over the internet and have not been resolved as of 2020). I consider the non-BT wireless problems to be an actual defect and eventually returned them because of the weird noises that were basically nonstop. Despite this, and despite the lack of ANC, the BT and overall quality was stellar. I tried it on many different windows computers and nothing solved it.I actually ended up keeping the Steelseries 9 (not 9X) which amazon does not sell, and I had to get directly from the manufacturer. They are my daily home pair, they work great, and are SUPER comfortable. The BT is surprisingly worse than the 9 and I cant imagine why it would be any different, but it is. Still all-around the bestI decided not to even try the arctis pro because they were so expensive, but also because of the hub that it uses. I believe the hub is only necessary for the non-BT wireless, but I'm also just not willing to pay that much for a pair without ANC.JBL Quantum 800 - $200, this is a great pair that has almost everything, but not quite. The BT and non-BT wireless audio quality was great and the recording quality was great (boom mic). However, the battery life is almost insufferably bad, and, to add insult to injury, they cannot be used while charging. This was actually the second pair that that I bought, and is the reason I added criteria #1. They were also not very comfortable, but not the worst (none can compete with the comfort of the Steelseries). One wierd issues that may be present in other devices (but not the 9x) is that when the headset is turned off, the device in windows does not deactivate, meaning windows still keep playing audio on the non-existant device rather than switch to your next default. This means you have to manually select a different audio source when you turn them off.My final pick was the Seinhausser PXC 550-II. While these also do not have non-BT wireless connectivity, they have great BT wireless (AptX, low laency) and all the other features I wanted: great sound, great microphone, great battery, great ANC, passive playback, playback while charging (and can actually play directly over USB). The only slight negatives are the touch controls (intuitive, but easy to hang up on people if you stretch your arms in the air) comfort (again, cant compete with steelseries) and bluetooth connectivity. It says it can connect to two devices at once, and while this is true, you basically need to disable your phone or pc bluetooth to get it to work right. This took me the longest time to figure out, but it works great now.If I had to pick one pair now, it would be the Seinhausser pair. They have it all: great for travel, great battery, great sound, great mic, great battery/charging, good comfort, everything.The next best are the steelseries 9, which are better in some ways (comfort, non-BT wireless, chatmix, boom mic) but canty compete with the 30hour battery, ANC, and portability of the Seinhausser pair.",
          "Have had for a few months as my main gaming headset and everything either works perfect or won't connect. Through some research I eventually moved everything to 5g and power cycle our modem/ router which seems to fix the connection issues. We have 3 xboxs in the house and have only had issues on 3 occasions since initially setting up. Audio is great, mic is decent and headset is lightweight",
          "I purchased the SteelSeries Arctis 9X to replace a Razer Chimaera 5.1 that I had been gifted in the XBox 360 days and continued to use with my XBox One for several years. Much of this review will be a comparison with my older Razer Chimaera 5.1.The sound quality of the SteelSeries Arctis 9X was immediately noticeable as an improvement over the Razer. The Razer has a very hyped sound--over-accentuated low and high frequencies with a terrible weak mid-range. The SteelSeries Arctis 9X is flatter and more accurate across the range of frequencies compared to the Razer, and offers a bit more detail too. BUT, if I compare both or either of them to a pair of $80 Grado SR60e headphones (granted, those are wired, and have no mic), neither of the gaming headphones sound very good. The less-expensive Grados are head-and-shoulders better sounding, with much better detail and articulation than either SteelSeries or Razer 'phones.Still, since the SteelSeries sound noticeably better than the Razer Chimaera 5.1s, I count this as a win.The comfort of the SteelSeries Arctis 9Xs is quite good. The ear cups are comfortably padded to fit around the ear, and there is a cloth strip that the headband rides on, cushioning the top of your head as well. (Arctis calls it the \"Ski Goggle Headband\", for reasons that escape me.) The downside of this cloth strip is that it makes the SteelSeries 'phones a bit easy to pivot off the back of your head, for example when you lay down on the couch while gaming.They are more comfortable than the Razers, so this is another win for the Arctis 9X.The controls for the SteelSeries Arctis 9X are good. The power button to turn it on and off feels different (it's convex) than the Bluetooth button (which is concave). That's good, because you don't want to always take the headphones off of your head to look at the controls. Also, controlling volume is done with a real trimpot, not an up and down button like the Razer. That's good too--trimpots can be changed at whatever speed you want with instant feedback, not laboriously by repeatedly clicking a button up or down.Another win for the SteelSeries.The Razer Chimaera's base station/stand/charger plugs into the optical output of the XBox 360 or XBox One, and as soon as you turn things on the headphones are receiving sound. That's easy. With the SteelSeries Arctis 9X, you have to pair the headphones with the XBox One. Arctis advertises this as a superior method--for example their website for the 9X has as it's very first bullet point, \"Integrated Xbox Wireless means no cables or dongle required - connects just like a controller\u2028\". In practice, at least in my opinion, pairing is an extra step that gives no advantage. It's not awful, but I preferred the Razer's always-working audio. In this comparison, I give the point to the Razer, but it's a small point. The SteelSeries pairing worked well, and although it's an extra step it is not a hard step.And now we come to the place in the review when the SteelSeries Arctis 9X's real weakness appears. Charging. This is a big annoyance.When I was done with the Razer Chimaera 5.1 headphones, I would put them back on their stand. Contacts in the stand connect with contacts in the headband of the Razer headphones, and the headphones would charge. This is easy, and works very well. It's easy to do, even late at night.In contrast, when I'm done with the SteelSeries Arctis 9X headphones, there is no stand. There is no automatic charging. The solution offered by SteelSeries to charge these headphones is a mini-USB jack. Stupid. Fiddly. Not even a USB-C jack, which would still be fiddly but at least it doesn't care which direction you plug it in. Nope, none of that easy plugging in! Stupid stupid mini-USB.This is a big loss for the SteelSeries 9X. Charging is stupid and painful.To improve the situation a little bit I bought a stand that offered USB ports in the base. Specifically, I bought this stand:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779V6BC4/It's alright. But even with a stand and handy nearby USB ports, charging up the 9X is far inferior to the Razer Chimaera.In summary, the SteelSeries Arctis 9X headphones are pretty good. They improve in a lot of ways over my previous set of headphones. But it's a three steps forward, one step back kind of situation, and I really dislike the way you have to charge them.",
          "Great headset for long hour gaming and very comfy all day long, only issue I have with the headset; can hear my ceiling fan in my room (static noise) and people in game chat be like oh you have a shitty mic etc. That\u2019s way too sensitive. I have the Xbox series x so can\u2019t use software gg. Xbox chats are ok but it\u2019s only call of duty I\u2019m having a issue with.For the best Xbox headset I really didn\u2019t think I would have this issue. I\u2019m prob going try turtle beach 700 max.",
          "Worth your money",
          "I\u2019ve been using these for a total of about 40 hours now and I have had an overall positive experience.To start I have not experienced any of the connection issues expressed by other reviewers. That\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t have those issues they could have had a bad unit or some software updates could have gone through to help. If I do start to experience them I will update this review. Connecting to the Xbox was quick and easy and it connects right away every time I power them on.Having the ability to do Bluetooth while using Xbox wireless is a great feature. I love relaxing with some Minecraft and playing my own music via Bluetooth to the headset and having the audio mixed well together is great. I briefly used them as standalone Bluetooth headphones and they worked and sounded well.My teammates have no complaints over the mic quality. They didn\u2019t rave about it or anything they basically just said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d. The mute button is easy to find and the mic has a nice bright red light to let you know it\u2019s muted. One complaint with the mic is I wish it muted itself when you retracted it back into the headphones but the only way to mute is with the button. I\u2019m not a big fan of the retracting mic, I prefer flip up to mute style. Although if you intend to wear them out as Bluetooth headphones the retracting mic looks better.The comfort is my favorite feature of steel series headsets. The ski band head band is very comfy and I love the ear cup material. No issues wearing them for 5 hours straight.Audio quality is great. I\u2019m no audiophile but I was hearing details and footsteps that I wasn\u2019t hearing with my sennheisers. The EQ feature is a nice bonus. They also get very loud to the point where I never run them at full volume.Battery life is fine, unless you are playing for crazy 20 hour marathons just remember to plug them in when you are done and you won\u2019t have to worry about running out.Overall I would recommend this headset and I think it\u2019s worth the price. The quality concerns expressed by other reviewers left me hesitant but amazon has a great return policy if I got a dud. The comfort, sound quality and ability to do Bluetooth and Xbox wireless at the same time really make these a winner for me. Hopefully I won\u2019t need to update my review in the future.",
          "These are great if you're looking for headphones that have simultaneous audio for multiple devices. I've always looked down on \"gaming\" branded products as they tend to have a reputation for poor quality compared to regular products. This seems to be one of the exceptions. Basically if you're in a typical home environment without a need for noise cancellation and you want to keep headphones on all day, then you probably want these.SIMULTANEOUS SOUNDThese are some of the only wireless headphones that offer simultaneous sound because it does it through 2 sources - wireless and bluetooth. I briefly considered the high-end Sony and Bose headphones but discarded those options because despite marketed as multi-point, you still need to disconnect and reconnect every single time. I had to do that with my Jabras and Bose Quietcomforts and the hassle made it near unusable. These Nova 7x headphones are able to relay the sound from two simultaneous sources (one wireless, one bluetooth), which allows me to keep my headphones on for both my main entertainment devices without touching any settings.LATENCYI don't game much, but when I do, these produced some of the lowest latencies according to rtings. They are gaming headphones, after all.RANGEYou'll need to connect the receiver to the included USB-A extender because the interference from your device will reduce the range dramatically, but once it's connected, just move the receiver away from the PC. I'm able to receive audio from several rooms away through several walls by doing so. The bluetooth range is higher than my Bose Quietcomfort 2s.COMFORTBecause I wear my headphones for long periods at a time, comfort is a big deal to me. I bought the Bose Quietcomforts for that reason as it's regarded as the most comfortable pair of headphones on the market. However, what I realized after wearing different headphones over the years is comfort issues largely stem from the earpads. Shallow earpads will sometimes make the components inside the headphones poke at your ears causing pain. This is easily fixed with 3rd-party earpads, so I'd recommend against buying any headphones for comfort reasons alone. A second, more minor contributor to comfort is the degree to which the strap squeezes on your head. There's a tradeoff here - cheaper materials are flimsy and don't squeeze very strong, so they fall off your head easily but feel more comfortable than higher quality materials. Here, the 7x made a compromise - the top band is a fabric hammock that rests on your head, so it's simultaneously more comfortable than hard plastic while keeping the build quality reasonable. All in all, these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned - moreso than the Bose Quietcomforts - after replacing the earpads with thicker 3rd-party ones.ALTERNATIVESSonys, Razers, Bose, etc. Noise-canceling headphones: if noise cancellation is your top priority, then I'd go with a noise-cancelling pair of headphones. However, it will come with severe drawbacks. For instance, one common use of noise cancellation is on airplanes, but you need a wired connection to connect to the airplane entertainment system. Most headphones' noise cancellation features are disabled if a wired connection is used, and some headphones don't even have a wired connection option at all. Some do, but the implementation is so utterly awful that it might as well not exist (e.g., Arctis Nova Pro). Most of the time, if you're at home, there's not enough noise for noise cancellation to matter, and if there is, then you might not even want noise cancellation (e.g., if somebody is calling for you - you need to hear them). Similarly, if you're on public transportation or walking around the streets, noise cancellation will end up posing a safety risk if you can't hear important noises around you.Wired headphones: no matter how much reviewers rave about sound quality, there's no comparison to a decent pair of wired headphones. If sound quality is the only thing you care about, then pick up a pair of wired headphones and call it a day. For me, the convenience of simultaneous sound and wireless freedom beats out the additional sound quality, but to be honest, I have a pair of $40 wired headphones that sound better than the $400 Bose and Sony bluetooth pairs I've used in the past. Wireless is not where sound quality's at.Special mention: Arctis Nova Pro. These are marketed as an upgrade to the Nova 7x but are simply inferior. Based on the RTings sound reproduction breakdown, as long as you get a good fit on your head, which you will if you get 3rd party earpads, the Nova 7x produces similar if not better sound than the Nova Pro for about half the price. The latency is better than the Nova Pro. The Nova Pro has a nifty console that controls a lot of its features, but that console has massive design flaws - you'll go deaf from the tones every single time you adjust anything. It also prevents you from using your headphones via direct wired connection, which makes it difficult to use on places like airplanes.",
          "It's a really nice headset.  Great distance too. I can be in between rounds,  run to the kitchen for a drink that's 50 feet and 3 rooms away and stays connected.  Great sound quality.  Never had it due on me.  It's great",
          "Edit: Unable to find an alternative wireless headset for my needs, namely Xbox and PC capable, at a reasonable price. I tried this headset again.Again the device bricked, this time within a day or so, however I now know why it is bricking. Unlike some of steelseries other headsets this headset cannot handle being too far away from the plugged in dongle. Leaving the room with my wireless headset on my head I can walk maybe 10 feet before the sound cracks and the headset if not immediately brought closer will brick.Fortunately, this time my headset does actually have the reset button it is supposed to have and it works to reset the device. However this is an expensive WIRELESS headset, to have such an issue is embarrassing.If you are unsure of what bricking is here is the gist, the hardware is powered on (in this case) but loses all functionality INCLUDING the power button meaning it is stuck on and cannot use the headset or reboot. As described in the subject, this product bricked 26 days after Amazon's (turns out false) return window. (I'll get to why it's false at the he end for those interested)Second problem with this headset, the fix is a reset button in a pinhole under the ear cover. The pinhole should be in EITHER the left or right speaker, in my case there was a pinhole in both. NEITHER pinhole had a reset button inside, believe I tried to find the clickable button it does not exist. Therefore it is impossible to reset the bricked device.Lastly, I gave Steelseries customer service a descriptive message about my problem, the response I got was to and I quote \"Try factory resetting your Xbox Series X console\". The device wasn't even connected to the console. That suggestion was so far away from helpful I decided not even to bother with this terrible service because it would take hours just to make them understand what the actual problem was.About Amazon's shady return window. Fortunately, I bought Asurion insurance for the device because in 'My Orders' Amazon showed the device was no longer eligible for return, expired after 1 month I think. So I contacted Asurion the insurance Amazon uses. They refuse to honor policy because as it turned out after an hour long phone call, AMAZON has a secret return policy window for certain products like electronics one that apparently you would only know if you called and got a real person to file the return. Amazon MUST cover the product for X amount of time before Asurion will pay for it, so the return window you see in orders is actually a lie, (and in my opinion) designed to make people take a loss on their broken product.",
          "I think this is a really good headset perfect for playing for long periods of time, very comfortable and the 20 hour battery life is true, but I dropped my headset and the connector for the headphone broke and now it hangs off of my ear and Is uncomfortable, durability is not good but the headset is",
          "I have an XBox 1 and XBox Series S and have had issues trying to find a good headphone with a mic to play ESO.Just got my headphones on 1 Feb 23 and about 2 hrs into the ESO I\u2019m loving the product. The sound is crisp and clear and I haven\u2019t had any issue with the mic.My headphones were owned and only cost me about $70. So far no complains and worth the price I paid.",
          "Oh boy. These things are nice. Upgraded from the Plantronics Rig800LX because I wanted something with direct-connect to the Xbox. First thing I did was Bluetooth connect them to my phone to check general sound quality. I listened to some music that is particularly demanding for headphones I\u2019ve owned in the past and they performed exceptionally well. The Bluetooth connection is very reliable too; every time I turn on the headphones they immediately connect to my phone, and I\u2019ve had issues in the past with the reliability of Bluetooth headphone auto-pairing.As for gaming, they are superb. I can actually hear footsteps from a ridiculous distance, something like 25-30 meters. It was a bit overwhelming at first to try and pinpoint footsteps in the cacophony of crystal-clear, distinct sounds I was hearing. I have since adjusted, and at some point will plug them into my PC to update firmware and make some custom sound profiles to reign in the distant footsteps so I can hear the forest from the trees so to speak.Party chat/volume controls: the volume controls are a bit too easy to adjust. The volume wheels have no resistance, meaning dialing them in can be a teeter-totter of overshooting your goal and having to fiddle quite a bit. Also if you\u2019re scratching your head, or making an adjustment to fit it\u2019s easy to bump the wheel skyrocketing the volume which can be jarring. Being aware of this after the first few times has made this a non issue. One major complaint I had about the Plantronics Rig800LX set was that the balance control for game volume/party chat had to be within a specific range or the sound would distort. This is not the case with the Steelseries set. You can adjust it to your liking without sacrificing audio quality.Battery life is great, they lasted for a week and a half of gaming 2 hr a day, a bit more over the weekend, so roughly 18-20 hr.Connection is very good; however, last night there was a slight bit of cutting out for just a few minutes after I paused Bluetooth music and left Bluetooth connected, but quickly went away after I disconnected Bluetooth (maybe interference from other sources too as we have a large number of wireless devices in a small room, including 2 wireless receivers for our surround sound system).Overall I think my complaints are minimal, and considering the quality and features, these are probably the best set available. I was willing to spend $300 or more but I also wanted Bluetooth, and these seemed like the best. I would like to have a more convenient charging solution instead of a cable, like some sort of dock to set them in, but a magnetic micro-usb cable with adapter is on its way and that\u2019ll be just fine. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!",
          "My personal preference is to have a toggle power button instead of a software button, not a big deal. This software button is terrible. Not sure why I have to hold it for an arbitrary amount of time, but it's damn annoying. Also really hard to determine what the state of the device is. It may be on, but volume is on zero, then there's no way of knowing if it's on or not. Bloody annoying.Then if you're trying to get it to make a sound, and do something wrong with the button (still not sure what) the headset goes into total sleeper mode. The power button cannot do anything to it, even a hardware reset does nothing to it. The only way I have found to get it out of sleeper mode is to wait a few days for the battery to run down, and charge it again. Bloody annoying when you try to do a customer call but your headset is still in sleeper mode.For the price I paid, I expect a lot more. I have gotten a lot more from much cheaper headsets.",
          "I watched some reviews complaining that these tend to lean towards the higher frequency range. I prefer that because of some hearing loss. However they also have strong bass.Out of the box with flat settings, I was not that impressed. Then I used the \"Sonic\" equalizer that comes with  there SteelSeries GG Client software. You can adjust them to whatever you prefer and sounds great thru all frequencies. The best part is the Sonic software will work with any audio out device. It made my Altec Lansing PC speakers pop. I was thinking of getting new PC / Gaming / etc... speakers. No need. They sound great now that they are also tuned.",
          "Love the sound when you can find the right spot with the voice chat/game noise wheel. It can be great but the issue is that it all just feels like incredibly cheap plastic. After having A50s for years these just feel like knock off headphones but have great sound. I had a pair of Steelseries back in 2013 that were better made quality than these",
          "Great headset. Sometimes it struggles to maintain connection to Xbox. It crackles and skips every once in a while. In my experience, Microsoft Bluetooth isn\u2019t great with my controller and headset, so it isn\u2019t the product\u2019s fault, but I\u2019ve had better experience with headsets that use the Bluetooth dongle on Xbox."

        "rating": 4.6,
        "reviews": [
          "Purchased this back in October of 2019, and wanted to give it adequate time of use before writing up a reasonable review of the mouse itself.I have a heavy hand when gaming, putting a lot of weight upon the mouse I use, and even max out any weights mice come with to make sure it doesn't slide around much during any sort of heavy-moving moments in gaming. Response time has proven amazing! I typically played games at 2000-3000 DPI on the regular due to small desk space, but after purchasing a larger desk, I've slowly trained myself to play at about 600-1000 DPI. High or low DPI, this mouse meets those demands.However, the only issue I have encountered with this mouse is the thumb rest material, which feels like a rubberized, shaped insert along the thumb rest, and thumb buttons. I need my mouse to have a wide thumb rest as I dislike having my thumb drag along my mousepads. However, the material they used seems to degrade very quickly. Within the first few months, I had managed to wear the etched-in pattern down, and within a few months following, had worn it nearly smooth. In the year or so since purchasing, the material has actually worn down to nearly to the housing of the mouse itself. While cleaning the mouse with Isopropyl Alcohol (91%), I've noticed that thumb rest material leaves behind residue on the cleaning rag I use (low-lint rag).  This is the only issue I have with the mouse construction-wise.Shape of the mouse is great, the response and performance is great. If you need a mouse that has a low curve and wide hold, and you need a thumb rest, this mouse is for you. Just be mindful of the thumb rest will wear out on you (rubber wise) relatively quickly (approximately a year or less, give or take).",
          "This mouse has a truly fantastic build quality across the board.Pros:I love the materials your hand rests on.The movement is smooth and has a nice feel/weight to itThe thumb rest is super comfy (thought I would hate it, but it's become one of my favorite features).The buttons all feel super responsive without any extra play. Perfect tactile response. Really a cut above the rest in this department.Cons:Can't rebind the DPI and profile buttons. No matter what I do in iCue, the DPI button won't remap, and the the profile buttons (which I think SHOULD be the DPI buttons) don't even give you the option to remap.This is kind of a major problem, because the DPI buttons are extremely easy to accidentally press when in a tough gaming moment. You can go in and swap all of your DPI settings to the same speed, but then you can't lower your DPI for shooting games and raise it back up for normal computer use like I do. If they can fix this, this is easily a 5 star mouse.EDIT: Forgot to mention that iCUE just randomly stops working quite often. This brings a host of other issues, the most important one being that you lose all buttons except left/right click and scroll. This is a HUGE problem and Corsair needs to fix this asap, because from my perspective as a consumer, I'm not getting the product I paid for.",
          "I have large hands and it's hard for me to find any mice comfortable, all logitechs are too small and cramp my hand. This solves the issue, but I don't really care for the icue software that you have to use and always have running if you don't want to use the default dpi (why save it to the mouse?) And now about 10 months in the middle mouse button just stopped working out of the blue, and apparently I use it alot because it's starting to irritate me. I guess it's off on another quest for a comfortable mouse for large hands that wont be dead in less than a year.",
          "It's a great mouse for what it is. Good DPI, fits the hand well.An issue is that for a reason that is known only to Corsair, they decided to put the DPI up and down toggles right next to the left mouse button. I cannot understand this decision. My hands are too large so about half the time I'm going to click the button, I instead press a DPI toggle button, which tends to get me killed. This is a major issue on a GAMING mouse. Corsair, if you read this (lol) please think about changing the location of the DPI toggles on the next generation. Or you could make it so they require more tension to actually activate. Easy fixes that I know you won't do anything about.Anyway, you can disable the buttons in software, which is what I had to end up doing, but wow corsair, its like you didn't even bother testing this mouse before releasing it. Hire better designers.",
          "This sucker has 10 buttons, which is 5 more buttons that aren't on your average mouse, which are all customizable for macros.It has full RGB support and is customizable using the iCue software.It is a pretty big mouse and is relatively elevated more compared to most mice, but that's exactly what I wanted and this mouse was perfect for me.The thumb rest is very comfortable and the material used for this is great.Great mouse for gaming.",
          "Pros: Lots of programmable buttons,adjustable DPI, RGB looks cool with my desktop setup.Cons: I have smaller hands, and this mouse is a bit too large for me. I have to adjust my grip on it in order to use the sniper button, and I hit the ICUE profile switch buttons on the top accidentally because of this. Why are there no smaller mice that have these features!? My former mouse (Razor) was perfect, but with a new build using RGB everything, I wanted to keep with ICUE software (despite its flaws, its easier when everything is the same).Overall, its a nice mouse with nice features, and seems well built.But if your hand is smaller, be aware!!",
          "Impressions after 1 week. May update if something goes wrong later, otherwise see you in a few years.----------------------------------------------------------------------My hands measure 18 x 10 cm and I use a palm grip. Length is measured from tip of middle finger to base of palm, and width is measured from edge of pinky to edge of thumb when all fingers are placed together.I've mained 4 mice over the years, including this one. M65 RGB, M65 RGB Elite, Razer Basilisk x Hyperspeed, and this Corsair Nightsword. The original M65 RGB was a real tank that lasted me 5+ years of hard usage. The switches are still 100% responsive, but I ruined the surface coat with acetone so I upgraded to the Elite. The M65 Elite started losing responsiveness in the left click after 4 months. The Basilisk x Hyperspeed was meant to be my wireless mouse while commuting. It felt decently comfortable in store and the shape was very well done except for a slightly-off hump placement, but after a while of using it, I realized the mouse was not wide enough for my hands, which would cause some discomfort after continuous use. But for my typical not-so-heavy usage while on the go, it is acceptable. The M65/Elite (both have nearly the same form factor) has been my daily driver for nearly 6 years so I will be doing a lot of comparison with it.Now the reason I'm talking about all these other mice is so you can get other comparisons of what mice I find comfortable. Mouse shape is the most subjective and also important factor when choosing a mouse. In particular grip width matters the most. I didn't think I had massive hands but apparently I do. To this date the only other mouse that has felt comfortable to me is the Corsair M65. I've tried all sorts of mice from Logitech and Razer, that all had raving reviews, including the G502 which the Nightsword was modeled after. All of them felt extremely uncomfortable to me with poor hump placement, small grip width, uncomfortable side button positioning, etc. The Roccat Kone Aimo supposedly also has a good size for my hands, but I have yet to try it out as stores will rarely put Roccats on display.----------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways, about the actual Nightsword.Feel/Comfort:This mouse feels like it was literally made for my hands. My hand dimensions are a little unusual, even compared to other 18 x 10 cm hands, as I have very long fingers relative to my palm size. This makes it even more difficult to find a good mouse. I can't really describe the feeling when I first tried it out in store before. I have never felt this level of comfort on any mouse, not even the M65, which is pretty comfortable, but not on this level. The Nightsword has curves in all the right places, buttons at the right positions, and my hand can rest on it effortlessly without having to cramp up my palm at all. The thumb wing is extremely nice as well. The sniper button is placed right near the tip of my thumb, which is the ideal position to hit it without having to bend or stretch at all. I can easily swing my thumb up to hit the forward and back buttons above it. The DPI switches which are cut out of the left click take some more effort to hit, but I don't really use them much for now. Still figuring out the optimal way to hit them. I can actually reach one comfortably with my thumb, and the other with my index finger.Weight:This mouse is way too heavy, even with all weights removed. I have to actually consciously grip the mouse a bit harder than usual when trying to lift the mouse up, otherwise it feels like it would slip out of my hand. Combined with the high LOD on this thing, it kind of feels like Corsair doesn't intend for you to ever lift the mouse. Center of gravity adjustment is a cool idea, but it feels like a gimmick right now.Sensor:The Nightsword uses the same PMW3391 optical sensor as the M65 Elite. Now here's the thing...for some unknown reason the Nightsword falls short of the M65 Elite's performance, despite having the same sensor. People say with high end mice, the sensor isn't a spec to look at because they are all practically the same, but I disagree. I have tried many different sensors that are all in this DPI range and 1000 Hz polling rate, but nothing else has felt as as silky smooth as the M65 Elite. In fact, not even the Nightsword with the same sensor feels as smooth. It's still great performance, but after experiencing the M65 elite, something is just lacking in the smoothness.The Lift-Off Distance (LOD) is also different from the M65 Elite. It feels ridiculously high, which is bad. The M65 Elite with the exact same sensor has one of the lowest LOD's on the market, at a height of 1 DVD thickness. The Nightsword is nearly 3 DVD's in LOD, while 2 is the current industry standard. This seems to be a common issue in other reviews, so it is definitely not a one-off.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buttons:This is really one of the huge flawed areas of this mouse. It seems like corsair got all the button actuation forces backwards.* L/R click:Split trigger buttons (buttons are completely separate cutouts from the main body of the mouse) and highly sensitive. I personally dislike split trigger but some people may disagree on this. When you have split trigger buttons there is less \"springiness\" and long term feedback to the button. If you need to hold down left or right click a lot for extended periods of time, this becomes a problem. It is very easy to accidentally let go of the button when you don't have that slight feedback of the button trying to spring back against your finger. Or, over time you start to press harder and harder which is also bad. The M65 Elite which was not split trigger had the perfect amount of feedback in my opinion. Split trigger can also sometimes jam the skin of your fingers in between the button, which was a problem on the Basilisk, but so far I haven't had this issue with the Nightsword. I also find the Nightsword L/R click to be a bit too sensitive. The first few days of use, I was constantly triggering the buttons by accident just by resting my hand on it, but I've adjusted now and it no longer happens.* Scroll/Middle click:Scrolling feels pretty good. It could be a tad bit less mushy, but I can still easily scroll one tick at a time and it doesn't ever move by accident. The middle click however, has some issues. It is not as firm as it should be. Applying a slight downward force without actuating it causes it to give way a bit and create a barely-audible creaking feedback as though the scroll wheel is loose.* Sniper Button:Interestingly enough this is actually the best button on this mouse. Perfect positioning, perfect actuation force. Well done.* Forward/Back:Takes WAY too much force to press. My thumb feels like it became 3x more buff after trying to hold down macros on these buttons (seriously). Additionally, the 2 buttons sometimes get stuck on each other. Press one, and it pushes on the other one, or sometimes even catches on the other when trying to release (you hear 2 \"clicks\" as the button tries to come back up). They are also slightly wobbly.* Profile Shift:Not too much to say about these except that they should be less sensitive. You'd think that they're pretty out of the way, but I have actually swapped profiles by accident a couple of times already. When flipping the mouse over to try out the weight system, they would constantly keep triggering just from the weight of the mouse.* DPI Shift:These have the same sensitivity as the L/R click, so I have the same opinion on that. The main thing about these is the shape. I understand that the intention was to keep the contour of the left click intact, but I would have liked to see the DPI-down button raised slightly higher so that it can be hit by rolling the index finger, without hitting the other buttons around it by accident.----------------------------------------------------------------------Build/Materials:I really like the left and right click material a lot on this mouse. Feels like a really high quality matte plastic and repels dirt really well. The glossy plastic on the side buttons gunks up extremely quickly and I don't even have sweaty or oily hands. The rubberized material on the rest of the mouse seems alright for now but it seems like it could deteriorate very quickly if you tried to scrub it for any cleaning. The textured surface seems to just be asking for gunk to get stuffed in the holes and be impossible to clean. We'll see. Scroll wheel and Forward/Back buttons could be less wobbly as I described before but otherwise build quality is very good.----------------------------------------------------------------------Final comments for Corsair:I really want to see you guys combine all the best things into one mouse. The form factor of the Nightsword + the M65 Elite's sensor, button build quality, material, and button actuation forces + optical switches (a lot of left/right click problems with many of your recent mice) + less weight, and maybe wireless. That would be my dream mouse.",
          "I love this mouse. It does everything I need it to. It feels great in my hand. It's very accurate and the button placement is great. I use it A LOT. I have had to buy 3 in the last 2 years because the right click will randomly start to release while holding it down after 4-6 months.It's absolutely maddening that the same exact defect has been in all 3 that I have had. I have changed to a different mouse because of it.I really wish they would fix this issue or release a version 2 that doesn't break down, I love this mouse. It just breaks down.",
          "My older M65 Pro started having click issues so I just bought this. I especially like the thumb rest. Corsair makes quality PC gamming hardware. I've been a PC gamer for over 20 years. Before Corsair was even around I think. I've had and used just about everything there is but now since Corsair has expanded it's products in PC gaming I use them exclusively. Cases, fans, PSU's, keyboard's and mice. Good stuff.",
          "In less than a year the left mouse button began double clicking on a single click. This can be a serious issue when playing video games or creating art/graphic design. Imagine in a game, trying to click an item in your inventory only to have it repeatedly put it back down right away, or anywhere where a rapid double click could cause unwanted effects.Not only this, but the software is terrible. I am currently using this mouse, a corsair keyboard, and a corsair AIO, the software has had a range of issues on and off. Sometimes my middle mouse wheel click won't function properly, but closing the software solves it, or the lights randomly go off and stay off on the AIO. The software has had various issues since I began using it after getting this mouse.I looked up the double click issue awhile ago, apparently Corsair has had this issue in other mice, and they continue to use the same manufacturer for the clicker despite all of the reported issues with it over the years. They seem to have no desire to resolve it.RECOMMENDATION: Stay away from Corsair peripherals. I know I will after this.EDIT UPDATE: So I contacted customer service, they were super helpful and sent me a replacement quickly and even allowed me to continue using the old mouse until I got it before sending the old one back. The process was virtually painless. I've been using the replacement for going on a year now without double clicking so far. I also did my research back then and found out many other common gaming mice brands have the same issue these days as many of them share the same OMRON switches that seem to have this issue more often. My research led me to mice that use other switches instead, but either those mice or those switches host their own issues.So, based on what you're looking for in a mouse, whether you need the extra features or not, another brand with another switch might be for you, if not, at least Corsair seems to have good customer service, so if it should start acting up on you, you'll be able to get a replacement.Because of my experience with customer service, and liking most of the other mouse features and ICUE software seeming to be better these days, I'll change my rating from 1 to 3.",
          "My son wore out his first one. Wanted another one. This is his second one after two years of daily use. Hour after hour of use this mouse has held up. Highly recommend.",
          "Very high quality. The weight tuning system is pretty cool, it's almost like you can feel it adjust. The mouse itself is very good, and made for bigger hands. The first mouse with a thumb button that actually fits me. Has many adjustable features, like DPS and programmable buttons, however the iCUE software is a little confusing. I'd suggest getting yourself accompanied with the software before you make major changes to the buttons. The RGBs are beautiful, and it slides very nicely. Overall a very high quality mouse.",
          "I like this mouse, it feels nice. However, on my less expensive razer I can push the mouse wheel left or right to activate buttons in addition to pressing down on the wheel. This one only has one function for mouse wheel. It's a better mouse overall, but I had gotten used to this feature and am disappointed it's not included.",
          "Its a great mouse but the sniper button is too far forward. Not a reason to down rate it though.",
          "I've had several Corsair mice over the years, and this one stacks right up at the top of the stack. Keep in mind, if you want full use of it, you will need the software.That said, this mouse is completely customizable to your use style. it even comes with additional weights that can use.My only complaint, and this is across all Corsair mice, is that the middle click seems to stop working after a couple of years. Get the extended warranty.",
          "I have been a Corsair fanboy for quite some time.My mouse, keyboard, headset, PSU, desktop tower case, and fans are all Corsair. I've gone through at least 6 different Corsair mice over the years and a few sticks of RAM as well.Unfortunately, I can no longer support this company as its customer service and quality has changed so dramatically over the years to the point where it's hardly recognizable anymore.I have a good friend who's brother had purchased a closed system water cooler from Corsair. Unfortunately, it was faulty and ended up leaking on two GPUs - completely ruining them. He contacted Corsair and they ended up replacing both GPUs with equal to or greater than specifications and value as well as the faulty water cooler, mailing them to him with Next-Day mail.I have told this story to others many-many times emphasizing the amazing customer service that just can't be beat. It's quite rare to hear of a large company being so attentive to the concerns of their customers and image of their company.Regrettably, that is no longer the case.Firstly, I've never really had a problem with Corsair products before this. They were consistently of superb quality so I never had a reason to test their customer service myself.I owned a Corsair M65 PRO mouse for over two years before it finally reached the end of its life by beginning to double click on single strokes randomly. I wasn't bothered by this the least bit. I had paid $69 for the mouse and absolutely loved it; I would have gladly paid an extra $30 for that mouse because I think it was worth it. I replaced my old mouse with the new version of it, the Corsair M65 ELITE. There's a few differences between the two and in all honestly, I still preferred the older version (PRO) but I figured that that was mostly just because I was more used to the other one. I only owned the new mouse for a few weeks before it started to double click on me. Honestly, I still wasn't really bothered. Stuff happens and I still love Corsair. In my head, I just got unlucky. No matter though, I'm still within store exchange criteria so I took it back to Best Buy and swapped it out for another of exactly the same type.In roughly 6 months of use, this mouse started to double click too - like really bad. I was outside of the time limit for in-store exchanges but still within Corsair's manufacturing warranty and, with no worry on my mind because I knew how great Corsair's customer service was, I contacted Corsair on February 2nd to get an exchange. Feb 8th, I get a reply telling me to try resetting my mouse. I did as they asked, gave it a day to test, but it did not resolve the issue. So I emailed them back letting them know. February 18th, I am contacted by a different representative wanting information on my device; just basic things like serial numbers and receipts, which I had. However, I could tell this process was going to take longer than expected so I went ahead and bought a new mouse to use in the sequent time because the double clicking one was driving me nuts.I actually decided to upgrade and try a different mouse because after using it for some time, I missed the extra weight the M65 PRO had whereas the ELITE was slightly lighter. I was also worried I'd get another faulty mouse that would crap out on me in a few months so I bought the Corsair Nightsword (wired) which is pretty much just a mega upgraded version of the M65 with more weight, a thumb rest, and 2 extra buttons (in all honesty, I really like it a lot).So when I replied to the representative who was asking for necessary information, I also let him know that I had purchased a new mouse to use in the sequent time because of the reasons listed above and also provided pictures of that for proof of purchase. I queried if I could get credit instead since I've already replaced the mouse with a different one from their company that I like a lot and told them that I had been wanting to purchase the Corsair Commander Pro lighting kit for some time so if there was any way they could apply it towards that and I would pay the difference, that would be most ideal. To be clear, I am acknowledging that I will be paying shipping and handling to RMA a faulty mouse and then offering to pay them an additional $25 on the difference of a new component.They contacted me back days later and declined stating that they can't provide credit but they would send me another mouse once the RMA mouse arrived at their facility. I didn't like that response and feel that I had been very cordial and respectful with them thus far but now I felt disrespected because not only did they turn down my suggestion, which I feel is more than fair especially considering I'm offering to pay them more, but the mouse they offered to replace it with was the Ironclaw... It's nothing like the M65 and is also $15 cheaper in market value... So I contacted them again, angry but trying to be as polite as I can and laid out why the resolution they offered me was ridiculously unsatisfactory. Not only am I going to pay for shipping and handling to return a faulty device, but I am to receive a different product that is $15 less in market value than the M65 and $30 less than the new Nightsword I had purchased to replace myself due to the RMA process taking far too long and knowing it'd take an additional 2 - 3 weeks to actually have another mouse on my doorstep.They sent me to another representative who then told me that they'd replace my M65 ELITE with another M65 ELITE....but it would be refurbished...This whole process has been going on for a month and a half now.Quite bluntly, I'm very angry with Corsair over this. It's just so damn disappointing and frustrating to see this company turn into another cheap, corner cutting franchise who's priorities, at least from my perspective, have drastically changed from extreme customer satisfaction to one who's only concern appears to be in profit margins. \"Deal with it\" and \"We expect you to pay for our mistakes\" attitudes. This is also exactly the same reason as to why I stopped buying Razer products nearly 10 years ago now.And to be clear, having the customer pay for S&H on RMAs is really not cool. It is -not- the customer's fault that the product \"X\" company manufactured isn't operating as intended and is broken. The customer has already paid for S&H in their original purchase and if they drove to a store to buy it in person, they've spent their time and gas money to do so. Even the store they bought it from has paid for shipping and handling to put it on their shelves. It's also not the store's fault the product they ordered from \"X\" company is faulty. This is a really uncool business practice that has become increasingly more common. Amazon, however, just tells you to take it to any UPS office and slap your hands of the dust. Truthfully, I've only had to do that once and was very surprised by the lack of requirements. Like, you don't even need to box it...But again, I was willing to accept that Corsair would require me to pay S&H to RMA a product that probably shouldn't have left their facilities in the first place due to the fact that the Omicron switch they so proudly boast about didn't meet a fraction of the projected clicks and accuracy it claimed; aka: faulty/defective. So I still feel the resolution I initially suggested was more than fair considering I had already paid them $10 more for a better mouse, would be paying another $10 for S&H to RMA the defective mouse, and then would be paying them an additional $25 for a new component....They felt the best resolution was for me to pay to return my more expensive RMA mouse for a less expensive one, wait 2+ months without a mouse (should I return the one I just bought myself), and deal with it.It's because of this that I can firmly say that I will never buy another Corsair product again and I highly recommend against others from purchasing from them too. Their products -USED- to be good and sometimes you can get lucky with getting one that lasts for years, it used to be the other way around where you'd just get unlucky to get a bad one....now it seems to be more common, but if something is wrong with it - well, just don't expect Corsair to give a shit about making it right... And that's not an investment worth making nor is it a company I wish to support in ethical business practices...",
          "Ok so I'm a really shaky person in general and a CSGO (4:3 1280*960) / Valorant player (16:9) / COD (16:9) (usually play within 3-4 hours a day)... I'm used to high sense due to I started playing 5 years ago with a small mousepad and a Redragon M601 mouse (which is a little bit heavy for the size), after 3 years, I bought a Razer Deathadder and a Steel Series small mousepad because I didn't know anything about gaming peripherals, being honest, this was a terrible mistake. The mousepad was ok, but Razer Deathadder mice is really big AND lightweight mouse to what I was used to... So reading about mices, I found the Benq Zowie EC2-B Medium... The mice was pretty cool, but I also have sweaty hands, so even my aim was there, my spray was terrible due to the mouse was too small and not as heavy as I needed as I'm really shaky and used to play high sense (I also had to decrease my sense which made me play pretty bad and derank)... Bought a Logitech G Pro XL Mouse pad (Which I though was going to fix my problem) but I kept shaking and it was reaaally hard to spray...After months of reading, I started looking for a heavy mice... Found this one, saw It had a decent design and decent weight, so I just went for it. In my first day using it I just destroyed everyone, even if I'm shaking, the weight helps me to keep the mouse stable, even if I'm sweating, the surface design helps a lot so I need to press the mouse harder...Also, I don't like to have softwares opened while I'm playing, but for this mouse, iCue has \"on board profile\" options, which allows you to store the settings on your mouse's memory and allow you to close the software at anytime.This is a good mice if:- You're a shaky person.- You have medium / big hands.- You have sweaty hands (shaky people usually have sweaty hands).- Play high sense.",
          "This mouse is one of the more expensive gaming mice available. You buy something like this (as opposed to just a regular old mouse) when you want some extra buttons on your mouse compared to a more basic one and want to have more control over exactly what your mouse does. Although this mouse is plug-n-play, you can (and should) download the software that pairs with it so you can customize it to your needs. This includes changing what the buttons do, changing the lighting (or removing it entirely if you prefer), and changing the sensitivity.Recently I tried two top gaming mice, the Razer Naga Trinity and this Corsair Nightsword. I first got the Naga Trinity and would have stayed with it but I had some double-clicking issues when it first arrived. Sometimes when I tried to click things or select text, it would do an extra click or not click at all, which was quite frustrating. I had no choice but to either replace it or try a different mouse, and I opted for the latter.Before I continue, do note that I have pretty large hands (8.25\" from middle finger tip to the crease on my wrist, 4\" across the widest part of my palm (across the knuckles), and nearly 10\" from my thumb tip to my pinky tip when my hands are open wide as if I were trying to palm a basketball) and I use a fintertip style grip (see pictures) on my mouse \u2014 your own hand size and grip style will determine whether each of these mice is a good fit for you.Here is what I like and dislike about each, with points from -3 to +3 next to each point which indicate how much I like or dislike each feature (-3 being very much dislike, +3 being very much like):Corsair Nightsword:A. [+3] it has two additional buttons to click on top (gives more top button options for gaming, the Razer only has extra side buttons)B. [+1] it has more protection for the thumb (although my thumb doesn't really drag on the mousepad without it, it's a nice touch)C. [+1] DPI level can be seen from the side of the mouse (rather than the normal which I feel like is by the center top of the mouse which you can't see when your hand is there), a the mouse changes color when you press it to make the change even more salientD. [+0.5] Aesthetically looks better than the Razer Naga in my opinionE. [-1] Middle mouse wheel requires a bit more force than I would like to click itF. [-3] (Dealbreaker for me) I can only reach 1 of the 3 side thumb buttons with my normal grip, despite the fact that I have large hands. I would need to convert to palm grip which is not really desirable as it's less precise with clicking.Razer Naga Trinity:A. [+3] Changeable side panels allow you to use the button setup you prefer, although I feel like the 12 button grid is a bit excess and wish there was an option for a 6-button grid.B. [+3] The mouse wheel can be tilted left or right which is handy, they can be configured as extra buttonsC. [-3] The double-clicking / misclicking issue I described above. Strangely, it seems to occur much less now for no reason I can explain, but if it happens even one more time I'm going to have to replace the mouse. Note: My particular mouse might simply be defective, but other reviewers have said this is an issue for them as well so clearly there's some sort of quality control issue.For me, the 12-button side panel is great because the way I naturally use the mouse my thumb rests right in the center of all the buttons, making them all accessible if need-be (though pressing the middle buttons is a bit trickier, at least I can reach all of them whereas my partner with smaller hands cannot easily press all the buttons even if she wanted to).I'll probably stick with the Razer Naga trinity (and re-order a new one if the clicking issues persist) simply because the side buttons difficult to reach for me with the Corsair Nightsword, but I hope I provided enough detail so you can make a more-informed decision for yourself. :)",
          "I recently purchased a prebuilt corsair computer and figured i would get corsair brand hardware to go along with it. Works really well in the iCUE software and synchs perfectly with my desktop and keyboard. When i unboxed it I didn\u2019t realize that the mouse came with weights and honestly I really like them.",
          "The mouse is a bit bigger than I expected. I went from the logitech 502 hero which fit perfectly in my hand to this corsair one which is set up a about the same as the hero just a bit bigger.This one has weights in it similar to the logitech if you prefer heavier mice and has a some nice features for mmos and fps games such as a sniper button that helps lower the dpi for steady aiming.The mouse itself is wired (I dislike wireless personally) it has a nice rubber padding on it unlike the 502 and a big issue I had with logitech in general is their ghub updates would disconnect and make me reset up things. It didn't happen every update but for discord their headset would constantly do it and also it disabled that sniper button on the 502 which I macro'd for push to talk. This mouse like my corsair keyboard doesn't need the icue software to function, but you use the icue software to macro and set up things. The icue is also more advanced than the ghub which makes the macro setting up much more confusing but allows for more interesting customization.The RGB lighting can change to any color. I personally chose blue but you can choose whatever fits your needs.Its a bit pricey, it was between this and the corsair scimitar however I didn't seem to enjoy the look of the scimitar and chose this over it.I can swear by corsair products as I personally had little to no issues unlike logitech. I had everything logitech at one point and I'm slowly phasing it all to be corsair. All thats left is the headset.. If you're a gamer or just looking for a comfortable cool mouse, this is the way to go.",
          "I have had this mouse for about 2-3 weeks. So I can give a pretty good review on it.  For gaming it works! fits my wide hand perfectly! It has a good response and switches(aside from the profile/dpi) work like a charm. that is where the star falls.  When you browse on the web or do typing or blogs you are going to be scrolling an aweful lot!  When you do your scroll wheel so too close to the profile \"switch\" button. often times I find my mouse switching to a lower DPI profile and at basline speed (lowest setting DPI) when you switch profile it goes to the lowest DPI setting after switch! this is not good when browsing as you often fatfinger the scrollwheel/profile switch button and wonder why your mouse suddenly crawls to a snail's pace. dangerous in some cases if you want to avoid pop up banner click bait. at the very least annoying. and NO it is not a malware! you not someone else has switched your profile(more than likely) by fat fingering the scrollwheel/profile switch. the button and the wheel are too close together!  Also Corsair could make it where your new profile switch stays on the same DPI level as your old. for instance if you are on level two it needs to stay on level two when you switch from Proflie A to Profile B and C and so on. Would partially fix the problem. another thing: the switch and wheel should have a larger gap for people with larger fingers. not all of us are piano players you know... Some people complain about the scrollwheel being cheap plastic(at least on the other Scimitar) this one is also. I cannot judge as I have not had it long enough to know when/if it could(or not) break.  It feels okay, just okay, not too flimsy not sturdy though either. same with the Scimitar which I also have. This Nightsword WASP FPS mouse feels less cheap and more sturdy than the Scimitar. why? Probably because the weights in it give it that illusion but it also feels less mushy in clicking L/R the hand grip rubber is better quality and it has flanks on the side for stablity.  I find it works for both FPS and RPG games and I don't play too many stratigy games anyway.  If you use it I recommend programming iCUE on another PC to hardware settings(LTD as they are) and then safely utilizing the mouse on a computer without iCue loaded(unless you have a lightening fast machine or play offline as I often do)  If you program settings you can reprogram it later as many times as you want as you change or play different games.  Also browsing and Icue is dangerous these days! Icue reputedly opens up backdoors to your firewall. I'd just use it for programming hardware and leave it off or use another computer to play games on without iCue loaded.",
          "I have big hands. I bought the Logitech G604 light speed and it felt like it was made of paper. I miss the G602... We fought so many hours of battles I couldn't even count. I loved the grip of the 604 but it felt cheap and because there was no weight to it (the right clicker was defective anyway) I returned it. My hands said, \"I don't feel any love, where are you? Why don't you call or write?\" So, I decide to fork out some money for this mouse. I know, the Razer mice line has some great reviews, but not being able to go to a store and actually FEEL a mouse makes it hard to buy online. I've felt some Razers before. Razer is pricey. Perhaps they are as great as people say they are (even though idiots complain of \"bloatware\"). The Nightsword feels like the best in between Logitech and Razer. The right clicker does have this elevated edge that takes some getting used to. It feels like I am clicking on a mountain on the right side. It throws me off a bit. I wish they would have just left it flat or at least had not elevated it as much. However, soon, through muscle memory (all hail MM) my finger will begin to position itself in the right location. I've read people complain about the \"lip\" at the bottom of the thumb. I love how big it is. Remind me of the 602. This gives my thumb a platform to \"scoot n' shoot\". Definitely not an MMO mouse. Probably mouse was a bit more pricey due to the fact that it has RGB. RGB is cool only when your hand isn't on the mouse. So, if you don't play much but leave your computer on this is definitely the mouse for you. Being able to customize the lights is pretty cool and the DPI settings are just perfect.Let's talk about bloatware (\"There Will Be Blood voice\"). Bloatware complaints? Get a life. I have a Corsair keyboard that uses the same \"bloatware\". Get some more ram or a better CPU. Love this mouse and the custom weights it comes with. Reminds me of my old G602  (sheds some tears). I used the 602 back in 2009 and it is still $100. Get real. Get this one. As soon as my hand touched this I heard a voice come from my hand that said, \"I love you.\" I was a bit spooked at first but, I think this is a relationship that will actually work out. It may even last longer than my real life human to human relationships. Game on my friends.",
          "Another great Corsair mouse. Plug and play, fully customizable buttons and lights. Not to flashy, very professional looking.Unfortunately, this is quite a large mouse. Come with big hands!",
          "2500+ hours in Apex, 1000+ Hours in Warzone, Countless in other games across the spectrum. This mouse is SOLID and I tried other alternatives when my first one was just disgusting beyond disgusting my wife wouldn't touch it anymore and all the cleaning solutions and q-tips in the world did me no good anymore.So I bought another after my failed attempts at other options. Sticking with the solid gold mouse that is.",
          "As an avid gamer and streamer.. there's alot to love about the nightsword..+Ergonomic design+Smooth movement over mousepad+Customizable weight (seriously.. makes it FEEL that much better)+The buttons (dear god the buttons, there's SO MANY!)But.. where there's things to love.. there's things to hate..- Corsair's ICUE (which you have to run, in my case)- Sniper Button is defaulted to a soft DPI switch rather than a programmable button, without ICUENow while the cons are few.. one of them is a HUGE con.Corsair's ICUE is the bane of my existence.. it makes everything work and look nice but when there's an issue, or a need for an update... all hell breaks loose.We're talking:-Floating Mouse (mouse movements after your input has stopped)-Refusal to recognize input (click no work bro)-PROFILE CHANGES (Dear god the vertigo)And lastly..-When trying to fix the above, ICUE just straight up crashes, causing everything to grind to a halt, and can take up to 20 minutes to restart when in THE MIDDLE OF A F&*^%@##! GAME!Alright.. got that out of my system. All in all, the Nightsword is amazing, worth the price too. If it weren't for the fact my thumb doesn't reach the Sniper button (remapped for melee in R6:Siege) easily, and if it weren't the fact that it runs on ICUE and only allows the Sniper button to be reprogrammed with it running... it'd be the perfect FPS and/or MMO mouse.. for me anyway.Previous Mouse use my review is based on:Corsair M65 Pro Wired (Sniper button was better placed imo) Usage: 2.5 YearsCorsair Ironclaw RGB  Wired (4/10 would not recommend) Usage: 4 months (Middle Wheel Snapped Off)Logitech G502 Wired (Button placement and Software were great, overall quality of mouse wasn't) Usage: 2 Years (Still works.. kinda..)",
          "READ SECOND EDIT BELOWThe buttons are easier and harder than what I'm used to but for playing battlefield, it has somehow made a huge difference in a positive way. The sniping button is pretty cool. iCue profiles are a little weird and take a bit to learn how to use but I do see how they could be beneficial. The per application feature is nice. Good mouse. Buttons are hyper sensitive so moving my mouse, sometimes I accidentally right click. I have very large hands but I'm used to \"claw gripping\" or whatever it's called. Not a bad mouse. I can see this lasting a couple years. The rubberized feel of the mouse is very nice. I am a fan of that. Good for daily use too. LEDs are nice for at night, they are not overbearing and not too bright. Brightness can be adjusted in iCue too.EDIT: I would never recommend this mouse to anyone. The hardware is fantastic, the feel, the buttons, everything is great. But the iCue software is absolute garbage. I use it to set aggressive fan curves on my fans and cooler with a commander module. So I need to use the iCue software. However, every once in a while (every hour or so) the iCue software does something to the mouse and it gets super sensitive (insanely high DPI). I then have to kill iCue and reopen it. It doesn't take long to do that but it's extremely aggravating as it interrupts whatever I am doing. Would not recommend this mouse, will be trying Logitech G502 and saving this corsair mouse (which is very comfortable) as a backup emergency mouse.SECOND EDIT: Still a little salty about the icue profiles. I didn't realize it but there is a way to upload the dpi profile to the mouse and remove the stock ones, not gonna lie, the mouse is phenomenal now! If you are having trouble look up how to upload the profile to the mouse and remove the old profiles on it, it stops the mouse from defaulting to a extremely high dpi mid session. Wish they made this a little more visible in the icue software but I guess not everything can be super intuitive. I would recommend this mouse now. Remember tho, default mouse profiles have to be wiped from the mouse, not just from icue itself.",
          "I've been using this mouse for about a year and a half now.  It is SUPER comfortable, really responsive, and has the perfect size and weight options for my hand.  I am a huge Corsair fan simply because of this mouse alone.  It is a large mouse, but that's also a good thing - it allows your hand to rest more comfortably on it without fatigue or strain.  Great product, certainly worth the investment over budget options.  I've used a few Steel Series and Razers over the years, this is by far my favorite gaming mouse.",
          "First off, I returned this mouse because the left mouse button felt sticky and sometimes seemed to double click when not intending to do so.  I really did not factor this into the rating because I have not read any other people complaining about this and decided that it probably was just a one off.  I probably would have returned it anyway as it did not work as I hoped it would.I have a larger than average hand size and I have found most mice too narrow to hold.  This mouse's dimensions appealed to me on paper, but when I finally got it, it felt off.  My hand really did not sit where I thought it should and ring finder and pinky on my right hand would often click the right mouse button moving the mouse quickly to the left.  When I moved the pinky to where I thought it should sit, it felt off.One other odd thing is that the bottom of mouse's angles are not smoothed (where the side meets the bottom.  They are sharp and there is only the width of the mouse feet preventing them from touching the mousepad.  So while normal gliding feels okay, if you move the mouse quickly or press too hard, that sharp edge scraps the mousepad. Odd design.Overall feel of materials is fine and generally it feels well constructed.  The tracking also feels pretty good, but I personally think the G502 Hero feels much better in the tracking department.If Corsair ever updates this design I would take another potential look at it.  I like the G502 Hero and it is what I am currently using, but it is a bit narrow.  Unfortunately there are not too many 10+ button mice on the market that are good for gaming in my opinion.",
          "When I gamed quite a bit more in the early 2010s I had a Logitech G500s that I really enjoyed.  After a solid 7 years where my PC sat without being used, I recently got back into gaming.  I wanted an upgrade as my G500s had the well-documented double-click issue that made using it a chore.  I then had a Logitech G300s and G502 SE and really liked the latter.  But I have a Corsair K95 keyboard and really wanted it to work in tandem with my mouse.  Plus, the Logitech G Hub just would not load on my older PC without having to use a nearly year-old software version.  So I took the plunge and spent a bit more on a mouse than I wanted to with this Nightsword.Like others have said, smaller hands may find this mouse a bit unruly.  Initially, I was nervous, as it just felt weird and the scroll wheel and sniper button felt too far forward.  I have decent-sized hands, and previously used more of a claw grip rather than a palm grip--but I've had to change to more of a palm grip to really get the benefit from the Nightsword.  It's big, but after a week of use, it became a very natural feeling, although I still wish the scroll wheel was brought back toward the center of the mouse slightly--my pointer finger hits the bottom of it rather than right on top where I'd prefer.  The same goes for the sniper button--it's just a bit too forward.There are a few other gripes which I may get used to with more use, but for now, have to point out.  I really miss being able to press the button below my Logitech's scroll wheel and have it free-spin; the Nightsword has no such option.  It also doesn't have the ability to click the scroll wheel right or left--and while I rarely used that on my Logitech, still wish it were present.  You can click the wheel down, but it doesn't feel clean at all, and I seem to mistakenly press it quite often.  I also MUCH prefer the tactile click of Logitech's programmable buttons.  The buttons of the Nightsword feel super mushy and don't feel super-satisfying or confidence-inducing when pressing.  This has been probably my biggest disappointment.But gripes aside, this mouse has grown on me.  The shape and contour are comfortable and the thumb rest is the best I've used.  Plus having the RGB synced with my K95 is great.  The weight system is a nice touch as well as you can really dial in the weight and center of mass to your liking.  Unlike the G Hub, the iCue software loaded no problem, but I still don't think it's the most intuitive and I still have some problems with it switching profiles when I do not ask it to.Overall if I wasn't tied into the Corsair ecosystem, I'd probably have stuck with the G502.  It was half the price, had more characteristics that I liked, and was probably better suited to my hand and playstyle.  But I do like the Nightsword and will stick with it.",
          "I ordered this for my teen as he was having issues with his last one. He says his wrist does hurt and he loves the easy access to the buttons and wheel.",
          "I use my mouse for gaming and it was very uncomfortable for the first week. I usually play claw so that may be the issue but I also think the big button on the thumb side of the mouse is positioned way to far forward on the mouse. In the picture you can see my thumb barley touches it when I sit my hand comfortably on the mouse. That button and the back and forward button on the same side of the mouse have a lot of resistance to them. Not sure if that\u2019s because it\u2019s new or by design.I measured my hand from my palm to middle finger to give you an idea of how the mouse fits in my hand. My hand length is a about 7\u201d 1/4 and if I lay my hand over the top of the mouse it barley reaches over the full length of it. This causes me to constantly readjust my grip to hit certain buttons and has caused a lot of hand fatigue but more so when I first got it and during really long gaming sessions -over 5 hours-Everything else about this mouse is high quality, I wish the back part was more rubbery as it looked but it has almost the same feel as the rest of the mouse. I have no issues with software and it has held up great so far (about a month and a half). I have already purchased another mouse (roccat leadr) due to me not feeling comfortable with this one. Again that may be due to me playing claw or my hands being to small which is why I am only deduction one star.",
          "When I bought the mouse, I wanted many programmable buttons, truth is 10 of the buttons are for mouse adjustment, changing DPI and quick changes for aiming. It's nice but not what I expected. Comfortable with weight and shape, button placement is good too. Really enjoy the working and feel.",
          "Bought this mouse to replace and older corsair mouse that stopped working. It is actually a really good mouse. The buttons are responsive and the actions are very crisp. It feels good and smooth with all of the weights installed.Unfortunately the mouse cannot work without the ICue crap installed. My old mouse was perfectly happy switching between my work computer (which i can't install third party driver software) and my real computer. Corsair has decided that this is a luxury they cannot allow, and without their software this mouse instantly turns off all but the buttons one and two, reverts to the lowest sensitivity setting.  I tried updating Icue to see if it was a version issue, and their latest version of icue retroactively broke my corsair keyboard, which used to keep its settings when switching between computers. now it instantly goes to its default config, and turns off all RGB lights when it loses contact with icue.Really disappointed with corsair, will not be buying anything from them in the future.",
          "I have big hands (8 inches) and this mouse is very nice and fits comfortably in my hand. the curves in the left and right click buttons are very nice as it keeps my fingers centered and ready to click at all times. The weight system is also very nice and I have it so the back is more weighted than the front.  10/10 will buy it again once my current one breaks",
          "I had this mouse for a year and a half when the scroll started to fail... then I started getting ghost clicks and connection issues, so I switched to Logitech's G502 Hero. Used it for a while, but I HAD to come back to the Nightsword,,, The response and weight distribution is so much better on the Nightsword! And it fits my grip like a glove, it is my favorite",
          "This mouse feels incredible in my hand. The ergonomics are very smooth and allow for a more comfortable grip. There's some grippy stuff all over it as well, which makes it feel more under control. The buttons are very easy to program to another key to use for gaming, and the thumb buttons (not sniper button) are already recognized by games.",
          "I absolutely love this mouse. The only problem is my hand gets sore after a couple hours of use but only because it's designed for a bigger hand than my own not because of the mouse itself I'm a smaller than average guy so most may not have this problem.",
          "Bought this mouse in August of 2020, and it's finally starting to stutter (almost exactly two years later). I only notice it while playing an FPS. When first holding down the mouse button to fire, it will no longer do so. It'll fire once. stop. fire three more time. stop. continual fire. The only other issues I've experienced is accidentally hitting the side buttons  while gaming which has lost me a match/game more times than I can count. I still live the versatility of having the buttons. You just have to be caefule. The software is not easy to use but it's not horrible. I just hate having to constantly go through the motions of clicking the sensitivity button after every boot to bring my mouse up to my preset profile  The last thing I'll note is the texture. It feels super comfortable but I work manual labor jobs, and the amount of dead skin that is stuck in my mouse (below the surface) is definitely not hygienic. Now that specific experience is going to differ from person to person (obviously). Some may be thinking \"why not get a manicure, and exfoliate your hands\". Well, shovel for 10 hrs a day and then you'll understand why calluses are worth keeping. This was just my 2yr review. Yall do whatever. I however will be looking at probably downgrading to the corsair model below this one. It has a smooth finish (easy to keep clean), same hand fit, and easier to see red button on the left-hand side.",
          "I am loving this mouse.  Probably the best one I have had in years.  A little pricey, but if you can get it on sale I would definitely try it.",
          "I have been using Corsair products for quite some time, and as usual, this product is fantastic. 14/10",
          "argb light near sniper button doesn't light up.",
          "I had high hopes for this mouse coming off a myriad of Corsair products in the past that have always been reliable, and intuitive; that is until I purchased this new Nightsword mouse, and a K60 keyboard.The mouse is enormous, I have giant hands and can barely reach the \"sniper\" button having to lift my palm off the mouse to press it making it useless.  The middle mouse wheel button, which I use to open tabs/ close tabs while browsing the web works when it feels like it. I can press the button to open a tab multiple times and not a single press will register.  Other times I'll press the middle wheel to open a tab and two, sometimes three tabs will open.  Restarting the software will often fix this issue for the session, but I didn't pay all this money to have to constantly be troubleshooting, it's ridiculous.  The RGB profiles constantly restore themselves to default, and often the mouse and keyboard aren't recognized by the software suite.  It's really bad, I'm going back to a non software controlled mouse after using this June 2022 and struggling with it on a daily basis.  Waste of money , Corsair used to be about quality put the little boats back on the logo and fire whatever marketing genius that thinks its a good idea to cut corners for fluff.",
          "I use the mouse for MMOs and other games, it's a little bigger than my old mouse, but way more comfortable and ergonomic, with the buttons all in the right places. I have large hands so it kinda makes sense that this is perfect for me.Only issue, is a non-issue, and that's just from the iCue software being a little non-intuitive. But once that's out of the way I see no issues at all.",
          "Corsair has really outdone themselves with this mouse, I come from the G502 as my main and it's been difficult to find a competitor as far as form factor, feel and quality but i believe that Corsair has done just that.**Pros**1. I really enjoy the fact that it has the same layout as the G502 only slightly larger which is a major plus for me because even though i love the G502 it always felt a little small in my hands keep in mind that I do have larger that normal hands too.2. I like the fact that it has the sniper button like the M65, I don't use this button to actually snipe I always rebind it to a melee attack when playing Apex Legends rather than having to somewhat search for the key.3.The lighting zones on the mouse are really great and stand out at night while utilizing the mouse.4. Braided cables for me are always a plus.5. Adjustable weights make changing the CG a plus.6. The large skates make moving the mouse large distances effortless and drag free.7. Stiff side buttons, not a fan of mushy feeling buttons I like the resistance do I can feel the press.**Cons**1. Not a fan of the profile change buttons on the mouse behind the scroll wheel, I can see how they could be useful but when I setup my profile for a specific application or game I have no intention to switch it while using that application. To Corsairs credit however these buttons can be rebound and if you accidentally hit one of the profile switch buttons you can easily switch back by up or down shifting. I disable them while gaming.2. The lift off distance is an abomination making it rather difficult to remain on target when repositioning the mouse. There's no way to adjust this in iCue have to remove a star because of this as I feel it is a design flaw that should have been taken into consideration if the intended targets were gamers.Other than that like I've stated if you're coming from a G502 and looking for a slightly larger version of that then you will be at home with this mouse.",
          "liked it very much with the weight system",
          "This is my 8 month review of this mouse. When I built my first gaming rig I got a this mouse the corsair night sword and the razer deathadder 2. First couple of weeks I was leaning towards using the deathadder as it was simple to get used to out of the box and at first thought the DPI changing buttons to use on the fly seemed daunting and pretty \"big brain\" stuff to use. However. I quickly began to really love and favor this corsair mouse after months of use. First thing to mention I got some small hands \ud83d\ude21 so the deathadder didn't ever sit right in my hand. This corsair mouse feels really good in my hand. And one of all the thumb side pad is super satisfying to rest the weight of your hand on. It makes gliding around the mouse pad reallllyyy smooth. Lastly. The DPI buttons on the fly have grown to be my favorite feature of any mouse. I use it in 2 ways to warm up, you start at a lower dpi and adjust on the fly. Also when people are spectating you it is more satisfying for people to watch you play on a lower dpi so being able to lower it for your viewers is fun. The sniper button is amazing for long range tracing without completely tanking your dpi when you switch back to close combat situations.One more thing. The Corsair hub driver is amazing and super easy to use. You can easily sync the lights of the mouse with your motherboard and RAM lighting all in one spot. Highly recommend this mouse over any other mouse I have ever used.",
          "If you're looking for a mouse that's weighted, and has a similar ergonomic design compared to the G502, then you've come to the right place.The mouse is VERY similar to the G502. The only difference is, it is bigger by a noticeable amount. If you're a person with large hands, or you have a bear claw grip, this is a really good mouse for you. You might be worried about the profile buttons below the mouse wheel, and you're right to be. Depending on how you're holding the mouse, and how aggressively you roll your finger across it, you may end up hitting one of these buttons. It's not a huge issue, since Corsair's firmware, iCue, you can delete any additional profiles that come default with the mouse.A personal issue I have with the mouse is, the thumb mouse buttons are a little too jagged. I have to really hold the mouse in order to press the forward button (M5, if I'm not mistaken), which I tend to use relatively frequently when I'm surfing the web. Even if you're one of those gamers who utilize these buttons, you will have an extremely hard time pressing it, so I recommend not using it.Another issue is, if you're a fan of the G502's mouse wheel unlock, this mouse does not have it. A pity for sure, and a missed feature, personally, but that's when you can click the mouse wheel, and go further beyond.However, that's not to say the mouse itself is bad; I love it. The wheel clicking is solid, and the extra features on the mouse that mirror the G502 perfectly is a far superior version for sure.",
          "I bought this to replace a Logitech G502 Hero that I bought a couple of months ago (not going to get into specifics on the G502 since this is a review for the Corsair Nightsword, but I'll just say that the G502 didn't work for me because the buttons were too sensitive and causing me to unintentionally left/right click all the time just from resting my hand on the mouse).This mouse has everything I liked about the G502 (the shape, size, and general feel) without the sensitive clicking that the G502 had. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have the scroll wheel lock button that the G502 has, but I can deal with that. I've only been using the Nightsword for about a day now, but I'm very happy with it.The software works fairly well. I'm not huge on playing around with colors and generally just settle on a static white/light blue color on everything. My keyboard is a Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum (which I love), and I liked how I could manage both the G502 and the keyboard with the same software when they were both Logitech, but running Corsair's software for the mouse hasn't been a big deal. It works, and it's not obnoxious/annoying, so I can't really complain.The only con that I can list right now is that the rubber grips/surface tend to collect a lot of dust/dirt and such. Even though I've only had the mouse for about a day, I'm already seeing that. I've started keeping a can of compressed air and a small brush on my desk to clean this every so often.I'll update the review if anything changes after I've been using this mouse for a while, but so far, I'm very happy and feel like this was 70 bucks well spent.",
          "I bought this Corsair product to not only replace a wireless mouse that had button issues, but also because I have grown to really admire Corsair products. It feels very comfortable in my hand, and even though this one boasts more button options than my old one, I don't feel like I'm going to press anything unintentionally. The RGB lighting is a nice little upgrade for me and I like that I can use their ICUE software to customize many different things from lighting, button executions, pointer speed, etc. I also use a Corsair keyboard, headset, and RAM which are all accessible from the same software. So far, while gaming I have been very impressed and it makes me realize how having a high quality mouse makes such a difference. As much as I liked the convenience of a wireless mouse, I appreciate the fact that this being a wired mouse means I won't have to worry about charging/batteries etc. Overall, I really love this product so far and if this fits in your budget, go for it. Great product 10/10.",
          "Amazing mouse, fits my small baby hands perfectly, even though it's a big mouse. Glides very smoothly, but I bet that also depends on the surface under it. Works super well with Corsair\"s software, and I can have multiple very epic and funny gamer moments/clips.DPI is adjustable by single digit integers. You can have one, or 756, or 987 DPI if you really wanted.You can adjust the different lights on the mouse individually as well. Meaning you can have different settings for the logo, different settings for the back of the mouse, and different settings for the two front lights.I find myself using the big giant sniper button for all kinds of things. Since you can set macros on this mouse, I set a macro for baloons td6, as well as some editing macros on this thing.However...The cable isn't braided. It's sheathed. The sheathing is tearing off as I'm writing this, and I've had this for 4 months. So, be aware of the brittle sheathing.Other than that, not much to complain about. You get what you pay for, but hopefully next time, better sheathing."

          "I loved this mouse until after about six months when I would single click and the mouse would double click. I had to replace it. Too expensive to buy this mouse and have to replace it within a year. I do not recommend it.",
          "Dear Corsair,I purchased an M65 Pro from Amazon (not a third party seller on Amazon) back on August 20th, 2017. I have always purchased Corsair ram, peripherals, towers, and psus (unless Seasonic was cheaper :-) for every build I've assembled because I'm a fan. I don't read reviews, because I don't like cry babies and I trust the company's I support with my money will support me if I run into a problem. My mouse is roughly 8 months out of warranty and it has been incessantly registering two left clicks for every one that I input.I generally expect a product to perform twice as long as its warranty coverage. On the rare occasion that expectation isn't met, I consider the unit I received to have been on the bad end of the \"acceptable\" spectrum inherent to the industry of mass production; if it was the best unit in that spectrum then I would argue the product design to be poor.The m65 pro has a stated 2 year warranty and the left click switch that is giving me trouble is rated for 20,000,000 cycles. There are 1461 days in 4 years (the wear and tear time I expect out of this product); simple division of these figures shows the m65 LB can be clicked 13,689 times every single day. I can confidently and truthfully tell you that I don't click my mouse anywhere near that number; never mind the fact that it has only been 973 days which would allow for an ever higher daily cycle limit.I believe my expectations are entirely reasonable and I am naturally requesting a replacement m65 pro, despite it being outside of the stated warranty. It is my hope that a replacement will fill my current unit's void of remaining days, at which point I will gladly purchase a new Corsair replacement when necessary. I have included a screen shot of the Amazon invoice, and would like to participate in the advanced exchange program by providing my credit card and billing information assuming I am taken care of. Thank you very much for your time and consideration,Sincerely,xxxUpdate: They made a \"one time exception\" and shipped a refurb mouse that has had no issues; I will update when problems arise.",
          "I received it and it worked and felt very good! Accurate, fairly ergonomic button placement with the thumb naturally resting on the special firing button, with the metal weights underneath helping keep it stable and smooth on a mousepad. However, in less than a month the scroll wheel seems to have had its axle snap despite lack of aggressive use. The wheel itself ended up resting oddly inside of it, and is loose and unable to scroll or click, with research suggesting this may be a problem with other Corsair mice.Be careful buying and using this mouse, all that keeps the wheel functional is a very thin plastic cylinder.",
          "After 4 years it keeps being great mouse. I give it 4/5 because some random double clicks for button 4 and 5 and wheel feel to hard to click. If corsair address those issues, I will stick forever.",
          "I bought this mouse for my wife and it worked perfectly out of the box. Loved it so much decided to immediately order another one for myself.When I first received it, I was a bit discouraged because the scroll wheel exhibited the problem described by others where scrolling would cause pages to 'fight' back and jump the opposite direction by 1 or 2 lines. I figured this explained why the box was unsealed and had been previously returned, so my first thought was to return it. However, as others had reported the same issue and claimed success with certain fixes - I opted to do a little experimenting / troubleshooting and discovered the following (I liked the other aspects of the mouse so much I wasn't keen on waiting for a replacement).-Cleaned the scroll wheel sensor components with electrical (isopropyl alcohol) cleaner - issue persisted-Blasted compressed air into sensor mechanism with thorough bursts of 120psi - issue persisted-Jostled and wiggled various components to verify nothing was mechanically binding - issue persisted..and then the fix..-Dabbing silicone lubricant onto the sensor mechanism with a QTIP as described by a previous poster completely resolved the issue (yay!). I prefer silicone over WD40 as its cleaner, no smell, etc etc.So I think it is safe to say there is some tolerance not quite right in this mouse design/build, but the awesomeness of the mouse and the availability of a fix merits it 5 stars. Its been about a month and my mouse is still working. Hopefully frequent lubrication won't be needed, but I do not believe it will as I dabbed very little silicone lubricant into it which persists in strenuous conditions.As far as quality/features - haven't used many mice in my time but I always order the same meal if I like it, and in this case.. corsair delivers again. Mouse feels like a quality device being aluminum frame and having what seems to be the perfect weight/balance and button placement. Also has a nice texture on the sides to help with retention.. a micro/slight sandpaper feel. Corsair Software is slick - I've used it to disable all but 2 DPI selection settings as I don't need more than high or low.. considering the sniper button which drops it as 'momentary on' to whatever DPI you assign.Let me know if you have questions or desire encouragement.",
          "I love this mouse, when it works.  I love corsair and their hardware, but this is my second corsair mouse. Maybe even third?  I'm not sure, but every one has the same issue.  After a couple of years, the wheel doesn't click in, the back/forward buttons start double clicking.  Going to try a different vendor now.  Shame though, love corsair.  But as i said, for a couple of years, top notch mouse.",
          "Upon reviving this mouse, I took no time to grow used to it, and in turn I saw and instant improvement in my game. Corsair is an amazing company all around, and they\u2019ve created an equally amazing mouse. The main bragging right of this mouse is it\u2019s amazing 12K DPI sensor spite it\u2019s surprisingly low price, it\u2019s hard to find cut corners on this mouse, that\u2019s not to say that corners were not cut. On the buttom of the mouse there are two metal plates which sit just barely off the mousepad surface, these frequently dig in to the mousepad which I bought from Corsair, this makes the mouse very uncomfortable to use and these metal plates are not a one off mistake, I cross referenced my friend\u2019s mice and it was equally an issue. secondly, if buying this mouse for the RGB, this may not be the choice for you. The RGB zone in the front of the mouse doesn\u2019t mix at all leaving you with three separate lights that are clearly visible at the front of the mouse, the other RGB zone works perfectly but is often concealed by your hand, it also reflects down onto the table. Though my complaints, the iCue software which allows for versitle customization of various lighting patterns, DPI, bindings or even surface calibration. The sniper button, which sits right where your thumb would naturally rest is almost useless, however thanks to the iCue software mentioned earlyer it can be rebound to almost a mouse button 6 which can be used for bindings in games.All around, this is a great mouse for the price.",
          "My review is sooo late like 5 months after receiving this product, but here it is finally lolI've never bought a gaming accessory before, but I was interested in buying this mouse over some other options because it had a similar shape to the one I've been using that fit my hand nicely, and also because the old one's buttons were not responding to clicks as it did before. Just looking at this, I felt like I wouldn't have to adapt to a new equipment and fall back on my playing skills in games that demand precise aiming and whatnot, but it's exactly what I got anyway. It was significantly bigger and way heavier than I expected. I first found it hard to control this thing even after having removed all the weights on the bottom, but since I was working with a new piece of hardware, I just decided I would leave the weights on and just get stronger in my arms or something as I use it more. One thing that still strikes me weird is the sniper button which at first became a distraction because gripping it(I have a claw grip) lands my thumb on the button, pressing it every once in a while. And also for the fact that a lot of FPS games today have aiming sensitivity settings, which makes the sniper button more or less already obsolete. I remember feeling very regretful that I bought this mouse with an unusual button that kept getting in my way, but now having used it for 5 months, I'd say I have no complaints anymore now that I'm super used to it. May have took some time to adapt, but in the end it's still a great mouse.Overall, I think this mouse is 50/50 win or loss chance for whoever buys this mouse because of that darn sniper button. But if one is willing to commit to the time it takes to adapt to it, then this will be of little problem to experience.",
          "I switched from the Razer Death Adder V2 to this and so far it's been great, I got it in early January. My only problem has been that my pinkie finger tends to bend on it too much and kind of cramp but disregard that because I'm pretty sure that's just user error.",
          "Not much to say besides, this is the third time I bought this mouse, not because the product is bad, but I\u2019ve been using it for years even the older version of the same product. And eventually the wear and tear it just gets old or breaks because I\u2019ve used it for so much. However, I keep buying the same mouse because every other mouse I get just doesn\u2019t meet the hand feel of this one. I also switched from Consol so I put a lot of my bindings on the mouse buttons to give it a more controller  feel. And this one has easily the most accessible mouse buttons in my opinion for range of thumb motion. The Corsair software makes it super easy to put custom presets for your dpi so you can change with the click of a button from a moba/ mmo over to a shooter, etc. I only recommend this mouse over all others in existence",
          "Since I got into the high-end PC market about 2 years ago, I have been using exclusively Corsair peripherals and this mouse conforms to the same high standard that I have come to expect from their products.  I purchased this mouse because I needed a second mouse to replace a less-than-perfect cheap wireless mouse that was on its way out.  The other Corsair mouse that I use with my main desktop PC is the Corsair Sabre, so this review will be from the perspective of comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each offering.  In terms of comfort, I think that this mouse is a bit more comfortable to use than the Sabre.  Additionally, the buttons on this M65 are of higher quality and feel more responsive.  I particularly enjoy the concept of the sniper button, but in practice, I always forget about it and never end up using it in games.  It isn't all good for the M65, however.  The appearance of this mouse doesn't come close to that of the Sabre.  There are less RGB zones and the lighting colors are less accurate.  Additionally the red of the sniper button is super noticeable and sticks out in my primarily black/white/green setup.  Also to note is the fact that it does not glide very smoothly on my MM800 hard mousepad.  Luckily I will be using the M65 with my laptop with which I use a cloth pad instead, so this is not an issue.  Perhaps this will improve as the pads wear down over time.  Overall, this is a good mouse for what I was intending to use it for, which is mainly a backup or secondary mouse.  I would have a hard time recommending this over the Sabre though, especially considering that the Sabre is usually cheaper.  If you can find this mouse for $40 on sale like I did, you will not be disappointed.",
          "I've owned two of these since 11/2018 and I can gladly say these are the most ''mid'' mice I've used for gaming. They have good functionality when they are brand new, but it doesn't take long for the mouse buttons to double click constantly or become extremely sensitive, as well as the center scroll wheel breaking if you use the click function it has leaving the mouse wheel unusable. I currently have similar problems out of both mice without being any sort of competitive or high speed/use gamer/pc user.",
          "I like this mouse.  I use it for work and to play an occasional game.  I really like the slight click feel you get from the wheel.  I hate wheels that just glide with no discernable \"clicks\".  Removeable weights are nice.  Adjustable sensitivity is great.  Just very solid for only ~35$.",
          "Fabulous mouse, coupled with the icue software it does everything you could need. My last one lasted about 5 years, and honestly it probably woulda lasted longer if it didnt get dropped so often.",
          "This is one of the best mice I've ever had. I've been using it for the past three months, and will update my review as time goes on. I'll state what I found good and bad about this mouse.Pros:1) The LEDs in this mouse are fantastic. I've used a Logitech G502 Proteus Core in the past, and the way the light leaves a glow on the tabletop behind it is very nice. The lights in the front are nice too, though most of the time you won't notice them. The DPI light on the top is very clear and solid, no light bleeds through.2) The buttons are all very tactile. M1, M2, the DPI buttons, the forward and back button, and the sniper button are all very solid and they won't be accidentally pressed.3) The build quality is excellent. After three months of hard use nothing has broken or peeled off. Five stars here.4) Material quality is excellent as well. Not as bad as the rubber on the G502, but its has a really fine sandpaper texture. The construction of the mouse is well done as well, with the metal baseplate feeling very sturdy. The cable is braided, which is always nice, and the cable comes with a velcro strap to keep things tidy.5) Corsair Utility Software (CUE) is very nicely done. The program is very intuitive and changing colors, setting DPIs, and setting macros are very nice and is on par with Logitech's software.6) The box it comes in is very nice, the lid is held closed by magnets, and overall the product exudes quality. For the (when I bought it) 60$ mouse, the presentation is excellent.Cons:1) The scroll wheel isn't tilt, and doesn't have the free scroll that the G502 has. For someone who browses some long documents for school, it is a missed feature.2) The ergonomics of this mouse aren't the greatest. The back end tapers off a little too much, leaving my palm hanging. In addition, the sniper button is placed a little too far forwards, making it so that pressing it can be a pain. The other buttons are nicely placed though.3) The mouse is on the heavier side, even with the weights taken off.The M56 Pro is a very good mouse, up there with the G502. I do prefer it's sweeping lines compared to the angular G502. Many people have come up to me and complemented me on this mouse. There are some tradeoffs, but overall it is a great mouse and has become my daily driver.",
          "The Good:First impression right out of the box is WOW!!!!!  I just upgrade from the Steelseries WOW gaming mouse and this thing is beautiful.  Sadly that euphoria didn't last nearly long enough.  The weight was exactly what I was looking for and fitted my need perfectly, that being said, if it doesn't for you, there are 3 weights on the bottom that simply unscrew, making weight customization a breeze.  iCUE isn't exactly user friendly, but if you have even a general knowledge of computers and mice you shouldn't have any issues setting up your lighting, acceleration, DPI or double click speed.  There is also a surface calibration tool that I personally found extremely useful and once I calibrated my mouse, and got all the settings exactly to my standards I never (in 18 months) had to go back in and adjust the settings.  A definite plus in my book.The Bad:About 3 or 4 months into ownership I started to notice that when I was on the web and scrolling through a web page, the page would inadvertently start jumping around.  If I were to scroll down the page would scroll down then randomly jump back up, most time to a spot on the page higher than where I had started to scroll down from.  Frustrating to say the least, but to me not a deal breaker.  Afterall, I bought this mouse to play games not scroll the web.  So I dealt with it by becoming accustomed to clicking and grabbing the scroll bar on the web page versus using my scroll wheel.It get worse!!!about 9 months into ownership I started to notice that when I would try to lift and item in my bags (simple left click) and try to drag it to my stash, my mouse would actually double click the item and put it back into my bag and when I would start dragging the item, of course I was dragging nothing at all.  Frustrating at first, but as you progress through a game most items you loot are vendor trash or melted down for mats, so this becomes more or less an inconvenience and less of a total deal breaker, so I learned to deal with it.But Wait, There's More!!!!!Recently, now were talking 14 - 15 months into ownership, and dealing with all the aforementioned flaws, the right click button all of the sudden starts NOT acknowledging the fact that it is being depressed at all.  i.e.  When I am channeling a spell in game, by clicking and holding down the right mouse button.  The mouse will of its own accord, just randomly release the button for no reason.  Then I have to release the right click and quickly reclick and hold it to start channeling the spell over again.  This was the final straw!!!!!The UGLY:Navigating the Corsair web page just to find the page you need to begin the RMA request is nothing short of ridiculous.  Then once you finally find the page and fill out the request, if you're lucky you'll hear from them in 2 or 3 days.  And when you do hear from them they want your invoice (thank goodness Amazon keeps all your purchase history on your account page), the lot number of the mouse (SAVE YOUR BOX, thankfully I always do).  Once you provide them with all that information, you are at their mercy.  They got my money long ago, they certainly aren't in any hurry to rush me out another mouse, or even update the status of my RMA, so here I sit.  Waiting!!!!!  I certainly hope that when I do get my replacement mouse that Corsair has improved on their quality standards over the past 18 months or it will just stay in the box as an emergency back up.If you are one of the lucky ones who gets a defect free mouse, you will have you hands on a pretty amazing mouse in my opinion.  But before you click that \"add to cart\" button I suggest you google Corsair M65 Pro scroll wheel and Corsair M65 Pro double click issues.Good Luck with your purchase/researchScott",
          "I thought the sniper button would be cool but it's just an inconvenience, I kept hitting it on accident and couldn't get used to moving the mouse without pushing the button so I ended up turning it off. Also the mouse wheel failed after a few months, the rubber grip part that goes around is loose from the plastic wheel and moves independently, so sometimes it doesn't register when I spin it, and sometimes it registers a spin when I didn't move it. It's basically junk for what I need and will need to replace it already. Not very happy.",
          "When I first got this rodent, I was pleased. It felt OK under my hand, the few extra buttons were placed appropriately, and the lights weren't too bright or annoying.  You have to run the Cue software to make changes to the light color, which imposes a modest extra demand on your system resources. I haven't a way to prove it, but from watching the assorted things that start when I turn my system on, I'm confident enough that it has some telemetry functions in the Cue software, at least on startup. (If I learn that I'm wrong about that, I'll certainly amend this review accordingly.)  So, I've now had this rodent a while, long enough to offer a fair review. As noted, it worked great when I got it, and did so for several months. Then I began to notice that my scroll wheel in the middle sometimes didn't always scroll with the motion. Sometimes it lagged, sometimes giving me maybe one tick down when I'd rolled the wheel a lot further, sometimes nothing, and occasionally nearly perfect. It's inconsistent, basically, which makes it a dang nuisance. I'm an old man, retired, and I love to play PC games, built a very nice PC to do that. For games, you need the control this thing gave me. Now, while the buttons still work adequately, that scroll wheel failure couldn't be overcome. Nothing's been spilled on it, no food or liquids of any sort, I don't need that stuff anywhere near my PC or peripherals. I can't go in the thing to see what, if anything, I might be able to do about the problem, so last week I gave up, put it aside and bought a much better mouse. I paid more for it, but I got more for my money.  So, in total, I'd advise against getting one of these rodents, folks. If you want a really good rodent, expect to pay a lilbit more than this one costs. If you don't use your scroll wheel much, and don't mind software that transmits some stuff to somebody, it's an OK mouse. You can do better, and that's my recommendation. YMMV.  Added Jan. 2019: Well, the wife wanted this one, so after being certain she knew why I'm not using it, she took it. According to her, it's better than her old one. Of course, her old one sucks worse than this Corsair rodent. I just wanted to add that I've had to remove the animal fur that accumulates around the shaft the wheel spins on. This makes the wheel even more erratic and useless, but my wife has a great deal more patience than I do.  Dear reader, there are numerous better, cheaper rodents here on Amazone. You can do so much better than this POS.",
          "I purchased this mouse back in May.  I wanted to give this mouse some time to feel it out so that I just don't jump to conclusions about the product.  After about a 90 day trial period, these were my thoughts...The first 2 weeks after I received this mouse, I ended up having to call for a replacement.  I notified Amazon that the Left mouse button was sticking and some times wouldn't even allow me to click anything.  To the customer service that I dealt with through Amazon, they are the only reason I'm giving this mouse the 3 stars.  But as I'm sure, everyone is well aware but the \"Left Mouse Button\" is literally the most important button on a mouse.  Whether you're gaming or just browsing the internet you need that button...unless you wanted to go back old school and just use the keyboard to navigate through windows but then this review would be irrelevant because I wouldn't even need the mouse.  I'm a little upset with this mouse because I did hear good reviews from others that have used this mouse in the past.  I wouldn't say that this mouse is for everyone because it isn't.  This mouse is something that you might want to get a feel for and try it for 30 days.  But as my personal opinion, I've had 2 within 90 days and I intend to be looking for another gaming mouse real soon.Although the mouse was rather bulky, it was something I was able to get used to.  I didn't mind the weights on the bottom because I had the option to remove them if need be.  I did eventually remove the weights just to get a feel with the motion and I did like the feel without the weights.  I was kind of upset about the sniper button option.  If that button is a part of the mouse, the user should have that option to use or bind it just like any other button.  What I found out about the sniper option is that you have to go into the Cosair settings and bind it with another key if you wanted to use it.  You don't have the option to use it in-game settings because it's for \"aiming.\"  The forward and backwards mouse buttons are a little sensitive when you try to click on one and for those who have small hands, reaching your thumb up can be a little challenging.",
          "Bought it to replace my old corsair mouse. Works great, I wasn't sure about the weight thing but I think I now prefer a little heavier mouse.",
          "Great mouse, it's a replacement for one I already had.",
          "This mouse has a known issue where the scroll wheel will degrade, and won't scroll consistently anymore.  The connection gets unstable, and trying to scroll results in the inputs jumping around as if you were scrolling wildly up and down, or sometimes just scrolling the other way.  Works great for a year or two before that happens, and other than that, it's a great little mouse.  I've used mine for years despite the issue, it's almost annoying enough for me to get it replaced... just haven't yet.  Would recommend regardless, just make sure you get the product protection.",
          "This is my favorite mouse when it comes to how it fits my hand. I also really like the big side button because I just reprogram it to crouch most of the time lol. The only problem is that the left click is trash. It's already starting double clicking or just not clicking. This is my second m65 and the older model had the same issue but atleast it took longer to happen.",
          "I've owned this mouse for around 7 and a half months, and at about month 6 or so noticed double clicking issues that had been very intermittent. The issue didn't become troubling until the frequency had picked up by about month 7, at which point I started doing some deep dive troubleshooting. I made sure, through iCUE, that the Firmware of the mouse was up to date and tried it on two different machines (and on different USB ports), but still ran into the random double click.See, what would happen is I would go to click and then release but at the time of release the mouse would send another click. Since it was under warranty, I went ahead and reached out to Corsair support. Fortunately, this has been a pleasant experience thus far - I was offered the chance to send the mouse in under RMA, and I opted for the $60 hold to have a replacement shipped out beforehand. (I have my old Razer, but I'm so used to the feel of this mouse that I don't want to go back and forth between now and getting the replacement).I'm certain most people have received a 5-star product, I think its a shame that the clicker would breakdown like this - it is the first mouse I've ever owned to have done so. I still highly recommend it as an FPS mouse, and I'm still quite happy to have made the switch from Razer peripherals overall.",
          "I have been using this mouse for 5 years. I just bought a new one because I just recently built a new pc. This is a great gaming mouse and after 5 years it still works like it is brand new.",
          "Just got this product this Thursday, finally opened it on Friday. Review below.EDIT: Everything I said below is still true, however it doesn\u2019t work well when I play WoW. I\u2019ve tried everything (software reinstall, editing in the WoW cvar, etc) and it\u2019s still causing an issue. Every so often when I hold down both the mouse buttons to move in WoW it\u2019ll keep control over the camera even though I removed my fingers to stop moving. It won\u2019t move anything unless I do but it essentially holds the cursor down and I can move the camera with the mouse which isn\u2019t supposed to happen and doesn\u2019t with any other mice I\u2019ve used (hyperx Pulsefire FPS Pro, random 8$ mouse, utechsmart Venus) so it\u2019s strictly a problem with this mouse.It also feels like it acts against my Corsair k70 mk2 keyboard. Sometimes I\u2019ll use A and D to strafe while moving with the mouse and it feels like the movements work against each other, as in i won\u2019t be able to move with the keyboard while I\u2019m moving with the mouse which doesn\u2019t happen when I use any other mice.I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a double click issue which it definitely could be. There\u2019s a lot of complaints of that over on the Corsair forums and even here there\u2019s quite a few. I don\u2019t have these problems with any other mice I\u2019ve used or am currently using. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a problem with it in junction with the keyboard but it definitely impacts gameplay.Edit: This was an issue with the left click not responding/randomly stopping. It would stop responding when I was holding down both mouse buttons to move which is why i said it feels like it works against my Corsair keyboard, it doesn\u2019t but the keyboard takes over moving when the mouse button stops responding.Out of the box I noticed:1. It feels really damn good in my hand. My hands are 6.3 inches from palm to middle finder tip (I\u2019m short tho so big hands for my size)2. The side grips feel great. Feels like legit material and it\u2019s grippable while sweaty.3. Light\u2019s are beautiful.Disclaimer: I\u2019ve had this for one day so far and everything feels great. Feels good in games (WoW specifically). I\u2019ll be back in a few months to complete the review when I\u2019ve tested it out longer, this review is just for initial impressions.",
          "Good quality and performance",
          "PROS:Love the mouse \u2013 works great \u2013 feels great \u2013 slides nice smooth/stop on a dime.Trigger button is awesome/clicking all feels great no issues. Lights look amazing and can do a lot of light modes using software.Works GREAT with the NVIDIA SHIELD TV \u2013 I am playing OVERWATCH/CoD/WoW/GTA etc\u2026Using the NVIDIA SHIELD TV the default light on the mouse was yellow for logo and white for wheel. The ONLY way to change the color is by using software (But you cannot use the software on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV) I thought I was stuck with the ugly default colors but I found out how to change it to RED. Using a PC download the correct software for this mouse/ in the software I created a Mouse PROFILE named in NVIDIA SHIELD TV \u2013 then in the COLOR mode set it to STATIC and pick ONE color for everything  - you can even change color of the DPI then SAVE it to your mouse profile \u2013 Then plug mouse back into NVIDIA SHIELD TV and that static solid one color will stay \u2013 this seem to only work in STATIC MODE and for ONE color. Which meet my needs. Good enough for the NVIDIA SHIELD TV.Replaced my G502 as this was not working well with NVIDIA SHIELD TV.$50 price is rightCONS:Finger print \u2013 I notice mouse looks like it has finger print/oil when using it, even with washed/clean hands. Never notice this on my G502 \u2013 but not big deal.",
          "I paid $29.99 for this mouse and I love it. I chose this mouse over the Logitech G502 that has such a huge following for two simple reasons: price (only a saving of a few dollars though) and brand loyalty (my headset is Corsair and the build quality is fantastic, plus, they match now)Some people have reported faulty scroll wheels, but such is not my case. The shape of the scroll wheel is fantastic. It's wide and ever so slightly concave so your finger fits perfectly.I have smaller hands, and it fits perfectly. It was a bit large to get used to from a cheap mouse, but now I think it's ideal. If you have large hands it might be a bit cramped.The textured grip that others described as sandpapery is not nearly as off-putting as that sounds, it's enough to grip  without being so rough that it's annoying.iCUE software takes a little time to figure out but is very customizable. I've only really played around with the lighting options, though, because I found that the DPI increments were good enough as is. (Although I changed the light corresponding to my preferred DPI setting to match the main lights, from green I believe to purple)The sniper button is in a perfect position for my sized hands, my previous mouse had it positioned all the way at the front of the mouse for some reason.All in all, I recommend this mouse. Now, if only Corsair would make a mechanical TKL keyboard with brown switches...",
          "Corsair made a lot of good decisions in their update of the tried-and-true M65 model. I'll state the changes I saw between the M65 Vengeance (last mouse I used) and the M65 Pro.1. OLEDs in the logo and the mousewheel. They are absolutely gorgeous, easily the best implementation of LEDs I've seen on a mouse.2. They painted the aluminum metal chassis black to match the color of the plastic body. It is also beautiful, and a great little aesthetic choice by them. Similar look to the M45 Raptor3. They changed the sensor from a ADNS-9800 laser sensor to a PMW3360 optical sensor. Incase you are unaware, the 3360 is the non-exclusive version of the best optical sensor on the market, the 3366 (of g303 and g502 notable fame). For any serious gamer, this was an incredible change to see.4. They added a gritty texture to the side panels of the mouse, to allow for better gripping. It works as intended, and I frankly liked it alot. It may not be for everyone, however. I would describe it best as a well-done soft sandpaper texture. (No.. it will not make your fingers raw)5. They moved the sniper button from just-out-of-thumbs reach to right on top of your thumb. As in, in order to hold the mouse, your thumb WILL be on the button. This is the only change that I disagree with, as I did not want to use that button for my purposes. With that said, others may very well enjoy the ease of access for such a button. It took some getting used-to to be gripping a button like that at all times, but did not feel awkward after a couple hours.The weight of the mouse is adjustable by a total of 20 g, from ~140 g to ~120 g. IMO, the low-end is still too high by most \"serious\" gamer standards, but can absolutely be used and adapted to by anyone.The weight distribution of this mouse is great. No complaints there.The look is awesome, possibly the best-looking mouse I've ever seen.Sensor is state-of-the-art, and that's not hyperbole. the 3360 is the best available.All major clicks feel great. However, Corsair is not well-regarded in their click latency. AFAIK it's about 10 ms longer than a ec2-a control in numerous tests. 1/100 of a second is not a major deal, but it is worth noting.The shape is best-designed for primarily in the claw grip. It fits my hand well (I'm 19cm long and 11 cm wide)The length to width ratio is somewhere close to 1.35, which is not what most people are accustomed to in a mouse. It does take getting used to.The software provided by Corsair is top-notch.OVERALL, I would give this mouse a solid 9/10, and would recommend it to serious gamers looking to try something different.With that said, this mouse, in a M45 plastic body, (and at ~90 g instead of 120 g) with the sniper button moved back to its previous position, would warrant a 10/10.",
          "I might be jumping the gun since I just received my M65 today, but, I researched my gaming mouse optionsfor a while before buying the Corsair, and thus far, its performance and quality matches the superlative reviewsfor it vs. Razer and other more expensive options in the same category. Mouse speed was way fast butonce you download the Corsair software which is fast and easy, from their site, it's a snap to calibratethe mouse speed and performance and all other options. What a joy it is to have a weighted, balanced,tactile super-accurate mouse when you're coming from using a cheap, prosaic Logitech generic mouse thatI'd been using for the past 5 years or more. Which was fine, but if you are gonna get into flight sims. andgaming, in any way, it's much better to invest in something like the Corsair. Now I see the great advantageof upgrading to one of these gaming mice, my first. It's also more precise and accurate for day to dayweb and PC tasks as well. I wasn't sure about the wired action, but the cable is plenty long and sturdy,and you don't have to extend it much if you don't need to. Cable is extending from top left of the mouse.The Corsair software was fast to install and seems very easy to use, and NOT clunky which is a very good thing.My HP PC recognized the mouse instantly, so it was usable right away even without the software app.The lighting is impressive, attractive, and the design as far as ergonomics is fantastic. I tried it witha popular flight sim. app., and it was fine although you'd have to assign buttons to really use it that way,and it still wasn't as good as the Thrustmaster joystick but that's obvious, I'm sure. As an addendumto the joystick, it's amazing.  It has a reassuring weight to it and it's large, but not overly so.I'm not a hardcore gamer, just getting back into the gaming and sim. world, but I already feel the Corsair M65 was a sound and durable investment. For the price, I do not know how you could beat this mouse considering its quality, build, price point, and performance.This seems like a mouse that will last a while, though I suppose if one were using it for hours a day on demanding newgames like Call of Duty or whatnot, and really beating on it, it might wear out after a year or two, but I could be wrong.I am recommending it highly, it's just what I needed without spending $130 on a mouse not being a hardcore gamer yet,and it's impressing me right off the bat.",
          "Es buen mouse pero si tenes una mano peque\u00f1a mejor conseguir notro que sea mas grande",
          "Sniper button reduces dpi for mid game use, I find it to be a little forward to comfortably use regularly however I also find its placement makes it so I am not accidentally clicking it mid game so maybe it is by design.  I hate the first programmable button along the thumb rest area because I find myself accidently hitting it alot.  This sucks in windows because I have it at factory setting to use as a back button, have to change the macro because it is just in a bad place for my hand position.  Overall the mouse is above average with great push button dpi setting changes (with color changes so you know by sight as you cycle through them!) and nice color customization features if you are into that.  Not a lot of programmable buttons for MOBA style games but enough for FPS to include some melee macros or whatever you might need.UPDATE:  After 10 months of normal everyday business use and gaming use (mostly FPS) the left mouse button is starting to get spongey and has either not clicked at times or once in a while double clicked although this is more rare.  This obviously affects gaming so I am guessing the lifespan is not quite a year if you play games daily.  I have not found myself using the sniping button to reduce dpi often and really am thinking it is more of a novelty at this point.  I will be replacing the mouse soon, and while I will not buy this mouse again, I may try another Corsair product as overall their products are better built than the cheaper competitors.",
          "I have used a Logitech G9X for years at this point. There has never been anything similar to it that I could find that would fit my hand. This gets pretty close, although the weird button on the right-side instinctively makes me hold my thumb behind it so I don't hit it; even though it doesn't appear to do anything.All in all it is a suitable replacement for those with large hands, and seems to be built with quality material. Cannot beat the price either, with a good condition G9X going for $300+ on eBay.",
          "This mouse really reminds me of an upgraded Logitech G9 mouse. It's pretty similar.The \"sniper\" red button on the side for lowering the DPI for precision feels like a real big advantage; almost like it's cheating! I find this really useful for not just gaming, but also when you need that precision when using photoshop. Just release the button again to go back to the normal DPI.The scroll wheel has a nice thick rubber grip to it. (I wish it had a hyperscroll like Logitech, but it does not) Below the scroll wheel are buttons to increase/decrease DPI  (on default); I wish the center \"mode\" indicator could be a button too, but it's not.You can customize the 8 buttons (including left/right/center mouse click); left side button has the red sniper button, forward/back button, and center has increase/decrease DPI button.What I'm not a fan of is the weight adjustments screws. You need a coin to unscrew the bottom; it would have been nicer if they stepped it up and made it adjustable with it being completely tool-less, or at least have the tool built into the mouse, so you could easily remove it.  Also, once you remove the weights, it's a bit difficult to align the screw back into the hole. For someone only occasionally changing weights, this is fine. But for someone constantly needing to change weight adjustments, it can become a nuisance.The USB end is pretty thick.Pros:- Nice big red \"Sniper\" button on the side to quickly decrease DPI- Left/Right click has a matte grip finish- Feels good on the hands/wide grip; the weight plus grip also on the scroll wheel just feels secure and gives the feeling of being in control- Weight adjustments- RGB glow effects  (I wish there were two more on the front like headlights; that would have looked cool)- Very cool how you can synchronize the lighting with Corsair's keyboard- PriceCons:- Not a quick easy way to change weight adjustments; need to unscrew with coin (could use tool-less design or have tool built-in); must align screw to put back in- Software is not very intuitive- Wish the scroll wheel had RGB lighting around the ring like on the Corsair Sabre RGB (looks way nicer) and also the sniper button to have lightingIf you were a fan of the Logitech G9, then this can be a nice suped-up upgrade.",
          "I used to have a similar mouse but moved over to the RAT7. Honestly this doesn't compare to a RAT in terms of accuracy and feel, but it's definitely a contender for the price. After about a year my RAT died and I couldn't afford a new one, so I went cheap on a Mad Catz MMO TE and it was probably the worst mouse I've ever bought. Decided to buy a new mouse and my buddy recommended the Corsair M65 and honesly it's a great mouse, and it's definitely on the tier of the RAT7 as far as gaming mice go, but it's a fraction of the price.It's got a nice weight to it and I haven't has issues with accuracy. All the buttons can be mapped, even the DPI buttons. Unfortunately you don't see the colors much while you're using the mouse but it looks pretty when your computer is sitting there (if you care about that stuff). I've had some issues with the software for remapping and it takes a bit of time to figure out how to actually remap stuff. But it's plug and play with all functionality built in so you don't actually need the software if you don't care (the mouse will light up with the colors in the product picture by default though).The only issue I every have is when I have to make extremely small movements, like pixel for pixel. It could be my mousepad surface or the mouse itself but I can't get the mouse to make very slight adjustments without it jumping too far in either direction. This obviously doesn't matter unless you're doing graphic design or something, but I did notice it on a few occasions trying to snipe over long distances in several shooters (BF4,BF1,PUBG,etc.). Using the \"Sniper Button\" fixes this issue but it's awkward to hold with your thumb and be accurate, at least for me, so I guess it's a non issue if you're fine with that.It also shows dirt and grease pretty badly but if you clean your gear regularly that shouldn't be a problem.",
          "Good but not Perfect.For this review, I'll be comparing this mouse to the Logitech G502. I recently purchased both mice and have had a few weeks to use both. They are two of the most popular gaming mice on the market and direct competitors, so this comparison should prove useful for some.First off, this is the most beautiful mouse I've ever seen.  The build quality is incredible and a huge step above any mouse I've used before. The aluminum chassis, rubberized top and sandpaper-like sides make for an incredibly well crafted device. The switches have what I would consider elegant actuation, with good tactile feel that is smooth with a satisfying, muted click noise. The scroll wheel feels elegant as well, with a really nice rubber material and super smooth scrolling action. The LED implementation is also really nice, with a beautifully lit scroll wheel area and brilliant illumination on the back of the mouse. This mouse illuminates the mouse pad and just looks really great, with the option to cycle through the RGB colors or use static colors. In short, its the best built and best looking mouse I've seen, and possibly the best looking peripheral I've ever used- on par with Corsair's gorgeous keyboards. Compared to the G502, this mouse is a step above in build quality and looks.The tracking on this mouse is excellent. It contains a pixart 3360 sensor, regarded as the best optical sensor on the market. The tracking is extremely accurate. The G502 contains a 3366 (Logitech's variant of the same sensor), so they are very similar. Having said that, I do feel that the G502 is slightly more accurate and responsive. Its hard to articulate what the difference is, its more of a feel you get using both mice. The G502 just seems to track basically perfectly, whereas I did have slightly more trouble aiming with pinpoint accuracy with this mouse. In reality though, the difference would probably be imperceptible to most users.The location of the \"sniper button\" is right where your thumb would normally rest. This would present a problem, but the button does require decent actuation force, so I never found myself accidentally activating it while playing. I was able to lift the mouse just fine as well. I do like the location of the \"sniper button\" on the G502 a bit more, where its located just at the tip of your thumb. It totally prevents any accidental press of the button, and just felt a little more natural to me.Now we get to the main issue I have with this mouse, and the reason I deducted one star. The shape and weight of this mouse will not be for everyone. Its shorter than most mice, while also being a bit stocky and wide. I use a fingertip type grip where my palm sort of floats above the top surface of the mouse, so I didn't have much of an issue adapting to the shape. However for those with a true palm grip, I doubt they would find this mouse comfortable. I think its probably made mostly for claw grip, and probably most fingertip users will find it comfortable as well (such as myself). However in comparison to the G502, this M65 is decidedly less comfortable. The G502 fits me like a glove. I especially like the extended thumb rest on the G502, and I prefer the grippy textured sides to the sandpaper-like sides of this M65. Aiming and lifting just feels more natural on the G502 for me.The weight of this mouse is probably its major issue. It comes with 3 weights installed in the underside of the mouse, and its just plain heavy. With the weights installed, I found difficult in lifting the mouse without my fingers slipping, and quick wrist actions for aiming are a bit more difficult than on lighter mice. I find it interesting that a mouse marketed as an FPS mouse would be so heavy out of the box. I removed all 3 of the weights, and its definitely much better. The G502 is also considered a heavy mouse, but it comes without the weights installed. I think without weights, the M65 still feels slightly heavier than the G502. Its definitely something to keep in mind for people who prefer lighter mice. The mouse is just heavy, no getting around it.Other than the stock/short size and the weight, this mouse is incredible. It looks so elegant next to my Corsair K70 keyboard, and it just exudes a quality of build that I've never seen in a mouse before. Most mice are full of plastic, as the G502 is. The M65 will instantly impress you with how well its made and how great it looks. However, looks are not enough for me to recommend this mouse over the G502. I think the G502 is probably the best mouse I've ever used, even though it looks overly \"gamery\" and has a plasticy build quality. It just sports more cool features (free scroll wheel being my favorite) and is supremely comfortable. However for those of you who have owned Corsair mice in the past, or who prioritize looks over slightly better performance, the M65 Pro RGB is a wonderful mouse. I would consider it the second best mouse I've ever used, and this is coming from a loyal MX518 and G400 user.TL;DR:Pros: Great build quality, most beautiful mouse everCons: Odd shape and very heavy.",
          "Lets just get this out of the way right off the bat, 12K dpi is just silly. There is no need for it unless you intend on gaming on an 8K screen or higher. I use a the Max DPI setting with a very low overall sensitivity and the max polling rate of 1,000 Hz. These settings work for me and the mouse does an excellent job at gaming, productivity, and looking great.Gaming: It works well, the buttons are all crisp, the scroll wheel is crisp, the sniper button is a little useless but great for a weapon swap button (pistol for me), and it never does anything I dont want it to do. You cant go wrong here.Productivity: An excellent mouse for productivity. I use this extensively for Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor and all of the features that make it good for gaming make it excellent for 3D modeling. I use the extra buttons for mapping keyboard shortcuts for my most used functions, delete, line, circle, trim, multi-select, but do find myself wanting just two more buttons. Not enough to justify buying the Scimitar, but enough to bug me every now and then.Looks: It looks good and feels good. This doesnt matter all that much but is nice to have. The texture on the side panels is just a little rough to allow for good grip but no rough enough so that it is abrasive. I honestly didnt notice it for a week or so. It is really the perfect texture.Value: Really an excellent value, $50 is not that much to spend on such a vital peripheral for all things and is really well spent here.. It doesn't take a gamer to appreciate it's values and I have indded converted those in my office to all use m65 mice for their modeling stations as well. The software is a little difficult to get into but once you get it everything comes fairly easily and allows all the customization you could ever want. The mode switcher function is really the killer function to have, I switch from three custom modes all the time, Browsing, SolidWorks, Inventor, and Game. They all have different lighting so I know which one I am in at which time.If you are looking to upgrade your mouse you cant go wrong here. Between its generally productivity enhancement, proper performance and movement tracking, and generally good value it is really the whole package.(But it could use two more buttons)",
          "I'm just trying to control the lights on my Corsair mouse, and it takes more processing power than getting the apollo rocket to the moon.The actual problem with this is the only way to turn off (or change) the lighting effects is to install their bloatware - The program called \"Corsair iCUE\".How is this program bloatware? You can check yourself.  'Compressed' to a 1.5 GIGABYTE download.When it runs it takes up 3-5% of my Intel Core i9-13980HX just passively in the background.Takeaway from all this? OPTIMIZE YOUR DRIVERS CORSAIR.",
          "For how expensive this mouse is it better be perfect.  It is not even close.  But I will go over the pros first.Pros:- There are weights on the bottom that are easily adjustable- There is a quick resolution button for \"sniper\" mode at the thumb- There is a neat RGB LED under a Corsair logo on the back and one more LED in the front near the cordNow the cons.  I was caught off guard by two major flaws.Cons:- The middle mouse wheel is horrible.  Get a different mouse.  It's not fair to say that without backing it up with some information.  Here is that information.  It is the type of mouse wheel that registers clicks rather than just freely spins.  That's okay with me since I prefer that kind but there isn't a switch to go back and forth between clicks and free spin.  Again, I'm okay with that.  Some may not be.  The real problem is with how this wheel \"registers ticks\" while it spins.  It doesn't.  Sometimes you click it once and it does nothing.  Then you click it again and it does nothing.  Then you click it again and it does the first two, the current and the next tick.  For example, you use your mouse wheel to switch through your hot keys in any first person game.  You try to switch up one weapon or item.  Nothing.  You try again.  Nothing.  You try again.  You jump five items.  You back up.  It jumps down two items.  Worst. Performing. Mouse wheel. Ever.This is by far enough of a reason to just forget this mouse right now.- The warranty is too short and the mouse does not last.  I understand that 1 year is standard for mice and peripherals in general.  However, if you are going to charge this much and make a \"premium\" product then it should also be made with good components that can and will last longer.  Or, if there isn't a component that can last due to the nature of the part allow for a user replaceable design.  Just outside of the warranty my previous generation M65's left mouse button wore out.  It started to register double and triple clicks with just one depression.  This means it also started to randomly not allow click and hold.  Very frustrating.  I think 60 bucks for a disposal mouse is absolute robbery.  I opened it up, found the button, googled the part number, ordered a new one, desoldered the old button and put a new one on.  The repair was very easy.  The part number is D2FC-F-7N(20M) and it appears to be used in a number of gaming mice.  If you encounter this issue do not throw more money at this company.  Don't bother with their support either.  They are completely unhelpful for information on tear-down or part numbers.- Their software must be running for the RGB functionality of the mouse to work.  The mouse doesn't have an onboard chip to control the light.  Instead it (probably. I didn't bother getting the oscilloscope out) relies on serial communication from the software to update the color frequency constantly.  This was disappointing because I never like any feature of any product to require another software to run on my computer.  A micro-controller capable of updating two single RGB LEDs could have been included for 25 cents or less.  Their software could have easily just sent an updated firmware to the mouse or programmed the firmware of the LED controller instead of having to be loaded all the time.  Disappointing.- This is just a minor annoyance but this thing shows grease in a very annoying way.  It has a matte finish essentially.  Even dry skin has oil on it and it will eventually accumulate on the surface of this mouse in an ugly way causing you to periodically clean it.  You don't notice this on a light colored mouse or a mouse with a semi-gloss or glossy finish.Overall, I hate this mouse.  If I hadn't bought it from Amazon I would have returned it.  Non-prime returns are such a hassle and I won't pay for prime when there are plenty of other companies out there with the same or near the same price and will ship for free.  I don't normally rate low but this mouse (especially through Amazon) has been one of my worst consumer experiences ever.  (Amazon would not price match or refund a 10 dollar price drop the day after I ordered.  They wouldn't cancel the order because it said it was packaging even though it took another week to ship.  They would not do a return without taking off 8 dollars for the shipping label.  Shame on Amazon.)",
          "I purchased the earlier version of this mouse back on March 4, 2014 (it was called the Corsair Vengeance M65 Performance FPS Gaming Mouse). The scroll wheel started acting up just within the last month - when gaming, it was becoming too inaccurate, and web pages were going in the opposite direction; the scroll wheel had lost it's accuracy and was skittery, and I figured it was time for an update. This one seems to have retained the sturdiness , comfort, and basic design with a few changes: instead of bars of light noting which sensitivity level was activated, it has a small bullseye light that changes color. The logo glows now, and isn't just painted on (which halfway wore off on my old one).Here's hoping this one perseveres as well. It's too bad I couldn't have fixed the old one, but in the age of disposable electronics and built-in obsolescence, I'm gad it lasted as long as it did!",
          "For the price of this mouse, and from my previous positive experiences with Corsair products, I was very disappointed. Pretty much every area of this mouse disappointed me.Upon opening the box, which was admittedly a pretty nice presentation, I plugged in the mouse, downloaded the software, updated the firmware, and set up my DPI and color options. I was immediately struck by how unnoticeable the LEDs around the scroll wheel were. You have to pretty much look straight down at it to see that they're even lit up. Not a huge deal, especially since it also had the LED on the back logo and a kind of \"underglow\" beneath that. The color options were pretty extensive, though everything else I have is red so I just set all the LEDs to red to match.Mouse all set up, with only a minor disappointment in the LEDs, I was ready to game with it. I fire up Counter-Strike Global Offensive and notice I have really bad lag. My fps was very high (~200 range) and my ping was low (~20 range), but I'd keep getting bad lag spikes every few seconds, making the game completely unplayable. I tried resetting the computer to no avail. After much trouble shooting with my internet connection I tried exiting the Corsair software. I immediately noticed that the mouse lost all it's settings, reverting to stock DPI and color options. But just to see I went back into Counter-Strike and the lag was completely gone. I can not, for the life of me, figure out what the mouse software would be doing that would make my game lag like that. I tried changing all kinds of settings in Counter-Strike to get it to run well with the mouse software running and was unable to do so. Ok, so just don't run the software. After all, my seven year old Logitech G9x can save DPI and color settings to the mouse itself, so surely this can\u2026 right?Apparently not. Supposedly color settings, and only color settings, can be saved to the mouse, although this did not work for me. There is an option in the software to save the settings to the mouse, but for me this did nothing, the colors and dpi immediately reverting to stock right when the software is closed. After hours of research and frustration the best I could do was download some older software that didn\u2019t cause any lag issues, though saving settings to the mouse still didn\u2019t work with that. After digging through many threads it seemed as though on older firmware this option did work, at least for the colors. I was unable to find a download for this firmware, so I decided as a last resort to open a ticket with Corsair to see if there was anything I could do to fix this problem or if they could provide me with older firmware. After a few days I got a response. I logged on with skeptical hope there may be an answer, only to see the response \u201cThis mouse could never save the DPI to device memory. It can only save static lighting setting.\u201dOf course I could settle and run the older software at all times to keep my color and DPI settings, but I really don\u2019t like running extra things in the background all the time and, maybe it\u2019s just me, but I don\u2019t feel like I should have to settle for a mediocre experience with a $60 mouse.I bought this mouse because I have a Corsair K70 keyboard which I've been very happy with and because I thought I'd prefer an optical mouse over laser for Counter-Strike, but this is not worth the time or money I spent on it. It has been returned.",
          "I'm a Windows user that does everything from browsing, website management, programming and gaming.  I've used and tested a lot of mice, Anker, Steelseries, Logitech, etc.  A couple years ago, I purchase a Corsair M65 and learned to love it. The size and weight was perfect for me, even though the software left a lot to be desired. Right at the end of its warranty, the middle (scroll wheel) button started requiring multiple clicks to register.I've tried a lot of other mice and my search kept bringing me back to the Corsair M65. The price for a premium mouse made the Corsair M65 Pro RGG a deal I could not pass on.Once the software was downloaded, it installed flawlessly (Win10) and I was quickly up and running.  Setting up a couple of profiles took a little bit of testing to figure out the CUE software, but not difficult to do some basics.  The surface calibration was a nice added feature that was not available in the old version; a plus.The buttons seem well placed and easy to get too without accidently clicking them.  If you like to grip your mouse tightly with your thumb and pinky, you might accidently click the sniper button, but that is not a problem for myself and like it where it is located.Likes: \u2022 Same size and shape as old M65. \u2022 CUE software is an improvement over previous M65 version and very powerful. \u2022 The CUE software allows profiles to match different programs +! Easily switching between \u2022 Colors -- I don't really need them and suspect I will have moths flying around my mouse this summer -- but it is pretty. \u2022 Sniper button has been moved back a small amount and rests right below my thumb for easier access (compared to the original M65, which required a bit of a \"reach\" to press). \u2022 The optical sensor seems to be spot on and it works well for BF4. \u2022 The size fits a larger / wider hand; just like the original M65. I suspect smaller hands would not handle this mouse very well.Dislikes: \u2022 Mouse is cranky on wakeup from the lock screen (Win10). It takes a few seconds for it to start tracking correctly. Several people have noted this on the support forum with no responses from Corsair. \u2022 My past experience with Corsair indicates that software updates to their software is almost non-existent; unless there is something drastic that effects the majority of owners. \u2022 Mouse weights are easy to remove, however, placing the screws back on without the weights is an act of futility. Without the weight in the hole, it is difficult to line up the small screw tip. Suggestion to Corsair, make a plastic lightweight weight to help line up the screw head (it's really easy to screw it back on with the weight installed.) \u2022 While the CUE software is an improvement, it is pretty complex and takes some time to  learn it. If you only use a few keystroke replacements, all of the other macros and stuff can get in the way of an easy user experience.Other Thoughts: \u2022 I hope the scroll button holds up better than my old M65. It stopped working right at the end of the warranty (2 years).I'd give it a 5 star review if CUE software was easier to use and I was not experiencing the \"cranky\" startup from the lock screen (which Corsair does not seem concerned about).",
          "I am a jazz piano player that likes to play video games. Since I've played piano from a young age, I grew into abnormally large hands.Not freak-show level big, but big enough to make mice shopping a pain in the butt.I had a Steelseries Sensei that served me well have its last day not too long ago, and since then I've had to find mice my fit. Mice supposedly designed for large hands, the Logitech G502 Proteus and Razer Deathadder, both didn't meet my expectations. In fairness the Deathadder wasn't small as much as it was not form-fitting. The G502 was usable but it had a hideous drag on my Steelseries Qck mousepad, even after I cleaned all the dust off.I prepared a bunch of pictures for you folks as reference, which I wish I had when shopping for mice, but my phone won't sync with my laptop so I'l just describe my hands as a little over 8 inches long and 4.5 inches wide. My fingers are even longer than my palms are large, with my middle finger clocking in at 4.25 inches long. I also use a palm grip by nature, meaning I really, really need a big mouse.To be perfectly honest, this mouse still isn't quite big enough. When I pulled it out I was heartbroken considering I've returned two mice in the past couple of weeks, as it's quite short. Because of this, the bottom of my palm drags on the mousepad, something I was hoping wouldn't happen. It's very wide, but my pinky and ring finger have to huddle up to fit on the thing. The arch of my palm is also slightly raised, meaning I can't do a true palm grip on this puppy. If it was just extended an inch and a half or two in the back I would be in love. I don't have any use for the sniper button on the thumb, so I don't like accidentally clicking it. I'd rather it not be there at all, but accidental clicks aren't common so I'm not too upset.Now the positives: The quality, the quality, the quality. The mouse wheel feels so sturdy, and the clicks are sooo sweet. The mouse sides are textured while the top is as smooth as silk. The RGB has a light mute, which I like. It's highly customizable; you can make it pulse, static, do whatever with whatever color. The DPI switch is neat, never seen it done that way. Instead of one button that swaps between profiles, you have two that scroll between several profiles. Haven't messed with 'em, but I like the defaults. The software was very easy to manage, by the way. This glides very well on the Steelseries Qck, even with dust. And it's cheap! Amazed with the quality for the price. It has a braided cable, and the USB plug actually looks pretty cool. I won't hide this one on the back of my case.I cannot speak for durability as I just got it. I hope it holds up when I drop it (which will inevitably happen) and to time. Other reviewers said it was sturdy so, it probably will.Very happy after 2 weeks I can finally use a mouse again. It's not perfect for my big hands but it's usable. I'm not sure any mouse will ever be perfect, so I'm happy. High quality. If you have normal people hands I'm sure you'll love it.Edit: It's been about a year and I just felt like updating. My M65 still looks brand new, hasn't experienced any wear at all. I think I've dropped it a few times but there's no scratches and it still performs beautifully. This is, as far as my gaming setup goes, the best purchase I've ever made.",
          "PROS: built quality is great, great software support, and it is excellent for gaming I really love the sniper button it helps a lot during game sessions, CONS: I have small hands and this mouse is a little big for me but functionality-wise is excellent.",
          "I just purchased this mouse solely to get that additional thumb button I need for Mass Effect Andromeda multiplayer.  MEA defaults the middle button (roller press) to dodge, and I'm leaving it that way, but that means I no longer have a separate button for each of my 3 skills on my old mouse.  This sniper button looks like it will work perfectly for that.  And it does once you make a profile in the Corsair mouse software to use it as numeric key 1,2,3 depending on your button preference (I use it for 1).The only downsides I have seen are:1.  The software that comes with the mouse to manage the lights and profiles basically does not run right if you have ASUS GPU software TweakUI installed.  I have a GSX1080 graphics card from ASUS and use their control software to switch profiles for more aggressive overclocking.  If this is running, then you basically cannot use the Corsair software.  Fortunately it seems I can just kill the ASUS software when I need to setup a mouse profile, and then after closing the Corsair software restart the ASUS software and the mouse seems fine with it.  So once you know to turn off ASUS TweakUI while using the Corsair software then it's fine.2.  When running around in multiplayer battles I lose my grip on this mouse.  If you've ever been serious into FPS you start to realize you need low sensitivity on your mouse to get those moving headshots consistent, especially if you like to snipe.  Doing so however, is how those pro gamers you see end up with those two foot mouse pads.  Even with those, I've seen many needing to lift the mouse off the pad to get themselves turned around because their sensitivity is so low you cannot do it with just the length of the 2 foot pad. MEA is not that demanding, but my pad is smaller and I need to lift the mouse and move it around quite abruptly while playing.  I am finding my hands cannot find good enough grip to do that at speed without accidentally pressing the near thumb button (which clicks too easily) or slipping out of my grip.  This issue probably only affects a few players but right now I'd love a mouse of this quality with 3rd button that I can fly around my pad without feeling like I need to use gorilla snot or rig up a velcro strap or something.  Just saying...  If that is not your concern then you will probably love this mouse.  It feels well built.  If you are a low sensitivity FPS player then tell me what mouse to get, because I don't know.  My previous mouse was easier to grip (Logitec g9x).  I definitely like the 3rd button though and have ordered gorilla snot ;) (drummers use it on their sticks for grip)",
          "I like the simplicity, how it looks, the heavy solid feels, the material, and the software.",
          "This is my second Corsair M65, overall I like the weight of the mouse, feels solid and stable. But like all mouses I've used from different brands, the first thing is break or not work as well is the scroll wheel, but the Cosair ones last longer than most mouses I've used so far. Not the mention the price is cheaper compared to Razer.",
          "I purchase this mouse to replace my old M65 which I had been using for 4 to 5 years already. Just like the previous model, the mouse is built to last with strong and durable materials. One of the major gripes I had in the previous model was the application of the glide pads where it started to peel away and affect my mouse movements. This required me to slice off the peeling part of the pad and eventually I lost an entire section and another half of one.This mouse however shouldn't suffer from this problem as the edges of the pads aren't as sharp and are instead curving down slightly. Another thing to note is that just like the previous model it is an excellent gaming mouse now with a better sensor. I am a person that loves to use low sensitivities for gaming due to the accuracy improvements and having this sensor perfectly track my arm motion is nice.The only real problem I have with this mouse is that the macros can take a bit of tweaking until you figure out how to do them. Another is that occasionally the left mouse click will keep on holding down until I press it again. I don't know why this is happening but possibly may be because I apply a lot of force when clicking. (Holding down very firmly). This problem does not occur very often though, probably less than once a month.Other than that, great mouse!",
          "After using this for about two days, my wrist is feeling a little sore due to weight, not muscle sore, more like pinging a nerve when using it. My previous mouse is standard MS mouse and no issues. Here's my initial quick impressions:Pro1. Quality \"tacky/grippy\" feel.2. Aluminum body.3. Rubber wheel feels great and smooth.4. Very accurate mouse movement.Cons:1. Heavier than expected, but removing the weights does really help.2. Lights can't be turned off with a button in the CUE software, but you can set the color to be black which is effectively turning the light off in a round-about manner.3. Awkard tail. I'm getting use to it, but really, there's no need for that type of design, stick to the standard natural feeling comfort format of a standard palm mouse but use the Aluminum body.Other:I'm a Mouse Picker Upper. I have 4 screens and picking it up is essential for my mouse movements to jump around, and due to the weight, it makes it that much more unnatural to do; however, removing the installed weights brings the weight of the mouse closer to that of a standard mouse. After putting in and taking back out the weights, there is a difference I'm feeling, I prefer it without and the difference while perceptible to my MS Mouse, is not enough to keep me from using it for everyday tasks, just wish it had a standard palm grip ;)What would be ideal, is to take the standard Microsoft mouse, add some fancy lighting, changeable DPI and use an Aluminum body. Sort of like the RGB saber from Corsair, but more in the line of the standard Microsoft mouse design with high-end premium quality materials.UPDATE: After removing the weights and using it \"weightless\" for a day, my wrist is no longer nerve pinging and I'm beginning to enjoy it."

          "I've bought the elite version of this and the standard version of this and tbh, just get the cheaper one because they're the same. But I have purchased other mice that are in everybody top 5 or top 10 online and for some reason the crappy Razer Naga mouse series is always at the top of everybody's list of MMO mouses and I'm not sure why. The only other one that stands up to it is the G600 from Logitech and any other that are knockoffs that have the exact same design.  The reason that this mouse is the best mouse of all MMO mouses is because of the grip on the side with the programmable buttons. The sliding adjustment is not really important as you will likely keep it in the original position from the factory which is all the way to the back. If you try any other design other than the G600 and, most favorably, this mouse design, then you will feel as if you cannot hold on to the mouse if you need to lift it off of the mousepad. With the Naga in particular you will try and pick it up and will have to be extra careful to not press all of the buttons on the side, much less just drop it entirely. It's because there is no indentation or curvature to the programmable button side of the mouse. However, this scimitar does have that curvature and also has textured buttons that help in grabbing the mouse when you need to lift up and adjust it. You may think that you won't need to lift up the mouse while surfing the web or playing a game but if you start paying attention, you will notice that you DEFINITELY do that and it is very important to have a ergonomic mouse - at least as far as palm grip mouse users are concerned. I have bought several to use at work and at home and 1 that quit working on me after a few years.ICUE SOFTWAREYeah iCue software blows. It appears to cause issues like a virus on your PC. It makes your mouse move slow and laggy like you're being swarmed by a virus and if you have a profile saved to your mouse and iCue launches, it overrides your profile for some reason and you have to shut down iCue to make it work normally. Best thing to do is to install iCue just to set your dpi profiles and color code them if you want, like I do, and then uninstall the program after saving the profile to the mouse. This.Program.Sucks.Period.",

          "I'm coming close to a year and a half of using this mouse now. Within a month of my initial purchase, the scroll wheel stopped working entirely, however I replaced it with the warranty and the process was super quick and smooth. Definitely one of the best return processes I've dealt with it, and had this not been the case I probably would've been tearing my hair out.Since I got my replacement, I haven't noticed any issues within the year+ of regular use both for casual scrolling and gaming. I have relatively small hands and the mouse fits perfectly and uses comfortably. The button bundle can be moved forwards or backwards depending on what's comfortable for you, a feature you probably won't tap into past your initial set up. The buttons themselves are solid, they have a combo of smooth and tactile patterns with small clicks for feedback.There are a lot of complaints about ICUE, the software that Corsair products use, but I've never had any issues with it personally. My main if only complaint on it is that for changing the binding of keys like the buttons under the scroll wheel or 12 button panel is a little tricky and annoying, definitely more difficult to navigate than Razer. I wouldn't say failing to be perfectly user friendly makes it unusable or worth downgrading the value of the mouse, though.All and all, I would say this is a pretty solid product but there is a chance you'll get unlucky, as the scroll wheel issue I had doesn't seem to be the only possible issue to run into. I do hope Corsair updates this model and fixes the main issues, since between the Razer Nagas and the Corsair Scimitar, I definitely prefer the Scimitar and MMO mouse options are pretty limited. If you're willing to risk it, the Scimitar is an overall solid choice and if something does happen, you can expect good customer support and a fast replacement.",
          "The mouse itself is great. It feels good in the hand and the adjustable keypad is very convenient.  The only issue that I have with the mouse itself is that the scroll wheel does not operate like a back and forward button (no left / right movement).  But that is a minor gripe when coming from the logitech G600.  I do like that you can see the DPI via the color of the LED at the thumb, that is a nice feature.The single biggest failure of the mouse is the iCUE software.  Now to start off I have used iCUE for awhile now, I have a corsair keyboard and LED fans, so I do use the software quite a bit.  But for whatever reason they made the mouse interactions extremely dumb. Everything from needing to manually program every button in the default profile (because why would you want to use the number keys?) to the hardware profiles not really saving (if they save they are corrupt and get reset when you start iCUE again).Every time that my screen locks, I lose access to the number keys.  This would be helpful for signing into my desktop, but not the end of the world. The real annoying part is when you do login the profile that should be loaded on to the mouse gets loaded, due to the way the communication protocol works for USB devices the mouse itself goes unresponsive for a few seconds.All that being said, I think my biggest problem with the iCUE software is that profiles are completely isolated and do not have any sort of stacking.  Not really a big issue if you are only using a mouse or keyboard.  Kinda a big issue when you have multiple devices and LEDs being controlled by the software.  Ultimately if you hit the change profile button on the mouse (and you will, a lot), you go to a blank profile that basically turns everything off.  Overall the software is not well thought out and not user friendly.Mouse: 9/10iCUE Software: 0/10",
          "For the price point, I expect flawless operation for several years. I guess I got that. I purchased it in 2019, and use it both for gaming and use the extra buttons for macros in apps like Photoshop. The left click is starting to double-click at random times, the RGB is failing in the number pad so it isn't quite the same color as the rest, and some of the numbers have rubbed off from use because these buttons aren't back-etched. With those things out of the way, the mouse has served me well, it's still super-responsive in all the games I play and has been a boon for my productivity. Overall, I'm not too mad, but wish it wasn't becoming eWaste so quickly. Perhaps a 5-year lifetime before issues would be better? I don't think I'll get another Corsair mouse, however, I'm looking to simplify things, and go with a real workhorse.",

          "Update 2nd sample: RMB lost tactile feedback, no springiness, no click, and it now intermittent.  This one in less than a year.  If I keep buying them (I *won't*), they'll begin failing 1 day after the amazon return period.The bad:1)  The driver was unacceptably slow.  I had to use onboard profiles to prevent lag.  The onboard profiles worked fine, but shouldn't've been needed and were a PITA to use.  This is why gaming gets 3 stars.2) After two years, the wheel button stopped clicking.  Not 20M clicks like they advertise.  I'm going to press them for a fix/exchange, even though it's OOW.  Let's see how their dedication to their customers is.  Anyone else with buttons failing before 20M which is ~1 click/sec 8hrs/365days, which might be a reasonable estimate, should ping them too.  DooM Eternal has increased my click count ;->3) The wheel rotation has worked flawlessly.  Maybe the narrowing is like a detent to prevent the axle from sliding out of the wheel?  I haven't seen the mechanism, so I'm talking out of my methane port.  Or a SWAG to be polite.In general, it fit my hand well, the adjustable button pad was a great idea and I never accidentally hit two buttons at the same time --  Unlike my new Razer Trinity, which, among other issues, is going back.TL;DRI wish someone would make a side button pad where the buttons are in an arc since that's how the thumb moves -- albeit a very slight arc.It, like almost every other mouse, is too slippery.  Why manufacturers think we don't want to pick up a mouse, especially a gaming mouse is beyond me.  This one does have a textured grip.  Right where my mighty pinky can grip it.  But I need to apply pressure with my thumb, thus clicking random buttons.I use it for FPS/TPS/etc like games.  Having things on the mouse means I very seldom need to move off the movement keys, so I may use the mouse a little differently, clicking and lifting more often.  Plus, many years ago someone suggested putting \"jump\" on RMB so I do use that a lot.  Not as much as LMB, tho.Now that it broke, IMO, too soon given what was promised, as opposed to what is warrantied I'm going to replace it with a different manufacturer's product.** Big question:  Has anyone seen a 5 star mouse, or better anyone who has *used* what they consider a 5 startmouse like this?

          "In my experience with this mouse, there isn't anything 'wrong' per say. It works as it should, icue is icue and the adjustable side key pad is a nice feature. In my opinion, there's just to much going on in the side num pad for it to be truly effective. There's no real tactile reference to let you feel what button is where and more times than not I'm glancing to it to make sure I'm hitting the right button. Simplest fix to this would be to add raised reference bumps on certain keys so you know where you're at without having to look.",
          "Compared to the Razor Naga, this mouse is much much better. Not only does ICUE actually work in detecting your Corsair items, the mouse also feels good to hold and also great to play with. It was a little hard to figure out how to remap they keys, but after looking at a few tutorials it became very clear and easy if you find the right tutorials that show you how to use ICUE 4. The mouse also feels more matte than others so if you have sweaty hands like me it will prevent it from slipping out as much.",
          "While the product packaging was in okay shape and complete the product itself had seen cleaner days. After a bit of cleaning it works great and seems like a product I would buy again. Though I doubt I'll be buying anything from Amazon Warehouse anytime soon again.",
          "Best mmo mouse for macros hotkeys etc",
          "I got this to replace a razer basilisk v2. The previous mouse was great but i wanted more options for macros. This has done great in that regard. The only issue ive had with this mouse is remebering what i bound all the buttons too!  Being able to slide the additional buttons forward and back for confort was fantastic. I was able to position it in such a way that i was able to hit them all. If you want a lot of buttons for mmo or other games i can definitely reccomend this one.",
          "Good mouse all around, but the side buttons have to be set up manually in Corsair's proprietary software. The setup is confusing enough that I had to search for youtube tutorials, and it would be great if that could work out of the box.",
          "I absolute love my Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite... The customization and the side buttons are great for playing MMOs. the buttons are clicky and responsive, and I find that the wired nature of it actually makes it much more reliable.I would caution anyone who has large hands, though. I have large hands, and like most gaming mice, this feels small... But, there aren't many options out there for us big handed people in the MMO mouse market, so for me, this was my best option.The software already went with my Corsair headset, so using iCue was a good idea for me to begin with as well. I avoided less reputable brands for a mouse like this because of the necessity to install their software on my computer. iCue has always worked well on my PC.Overall, if you're playing MMOs, highly recommend.",
          "I bought this first before buying a Razer Naga Pro. For the cost, the Corsair isn't a bad mouse, but I would 100% recommend trying one out in person first.I have smaller hands for a guy (sad), and I tend to grip the mouse with my ring and thumb a bit more. I made so many mis-clicks on the right click with this mouse it drove me insane. I can only assume it's because of my grip or how I rest my hand on the mouse, but it was annoying enough to make me look for another alternative. Definitely try one out if you can and see if it works.The required software is _bad_. It's extremely confusing to assign keys (for some reason there are two categories of keybindings, \"virtual\" keys and \"hardware\" keys). I don't know the difference, but I know it took over 10 minutes of googling to figure out how to make the \"1\" key actually output \"1\".The software will also occasionally completely stop working. While playing FFXIV in a dungeon, I all of a sudden saw the mouse lights turn off. The software had locked up. My mouse had become completely unresponsive. So there I am, a lowly DPS standing in AOE cones trying to figure out why I can't turn around or pop any of my skills. It was because the corsair software had decided to bug out and freeze, losing all my mouse functionality.Another nit - the marketing. Razer knows who they're marketing to, and they stick to it. Corsair doesn't seem to know if they want to be \"Serious Gamers\" or \"LOL Gamer boyz&girlz!\" This box has the phrase \"Control Freak\" on the side. Now maybe I'm making a mountain out of mole hill, it's just the box, right? But every time I look at the box and see that, I like this product a bit less. I'm not a \"Control Freak\", I'm a guy that wants good products and hardware without childish terms being thrown at me by the manufacturer. So maybe my relationship with the scimitar started out on already shaky ground, just because of the box.Would I recommend this - probably not. If I could go back I would just save a bit more at first and buy the razer. I'm not really a Razer fanboy, but the naga is just a superior product.",
          "\u00a0Cabe aclarar que es mi primer mouse de este estilo y tal vez por eso se me dificulta un poco usarlo, pero como tal el dise\u00f1o es ergon\u00f3mico y se ajusta bien a mi mano. Sin embargo siento que los botones principales no se siente muy resistentes ni de buen material para ser un mouse de esta marca y con ese precio. Igualmente el bot\u00f3n derecho por alguna raz\u00f3n es demasiado sensible y por error puedes terminar presion\u00e1ndolo f\u00e1cilmente y hacerte cometer errores mientras trabajas o juegas.

Keypad buttons are rather small and I found myself fat fingerings them even after perfecting my rotation in ffxiv which was made so much easier with this type of mouse.2. Click rebound sucks.Like I click and there's to much of a delay before it lifts up almost like it sticking but not really.3. Build quality is good but comfort for me is a 2 I had cramps in my hands so quickly  and I thought maybe it's a muscles not used to it thing but I thin it's just how low to yh4 ground the mouse is that's the culprit.Overall not a bad mouse but not for me.Ordered a g600 to see if it fits me more. Won't touch razer unless last resort since they love to break.",
          "Good multi button mouse mainly for MMOs. I used it for WoW and FF14 and it works good. I wish each button was unique (like MB1 is left click so side button would be MB4 or 10 or whatever) so I could just set whatever button directly in game but the side buttons correspond to a key so you have to set it to that first, then in game set the key, and your good.Not enough of an issue to take a star off but something you should be aware of. I've mainly been using wireless mice for everything for a few years and got this one because it was cheaper. I do kind of regret not spending the extra and getting a wireless mouse like the Razer Naga but this is fine.With the shape of the mouse I did have to slightly adjust my hand placement and it was pretty uncomfortable for a while but I'm used to it now. I would recommend anyone to try and find a store that might have mice on display like Best Buy and check first. If I did that I would probably not have purchased this mouse.",
          "I love Corsair products.. I have the K95 RGB with the 18 key side panel for programming......the one they discontinued... been going strong for 5+ yearsI HAD an original Scimitar, (about a year ago) but accidentally flipped over my water jug onto it and it failed immediately... tried lots of things, nothing worked to bring it back.Since then Ive been thru 3 of the newer version Scimitars... the scroll wheel keeps going bad on them after about a few months... you scroll down and it goes DOWN a short bit.. then back up a LOT.. no idea what this is, and no idea how to fix it.I LOVE the programmable side buttons.... I just wish the scroll wheel didn't suck. Also.. the Macros software is pretty nice once you figure out it's personality",

So I bought this to help with the inevitable carpel tunnel. It has helped me tremendously and I use about every single button on it. The only gripe I have with it is the software for creating macros or setting up buttons for key binds. Could be a little simpler. We are in 2023 after all. Then again I\u2019m not extremely tech savvy when it comes to creating macros. I\u2019m more of a plug in a play type of person. Other than that it\u2019s a great mouse and I enjoy using it.Hope this helps!",
          "The mouse wheel was broken out of the box, though the only thing it can't do is be clicked to the left, for example, to return to the previous page in a browser, only to the right, though that's not a huge deal since I don't often use that feature anyway. The sensor seems to be janky and potentially defective, because it freaks out in-game fairly often, which makes the camera or whatever in whatever game, or the cursor anywhere else, shoot in a random direction. I've had one of these mice before, so I know that they're great mice when they're not defective, but this one either got past QC, or was used before, returned, and sold as new. I think I'm going to return this one.",

          "I purchased this mouse May of 2019. It's super programmable and amazing for shooters as all of the buttons on the side are programmable. Although it is truly the best mouse I've had - it only lasted me 4 years! I first noticed that the mouse would randomly disconnect. After that slowed down then the profiles would randomly change (sometimes even if I wasn't gaming). Before I decided to completely replace this the mouse wouldn't hold aim (right click).I'm for sure going to purchase again but I know the shelf life of it now.May 2019 - March 2023",
          "I use to buy Razer Naga constantly because something would die on them with frequent use. So I tried Corsair this time. Its been almost exactly one year since I bought it. Mouse wheel when scrolling down sometimes scrolls up and creating skips and annoyance. Google shows this to be a common problem. It sucks. All products are just made so crappy from everyone these days. I think the Razer software is better than the Corsair Icue software too.",
          "The mouse is absolutely amazing.  I love it and will likely continue to buy it each time this one goes down.  But I absolutely dread using the ICUE program to assign buttons on the mouse.  I have never encountered a program that is so unintuitive.  You should be able to click on a button and assign a key from your keyboard.  Instead, it's an absolute nightmare each time I have to try to figure out how to assign keys (I've only had to do it 3 times due to new computers or replacing the mouse).  It shouldn't take me an hour to assign 4 keys.  The program is in fact so horrible that it almost makes me want to not purchase this mouse next time, even though the mouse itself is by far the best gaming mouse I have tried so far.  I do recommend this mouse, but the software is the worst I have ever encountered.",
          "I had the original Scimitar when it was released nearly 8 years ago. My previous Scimitar did not have an easy life.  As it was attached to both my college laptop for use on campus and as my daily driver on my PC at home, it quickly racked up plenty use. I also competed on the collegiate esports teams for 4 years after playing as a trainee for a pro team. Needless to say, the 8 years of abuse the previous version took left me for high expectations for this one.After my old Scimitar died on me, I wanted to get a replacement, but this had taken its place. And while I no longer abuse my mice as much as I used to, this mouse still stands up to everything that I ask of it. I have been happy with corsair products and will recommend them until I have a bad experience with it.",
          "The mouse is exactly what I wanted. Except that after two years the left click isn't working properly which renders the mouse nearly useless. That's a short lifespan for a mouse in my opinion.",
          "In Oct 2021 I purchased this mouse as well as other Corsair branded products in building my new Rig I saved up for during COVID. I had originally used the UtechSmart Venus Gaming Mouse solely due to the fact that I enjoy the keypad on the side and I had large hands. I spent at the time roughly twice the amount of that in getting the Elite RGB version of the Scimitar due to trusting Corsair as a brand. The mouse feels nice, the buttons are responsive and looks great.The big docks in points are for two main issues that I have a hard time getting over. First and foremost the iCUE software is an absolute pain in the neck to navigate, and needs some form of a rework...either that or im a complete idiot. Secondly (and the main reason I am making this post) is that for the last six months the scroll wheel has slowly and steadily been becoming unresponsive and erratic, up to today where I am submitting an RMA due to it essentially having a mind of its own now. It has been beyond frustrating in both gaming and productivity, and I would say has contributed to about a half hour-45 minutes worth of scroll/highlight/deletes or unformatting in the time it has been noticed.I wanted and want to like this product. It has a premium price and should be well worth the money. I had the Utech mouse before this for almost 5 years and the worst issue I had to deal with was sensitivity issues that were resolved with a light cleaning...something that while this product has not had issues with, has traded for much worse.I pray that Corsair makes this right, and will be happy to amend the review given their response since I realize that these things happen, but at the same time you will read multiple reviews that showcase the same problem. If you're in the market for an MMO mouse at this point, given my current experience I would implore you to go with the UtechSmart Venus Gaming Mouse for almost half the price, 99% the functionality and none of the headache.",
          "Ive had this mouse for over 5 years now and the only reason I had to buy another was because the scroll wheel broke. Its unfortunate but expected after lots of use and travel. Before buying it I was choosing between this and the logitech G600. I tried the G600 but wasnt satisfied with its feel and material quality. The corsair one on the other hand was perfect. The programable buttons are useful and after a while you will get used to them and will wish all mice had the same features.",

          "So far, no issues with the mouse itself. The cable is long and durable. The texture is grippable. The buttons are adjustable.The only problem I have is the software. I believe it allows you to program the mouse so that you can take it to other devices and keep your settings (without needing iCue (the software recommended for programming the mouse) on the other devices). Occasionally, the software will just... stop... working... So I program MB3 and 4 to be pg-Up and pg-DOWN (makes web navigation much easier and I really don't need the DPI toggle or profile switch). It is infuriating whenever I go to use the buttons I reprogrammed, only to find that my profile has reset. Just randomly... It's as if on startup, the mouse just doesn't load my profile. So I have to manually go into iCue again and mess around a little, then it's back to normal.I'm not sure if the profile not loading is an issue with the [computer] chip in the mouse, if it is an issue with my [computer] OS, or if it is an issue with iCue. But I do know there is an issue.",
          "3.5 stars for reasons belowI have the following mice to give a fair assessment of what I think of this Corsair Scimitar:- Corsair Scimitar Pro- Razer Naga Epic Chroma- Logitech G600- Zowie ZA12- Logitech M510Pros- Lightweight- Customized lighting in 4 zones- Multi level DPI configuration levels w/on the fly switching- Button grid that can be slid forward and back for better hand position- Textured buttons with the 5 button with nib- Braided cableCons- Very much a palm mouse. If you claw, it may take a while to get used to- My 4 button gets stuck at times spewing 4's across the screen. I have to wiggle it to make it stop. Very bad.- Can only store 3 hardware profiles. This thing should be able to store a 100.- Clicking the middle scroll wheel as a button is way too rigid. Imagine setting this to spacebar for jumping in a FPS. It too rough and should have more \"give\" to it.- No lighting per button. Would be nice to distinguish rows for software purposes (i.e. editing, movement, building, fighting, etc.)- Cue software UI sucks for setting up this mouse. As a new user, you are better off deleting all the Actions and starting from scratch to learn the UI.- Top button next to mouse wheel is hard wired for profile switching. What if I wanted to use this for something else?- Surface calibration feature doesn't work well. I get terrible lag when trying to drag and draw in a circular pattern that it makes me wonder if this is even calibrating right. This, at 1600 DPI setting on a Corsair XXL mat and fast Ryzen 1700X.Improvements needed:- Get rid of the metal plate. Its unnecessary baggage that adds to the weight of the mouse and cost. The lighter the better for less hand fatigue.- Storing only 3 profiles is lame. Many of us play way more games and use many applications. Let us store at least 100 profiles by designing the mouse to use microSD to store the profiles on. When you click the profile button, it brings up a dialog box that lets us select which profile to use. You owe me Corsair for this idea.- Cue software needs to not show panels that don't correlate to the present view. For example, why should the left panel of buttons that have nothing to do with the grid buttons be shown? Also don't show the G1-G10 panel when it has nothing to do with the present view. Stupid things like this clutter up the UI configuration and cause confusion. The lower panel also needs to be in sync with the present focus of the button.- Way too long of a cable.I attach this to the back of my Corsair Strafe keyboard port and you won't believe how ugly this looks on the desk. Supply a short braided 3' cable and a 10' cable. I've also have too many USB connect/disconnect problems in this configuration.- Ability to slide the grid back another 1/4\". People with small hands (even kids) have to go into claw mode instead of palm mode to get at these buttons. For example, I rest my palm on the mouse and my thumb is comfortably on the 5 key. The button grid is all the way slid back. However, when I need to reach for the 123 keys, I have to physically lift my hand off the mouse and reach for the 123. If I don't, I risk clicking on two keys (i.e. 1/4, 2/5, 3/6). This forces me to push my hand forward wasting valuable time, especially in FPS games.One thing to consider that I noticed on all my MMO mouses is that if you have a need to lift the mouse off the mat, these devices are not ideal.  First, they are heavier than your typical gaming mouse like the Zowie EC. Over long play sessions, you develop hand fatigue. Second, you can accidentally click one of the buttons on the grid at an inopportune time, espeically while you are playing a fast FPS game. Lastly, finding a means to even grip onto something and lift is a problem - there's nothing to grab onto and feels way unstable. The design on this mouse is awkward. Along the right hand side there is a textured rubber grip region. But, my ring finger and pinky can't grip this and lift without feeling like I'm losing grip.These types of mice are best suited for palm players with larger hands. More for your Warcraft, Dota, type of games rather than FPS.  If you are going to use this for FPS and play with low DPI and need to lift, good luck! More times than not I have felt that I lost the sense of grip and moved from palming, to clawing.",
          "It\u2019s a great, Affordable, MMO mouse. If you looking for that it does the trick.",
          "I really want to like this mouse but I can't find any acceptable way to me to hold it and game. Either I'm a moron or this mouse was not designed to be held the same way as a standard mouse. I did have some success using my finger tips in just the right place(and there's only one) but I can't retrain my brain to game that way. Nope, for me it's an enormous fail and I am in the process of returning it. Shame though, I really like the idea. Maybe I will try the Razors version and see if it's any better someday, but for now it's the Corsair wireless gaming mouse for me.",
          "After trying the Razer naga X, Logitech G600, and this Corsair RGB Elite, this is the most comfortable, user-friendly, and responsive. It's much lighter than the unusable G600 (which feels like you're holding a turtle), and it's easier to know which button you're touching due to its texture variants. If you're looking for the best from these 3, go for the Corsair Scimitar.The only feedback would be that I wish it were narrower. I don't understand why they need to make 12-button mice so wide.",
          "Having small hands and being a gamer... not a great combo. Finding keyboards and mice that are easy for me to use while being in my price range is a difficult feat. On top of that, a few years ago I fell on my right side and so now that wrist and hand both get sore if I play too long or with too heavy of a mouse.The best mouse I ever had for my situation was the Razer Naga Molten. Razer no long makes this mouse and the people selling it want a ridiculous amount, so after mine got the dreaded double-click issue that all Razer mice get, I had to find something else. I've tried 5 different mice in the past few years, all of them recommended by articles for people with \"small hands\". Most of the people who write these probably don't have small hands and just talked about generally ergonomic mice without understanding what it actually means to be small hand friendly.So, after the recommended mice from these articles failed me in various ways, I started my own search for generally lightweight mice, figuring the lightest of mice would also be small, and I ended up here. Regular price was a little out of my reach, then Amazon day came along... Had to give this one a try.It's ridiculously lightweight, which was my main draw to it. The sliding numbers are a huge bonus I could live without in reality, but I do love, because it allows my small hands to reach the buttons with very little effort. Those numbers being textured helps a lot too, definitely didn't think I'd need or want that. It's just a tiny bit bigger than I like, but not uncomfortably so - I feel like I can get used to it, especially considering it is so light.If you're looking for a lightweight mouse in general, small or big hands, then this has got to be one you try out.",
          "That being said, I've only ever used the M65 and this one, this being my second scimitar.This time, Amazon packaging was open on arrival & box looked like it had been thrown around.Other than that, no issues; I love this mouse.",

          "First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation.",
          "I've been testing out a few MMO mouses lately- Logitech G600, Steelseries Rival 500, and this Corsair Scimitar Pro. Of the 3, this is the best and most comfortable mouse in my opinion. The buttons are crisp, the slide-able grid panel allows for hand size adjustments, and its a great looking mouse. With that said, I will focus on what I found WRONG with the mouse, because a few improvements could make this mouse perfect.The problems arise in some unexpected areas. This mouse has the unusual quality of being too small AND too heavy at the same time. I found my fingertip going up off the top of the mouse, despite having the side-panel all the way back, due to this mouses design (more on that later). The extra weight is because there is a metal weight bar inexplicably centered around the laser sensor of this plastic mouse.The awkwardness of this is compounded by 'forced ergonomics' found on the right side of the mouse. They want your hand to be in a very specific place on this mouse, with your ring finger in a very specific position. There is a 'bubble' of curvature  right around the base of the right click, forcing your middle finger into a certain posture too.All of this compounds the weight issue, since you are made to lift the mouse with your ring finger postured awkwardly. This design cause hand fatigue or cramps for some who arent used to this type of grab. I would've honestly rather the right side of the mouse just sloped down much deeper and tapered off. To be fair though.. awkward design like this is present in most MMO mouse, if Corsair lightened the weight it would be a non issue.With that said, the TRULY unforgivable sin lies with the Corsair RGB software. You will be presented with a very archaic interface for programming buttons. Interfaces for adjusting Pointer Speed have no tick marks or levels.. so be prepared to remember EXACTLY where you had it before you make adjustments. I would caution people to avoid \"surface calibration too\"- There is no universal reset button on this interface, you might be stuck with a very jarring surface speed, with no known recourse.While this may sound as if I dislike the mouse, that isnt true. This is the winner out of all the MMO mice I've tested. The positives of it are straightforward and core, the negatives of it are more nuanced and have clear solutions- be it slight redesign or less laziness in software. The other mice I mentioned both had worse button schemes and ergo designs (such as the ring finger button on g600)I would recommend this MMO mouse above all others in the current market.",
          "This is after over 6 months of usage.Honestly, I've tried many different brands version of the MOBA mouse and this one is the best that I have tried so far!! I love how the 12 side buttons can be adjusted to your liking and the software gives you many options to change the LED lights. Left and right clicks aren't loud, side buttons don't make a loud clicking noise but you know when you pressed it and the tracking feels very good. I've been playing PC for about 7 years and a lot of other brands tracking will either feel heavy or have a slight pause when moving your mouse around.If you're looking for a really good MOBA mouse that is worth the money, it will be this one.",
          "I used the original version of this for a few years but had a weird USB issue that eventually annoyed me enough to go back to a Naga - this was a mistake. The Scimitar is definitely better than the Naga. That said, when I purchased this, less than a week later the 4 button on the side started sticking. I immediately requested a replacement which I now have...will update this review if it starts sticking with the new one as well. Aside from that, it's awesome!",
          "Beautiful mouse! Very comfortable for mmo gaming. Best on the market for these purposes.",
          "I bought this specifically for Final Fantasy XIV, it works amazingly and pairs really well with my Corsair K70 Rapid Fire. Though, I think they could have done better with the materials' quality, especially for the scroll wheel. The scroll wheel button started failing after about a year and a bit more with regular use, sometimes it double clicks when I only pressed it once. The piece of plastic it is attached with also seems pretty weak so I have been very careful. I try to keep everything as clean as possible but dust can get behind the numbers pad quite easily and it is not really removable. Other than that I feel like it is light weight but not too light, I also own the Logitech G502 and I feel like the Scimitar Pro is lighter and larger. The Corsair iCue software is also really good, it makes pairing many profiles for both my mouse and keyboard very easily and you can make a lot of different cool macros to help you in game and for productivity as well, you can map different color profiles and many other things. I highly recommend it though I wish the material quality was a bit better.Update: Downgraded to 4 stars (more like 3.5) yet no less because my experience with Corsair Customer Support was incredible and they replaced my old Scimitar once. However, I am replacing this mouse with one from Razer because I am now experiencing new issues after a few months of use. The new Scimitar now has an issue where keys become unresponsive on and off very randomly after 1 hour of use which is no good in a fast paced game and the scroll wheel is glitchy as it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't or goes in the wrong direction. After some reading around on forums I found that the new version Scimitar Elite also has the same issue and the scroll wheel is also weak. This is what made me switch over to Razer for now. Corsair needs to really improve the quality of the mouse, I take really good care of my stuff which is why I don't think it is reasonable for it to start failing so quickly. The other Corsair products I own are really well made and have lasted for much longer but I will avoid their mice lineup for a while.",
          "Used a Razer Death Adder mouse for years, that thing was a work horse. I tried the Razer Naga but absolutely could not get used to the bank of buttons and ended up giving it away. Most recently was using a Steel Series Rival 300, which was fine, but I'm a claw gripper and my fingertips ended up way too far back on the mouse and it felt inefficient and sometimes my hand got achy. (I've since read reviews that it's better suited for palm grippers; should have read review before buying it, haha.) ANYWAY, regarding the Corsair Scimitar Pro - I'm determined to transition to more keybinding and macros in game and decided to try the MMO type mouse again, and I read that this one is good for claw grips because it has a higher back-end hump (under the palm) and is s bit shorter over all for a claw grip. I have long hands for a woman and prefer a larger mouse generally, and this one is proving so far to feel great under the hand - the slightly more bulbous back end helps anchor it a bit in the hand.  I've adjusted the sliding button bank to suit my thumb position, and it's a good fit. My only hesitation thus far is that your thumb by default rests on the buttons and I'm nervous about pressing one or more accidently while generally using the mouse, though I admit that this hasn't actually happened, so that might be just me not being used to them being there yet. Also the top of the mouse is a bit slippery but I expect that to go away as the normal skin oils do their thing (at least I hope.)  Unlike my Steel Series which slid around on my big steel desk like a cow on ice skates (had to buy a pad to even use it) - this mouse adjusted itself and works equally welI on the smooth steel or the rubberized fabric mouse pad.  I've also not had issues with lift, I adjusted the lift in the software and it's been fine. I've seen one or two comments on the build quality, but that has not been my experience with this product or Corsair in general. I'm not a bargain buyer, price is rarely the driver in my choices (drives hubs nuts!), and I've returned to Corsair as a brand several times now for PC components, my keyboard and now this mouse. I've never had any issues with quality or performance from their stuff.  Lastly, I like the fun lighting options because I'm a nerd, and the understated  design & logo because I'm a middle-age woman with a normal job who would feel stupid with giant glowing skulls and equipment that looks like transformer toys.",
          "+ It has 12 keys.+ Adjustable 12 key pad position.+ Tough braided wire.- No left/right tilt buttons on wheel.- Wheel click incredibly stiff.- Every component is too large.- THE SOFTWARE IS COMPLETE JUNK.Okay, so I used a Naga 2014 since...well, 2014.  It started dying in a way I couldn't repair.  I had previously owned and loved a Corsair keyboard (which I had replaced a Black Widow Razer keyboard with) and thought I might try out the Scimitar.  The first time my Naga 2014 had a problem the Naga Trinity was still over a hundred bucks.  I didn't even check this time, just went with the Scimitar.The second I had it out of the package I knew it was too big in every way.  The side keys, the mouse wheel, the shape and height overall...  Too big for me.  My hand ached from simply trying to feel it out.  But I bought it when I -thought- I needed it and my Naga 2014 lasted me another couple months so...way outside the return window.  I forced myself to give it a go.So the first upset, after the size, was realizing that not only did I lose two binds (tilt left and right) but that I would not be able to use the ridiculously stiff middle mouse button.Obviously, the next step is to play with the software.  I download iCue as suggested with this product and at first, it seems great!  There's tons of options and I wade through the seemingly endless options setting everything up super nice.Let's check all the existing binds...oh, 1-12 isn't bound as 1-12...kind of a pain in the butt...okay let's use the 'profile switch' (typically DPI increase on most mice) as Ctrl-W for browsing...also to hotkey in WoW for healing...  And then I realized I'd lost two of my three mouse healing binds.  I use a gaming mouse to game with for specific reasons and being able to have all those mouse binds is integral to my gameplay...Whatever, let's see how this goes...spend a few days doing nothing important on games and just generally browsing on the PC.So I go through all the trouble of cleaning out the default stuff, setting up two profiles and the colors and  the macros/keybinds/windows tasks and give 'em a go.  Great!  Working great.  ...for...about...10 minutes.Now, at this point I've also picked up a Strafe keyboard.  Figure they might as well match.  And that thing is atrocious.  I liked it okay until I put it on my lap and realized the 2 freaking inch high keys weren't gonna work out for my standard play position.  But I digress, point is I set it up in the software as well with colors and between the two profiles.So yeah, ten minutes into gaming I move my mouse to the other screen to close a tab with Ctrl+W and it doesn't work.  Because (I later realized) every time I mouse off of WoW, the profile tries to change.  And in that time when it's trying to change, there's no keybind to the profile switch button which makes it a profile switch button.  So everything was borking out any time I alt tabbed through windows or moved my mouse to the wrong place.  So I take it down to one profile after a night of being confused and thinking there was just some weird lag going on.  The one profile works for a few hours and then it starts happening again so I check the app.  The iCue app has repopulated the profile list with the 5 default profiles (2 for the mouse and 3 for the keyboard iirc) and the profile switch button is doing both profile switching and CtrlW.  ...deep breaths.I spent the next week trying to make it work.  Any time I hibernated my PC or even randomly during the day, the profiles would repopulate.  At one point iCue even told me there was an error specifically because the default profiles weren't up there.  Uh, this is my system, I don't want those?  I deleted them for a reason?  If you have to have them, why is there a delete button?  Ctrl+W was my extra button hotkey and a heal macro.  So I'd be questing or healing and all of a sudden it wouldn't work.  Worse than that is that as I previously mentioned, 1-12 AREN'T BOUND by default.  So when you hit profile switch...bam, the mouse is useless.So basically at this point I've got an app that doesn't work and a mouse I hate and...naw.  I just said screw it.  I bought a Razer Trinity and Ornata V2.  The Trinity and the software are miles, lightyeeeaarrss, better than the Corsair products.",
          "I absolutely love this mouse! I have very tiny hands and tried all sorts of MMO mice, but this is the only one with an ergonomic design that my hand could fit on. Not only that, the side buttons help so much in MMOs like FFXIV and WOW, and on this one you can slide the side button panel up or down to adjust as you want for your thumb!If this mouse goes, I'm getting another one!",
          "Nice -option!- for gaming",
          "Corsair released the Scimitar RGB mouse some time ago without much fanfare, competing directly with the Naga - Corsair came out swinging big however with a strong product that featured a patented slider key system to move the 12 button layout how you wanted which was a nice idea for such a large amount of buttons. They offered a 3988 sensor powered mouse that offered acceptable performance for multi-use purposes, a comfortable safe shape, with a readily accessible panel of buttons for macros or keybinds. The problem with the old mouse, that I had, however was three fold. The first major issue with the old Scimitar was the sensor performance. Regardless of what you set the lift-off distance too - it was still very high, and upon making lifting movements would cause wild changes in cursor position even at low CPI settings. This was my biggest, and loudest complaint with the 3988 powered mouse. The other two problems were less severe, but still problematic... and it was the buttons.The buttons had a specific ... mushy... feeling to them despite being mechanical switches, and the other major issue with the buttons was that despite where you might slide the side button panel, the keys sat far too low in the chassis, causing my thumb to rub up against the mouse mat whenever I would attempt to use 1,4,7, or 10 buttons on the mouse. Not a huge issue, but a minor annoyance. The third problem was easily fixable - and it was the CUE software. A beautifully designed piece of software, that was just unfortunately not intuitive to use, and buggy as all get out...I am happy to say TWO of those major issues have not only been resolved entirely, but improved greatly.The new Corsair Scimitar Pro packs Corsair's own iteration of the popular PMW-3360 sensor, which they have called the PMW-3367. Lift off distance issues have been entirely resolved, as well as much better performance on a variety of surfaces. I tested the Corsair Scimitar Pro on a QCK+ Heavy, Zowie GSR, PureTrak Talent, MMX300, and a GLORIOUS XXXL, and it performed great on all the surfaces - all which have very different material.The other major issue is CUE, I am happy to say it has definitely improved in both usability, and function - while they still have kinks to work out - they are making headway into creating a great software suite. Not much else to say on that front. Some features I would add include the ability to reset surface calibration, as at present - you are not able to.The clicks, the left and right, feel springy and have good tension. Not quite Logitech G303 / G900 / G Pro clicks - but definitely up there in quality. Side panel buttons are better - not quite where I'd like them to be in terms of feedback, but definitely getting better. I can't quite tell but I feel like they've been slightly more spaced apart to be more easily \"findable\" on the fly. These could still benefit from being raised up slightly, as they still sit a little low for my comfort, but again - this is a minor personal opinion.The shell material itself has changed as well... less rubbery, and more plastic, but I think this was done to address durability concerns, as the rubbery coating on my old Scimitar despite only being purchased in November has already begun to wear - I forsee the Pro's coating to be much better in terms of wear and tear.The weight is a little on the high side for FPS / MOBA players, but it is certainly not excessive. with a bit of cable coming in at 118 grams for me. I prefer my mice under 100 grams, however in this case - this mouse is specifically for MMO use for me - I have other mice for FPS / General Use - so if you're an mmo player looking for a top-quality sensor mouse that can be used in FPS or other games that won't put you at any sort of disadvantage, I can highly recommend this mouse.Some odd design choices for me include the strip of brushed aluminium at the bottom of the mouse that houses the sensor - while it looks nice and gives a premium feel - the aluminium provides a jumping off point for fibers to get caught on cloth pads. I have not seen this happen with the Pro iteration yet - but it most certainly did on the old Scimitar.To be clear, there are things Corsair could still do to bring this mouse up to another level - shaving some weight and raising the buttons up a bit would improve ergonomics greatly, without much change to the design - but overall we are looking at an iterative change that brings a lot to the table. It is most certainly an evolution of the design, and brings great performance to the table at a good price.All in all - I'd say if you're in the market for an MMO mouse that can be more than that - grab a Corsair Scimitar Pro. You won't be disappointed in your purchase.",
          "Product arriving disgustingly filthy aside, this mouse doesn't seem up to par with my other Corsair mice in terms of quality.I got it from Amazon warehouse for 67% off and after a little TLC from a Clorox wipe, it looked in good condition. I'm trying not to imagine how greasy the person's hands must have been to leave stains like that, but whatever.The buttons on the side are too close together and too easily pressed to reliably use for the size of my thumb and hands. I found it quite difficult to only press one button if it wasn't along the edge. The mouse itself feels cheap and flimsy too. Regardless, I ended up giving it to my kids to use and they think it's cool, so a win overall."

          "I have had the privilege of using an excellent mouse these past few years, the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse. It's not responding the way it used to, and it's not holding much of a charge anymore so I knew that it was time to find a suitable replacement. I really like Corsair's gaming gear, so I thought that I'd give the Dark Core a go, as it seemed the closes to the MX Master 3. I was a bit disappointed to be honest.PROSThe RGB effects are minimal, but add a nice flair to the mouse, and really adds a lot to the gamer type of aesthetic.It's incredibly easy to connect, either with the provided dongle, or via Bluetooth. I've always had to play around a bit with every Logitech I've owned, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and quickly this connected.It has buttons for everything, which especially comes in handy with FPS games.CONSAs usual, Corsair's software is a nightmare to try and figure out, so there's always that. There really needs to be a full-blown tutorial for their iCUE software alone.it's got a texture that I'm assuming is supposed to make it more sweat-resistant, but I don't believe it's altogether too effective.The additional ergonomic side piece that the mouse comes with is possibly MORE uncomfortable than the part that's already on the mouse. I would not recommend switching it out.The plastic this is made with feels a bit TOO lightweight and flimsy.Overall, I don't believe this to be nearly as nice of a mouse as my old Logitech MX Masater 3, but it's not all bad. It looks great, has more button options for your games, and is definitely more responsive. There's improvements I would like to see. I'd like a bit firmer plastic, maybe a rubberized texture for gripping, and more RGB options. This is definitely a decent mouse, but for the price tag, I would consider something else.",
          "I don't really have anything terribly negative to say about the mouse other than it was way too big for my hands.  I didn't really game with it that much because the shape of this thing did not agree with me.  I am 6 ft tall and would say I have pretty average size hands and feet and this mouse was just not the way.  I used it for about an hour and packed it back up and took it to my local UPS store.  I have tried several different mice over the years looking for anything that can knock off the King (in my opinion) my Razer Basilisk.  I just love my Basilisk for some reason and every time I cheat on it with another mouse I come right back to it lol.  So if you're a 6\"4' or bigger giant this mouse would be for you.  For all you gamers with average size hands you probably won't find this mouse comfortable to use.  This may be a fantastic mouse but I couldn't use it to find out 3 out of 5 stars based on that.",
          "As someone that spends the majority of the day on my computer(12+hours), I tend to purchase more robust or sturdy components.Given the above, I realize that my usage might be extra ordinary, however, it is certainly not as much, nor as intense, as a \"Pro FPS/MOBA player\" for whom this product is marketed toward.I want a mouse that can last 5+yrs and sadly, I have yet to find one that goes more than 4.When I spend this much on a mouse, I would expect it to at least outlast a mid-tier mouse, sadly, this mouse did not last any longer.I first noticed the double clicks after a year.As of today(2.5years of ownership), I get at least one double click every 10~50 clicks.The switch sometimes bounces more than once per button press resulting in a triple or quadruple click.What I've learned over the last 2+ years is that it doesn't matter which \"high quality\"/gaming mouse you go with, wireless or not, cause they all tend to use the same mirco-switches.I really wish these manufacturers would figure out the issue with those micro-switches.tbh, for my next mouse, I plan to get one that I can hot-swap or easily(read NO SOLDERING) change the switches given how quickly they go bad.Unfortunately Corsair doesn't make any.I generally like the other Corsair products I have, mousepad, headsets(3), PSU(3).",
          "I wanted to like this mouse... I really did.  But it's just not great.Pros:-Has a nice feel - pretty ergonomic-I liked the \"wings\" to rest my fingers on, and really liked that the right one was interchangeable depending on preference.-Battery life seems pretty good, and the Qi charging worked well-Pretty customizable with the softwareCons:-The buttons next to the left click - I was hoping that these were mappable to use in game, but they are locked to DPI up/down-The wireless dongle that it comes with was very finicky... I had to have this as close as possible to the mouse, or it didn't connect proplerly.-Bluetooth had better range, but it had noticeable lag with the inputs-It may be due to the surface that I'm using, but the sensitivity of the laser seems suspect when trying to aim - it seemed to \"jump\" a lot, rather than make smooth movementOverall, I wouldn't recommend this mouse for gaming.  Maybe I had a one-off experience, but it just doesn't compare to my wired mouse.  Was I expecting too much for a wireless mouse?  Perhaps.  But it's too much money for a poorly performing product.",
          "First things first. I needed a large mouse for large hands and I finally stumbled upon this gem of a mouse that feels like it was made for me. (I was using a G502 previously and found it to be to small). So I decided to buy it and found out that it sold out  literally everywhere at my place. So I had it shipped to my country through Amazon Global standard shipping(through Aramex) . Arrived a week early and was well packaged but the box had to opened for a customs check. No items were missing , so good.The mouse is really well built and is a bit on the heavier side but I like my mice heavy. The ergonomics are really perfect for large hands (hand size: 19.5x10cm) and the included pinky rest is a lifesaver for both gaming and work. The mouse feet are really smooth, in fact too smooth that I had to lower my sensitivity lol. All buttons can be customized with Corsair iCUE quick and easy and if you need macros that can be done within the software as well. Some features can be saved to the mouse on-board memory profiles (up to 3) so you do not need the software all the time. RGB is bright and beautiful. The outer body has a textured plastic that is miles better than rubber.Wireless : Corsair slipstream is truly an achievement and I found no difference in performance when using the mouse in both wired and wireless mode. iCUE is only required for the pairing the mouse and the dongle. After that you can turn the software off if needed. I've had some lag (that goes away after 5-10 secs) when trying to use the mouse after the computer starts up or awakens from sleep mode however this is a standard phenomena that occurs with all wireless mice.  The mouse is a breeze to use without wires. (the included wire is too stiff and can push the mouse on a flat surface if it gets coiled)Battery and charging: Battery life is average. Mouse lasts for about 9-10hrs with all lights turned on and takes about 2-3 hrs to fully charge. Wireless charging is OK , it takes a bit of time but its really well implemented and mouse lights up white to let you know it it is charging wirelessly with any Qi certified charger. Note: There is no percentage indicator letting you know how much battery is left even in software unfortunately.Miscellaneous issues : I have heard of issues of accidental right click and mushy switches in some reviews. At least in my unit , I haven't had such experiences....yet. (will update if any occurs).Cons: The Corsair iCUE software is a pain to use and it literally crashes my PC when trying to game. Button mapping although easy to do gets ages to save in the software and I finally decided just to save it to the onboard profile instead. Also one major problem I found - If you have a low end PC and you also have other corsair peripherals such a s a Corsair keyboard , the software forces you to save multiple (unnecessary) profiles to both software and onboard memory of BOTH keyboard and mouse to function properly. If it is not done it causes a lot of software glitches and unresponsiveness of keys on the keyboard and DPI buttons on the mouse. Also if you uninstall iCUE with keyboard and mouse connected , It will take away the RGB of both devices for some reason. There is also a bug that says 'your profiles are not saved , go to device settings to save' even if I saved the profile to mouse multiple times. The profiles will work but it is an annoyance to see that pop up again.  I strongly recommend you disable the software after you have done all your mapping, wireless and macros if you are on a low end device.Verdict:  Overall the best ergonomic mouse that I have laid my hands on. They don't make mice like these anymore after most \"pro's\" switched to ultralightweight mice. Good modular support and ease of use. Only held back by the horrible iCUE software. (P.S -pretty much all mouse software have some issues...although my review thrashes iCUE , I just want you to know that no software is perfect even if it is from Logitech or Razer , it is just a matter of getting used to it until they fix it ).I recommend this mouse.",
          "I bought this after my previous mouse, also a Corsair, began to malfunction, felt that it might be interesting to try a wireless mouse for once, as it's something I've never bothered to purchase or even consider.This mouse doesn't really disappoint when it comes to quality, it feels very nice in the hand and the response time is actually akin to that of a wired mass in my opinion, no noticeable hiccups or disconnects, it clicks reliably and the mouse wheel measures basically one to one in it's inputs.My main qualm with the device ITSELF is the lack of a dedicated key on the mouse for switching from your standard sensitivity to a lower sensitivity, referred to by Corsair as a \"sniper button\", a term that I think fits the function well.It could probably also be said that the actual device having to run through the Corsair software is an issue, but that really is more of a software issue than a hardware issue and once you get used to the Corsair software it isn't absolutely the worst, it just isn't the best either.",
          "Good- Feels great in the hand, performs well, really does have pretty low latency, iCUE software makes updating and customizing lighting a breeze.Okay- The wireless charging feature does work, but does require a QI wireless charger, and getting the two to pair and start charging is finnicky. Mouse has to be in exactly the right spot.Annoying - The scroll wheel softly squeaks.Overall, I'm happy. But the squeaky wheel in particular feels like something that could have been prevented.",
          "I had a Mionix mouse for years that I absolutely loved but the middle mouse switch was dying on me.I've got big hands and likewise need a mouse that fits my needs! I tried a few other brands but they were all quite small for me. After a bit of research, I found this had dimensions similar to my old mouse so I gave it a go, as I really REALLY wanted a good wireless gaming mouse.BOY OH BOY does this fit the bill!!!Wired and wireless feel no different, in terms of speed and latency. It also seems to work from quite far!I've only had it for a day, but I'm in love so far!!!There is a detachable 'wing' for your pinky if you find yours drags on your mouse, or you can leave the default \"flat\" on, which is what I did.I do not know the battery life as of yet, though I plan on testing it out now that it has a full charge.It has an awesome dongle/wired/bluetooth option, the last of which I am really excited for!If you have big hands and want a great wireless gaming mouse that is fairly comfortable (the butt-end is a LITTLE higher than I would have liked but its nit-picking at this point), absolutely give this a try! You wont regret it!",
          "UPDATE: I sent in the mouse under warranty and received a \"refurbished\" mouse that was MORE DAMAGED THAN THE ONE I SENT IN FOR REPAIR. How does this happen?I had this mouse purchased for me in Oct 2021 as a birthday gift. About three months later, the bottom skate on the mouse began peeling away in the right corner. I reached out to Corsair support requesting a replacement mouse skate, and even offered to pay for it, as I had no proof of purchase seeing as it was a gift. They told me I was not eligible for any sort of support for the device, including the opportunity to buy replacement parts at cost+shipping, because it was a gift.I should have learned my lesson, but decided to purchase one for myself as I really like the ergonomics of this mouse. My replacement is now only 6 months old and has skate damage in the *exact* same spot as the first mouse. This is an extremely flawed skate design and I am beyond disappointed at the lack of durability or support I have gotten for this issue. I will NOT be buying another Corsair mouse despite 90% of my PC peripherals are in the Corsair ecosystem.",
          "I ended up returning this mouse as I was having issues with it.First, the \"SLIPSTREAM WIRELESS\" dongle initially connected to mouse automatically. However upon restarting or booting the PC, the mouse would connect to the dongle as evidenced by the status light on the mouse, but the cursor on screen would not move until the dongle was physically removed and re-plugged in. Corsair support recommended changing some settings in Windows device manager to allow the PC to be woken from sleep by USB devices, which didn't work.Second, after changing the lighting settings for the mouse in Corsair's iCue software, both the left and right mouse buttons would randomly begin to act as if one mouse click was being held down, or the mouse would not register a click at all. Corsair support recommended resetting the mouse to factory settings to fix this, which consists of turning it off, holding both the side buttons down and turning the mouse on. This initially worked, but making any changes to the settings in iCue would just cause this problem again.Third, I was never able to setup the RGB lighting so that it retained it's settings when it was unplugged from the USB cable, both with the wireless dongle and with Bluetooth. I didn't take the time to figure this issue out with the other two problems I had, but I'm sure it is possible to do this, it's just that Corsair's iCue software isn't exactly intuitive to use. The addition of the mouse also really slowed down the iCue software so much so I thought the program quit responding.The first thing that Corsair support suggested was to update the firmware on both the mouse and the dongle, which I did, but ultimately didn't work.The last complaint I have with this mouse is the rubberized coating on the palm area of the mouse. It's the first mouse I've used that actually made my hand sweat while I was using it, even in the couple of hours I was troubleshooting the other issues before I decided to just return it. I now understand why there are other's here saying the coating on their mouse wore off, it's very rubbery and you can tell it's a very thin coating over the plastic of the mouse, I can see how the oils and sweat from your hand could rub the coating off if you're the type to rest your whole palm on the mouse.It's a real shame I had these issues because otherwise I really liked the mouse. It's got a very cool looking design with the RGB and the rests on the sides for both your thumb and pinky. It's pretty well sized as well, I have medium-large hands and it was very comfortable to use (minus the rubber coating).I don't know if I just got a bad mouse, or if there's something about my setup (I have a bunch of other Corsair components in my PC that use iCue) that's causing these problems, but I have other wireless devices that don't have these issues at all. There are a few unresolved threads on Corsair's own support forum with people having the same technical issues as I have, some complaining about having issues only after updating their firmware, so it seems Corsair's firmware isn't up to par.",
          "I bought this mouse because I have slightly larger than normal hands and most mice are just too small for me. I don't claw grip mice, I use the side of my thumb and the side of the ring finger or pinky to hold the mouse, depending on the design. I have an old Razer Naga, my first gaming mouse that I loved, but I was always dragging my pinky finger on the mousepad while gripping using the ring finger shelf. I bought a reddragon M602 because it seemed to have a similar design to the naga but bigger. The Naga had a slightly higher feeling hump, but the M602 is longer and the fingers don't go off the end of the right and left buttons. The Corsair Dark Core Pro SE doesn't have a ring finger rest, but it has a right side plate that adds a shelf that I can curl and put both the ring finger and the pinky finger on the rest, no dragging fingers! I would prefer a separate ring finger rest along with the bottom shelf on the right side of the mouse, but it is still an improvement on the other mice I have used. The fact I can charge this wirelessly using the same charger for my cell phone is a bonus. I gave 4 stars for ergonomics because I'd like to see this mouse raised a few MM, stretched lengthwise a few MM and a slightly less wide right button and a ring finger shelf added. Even without the ring finger shelf, if this mouse was larger by a few MM in length and height, it would be nearly perfect. I already use Void Pro headsets as they have been amazingly comfortable, and the dark core was picked up by the iCue software right away and has been easy to configure using the iCue software.",
          "Its a great mouse all around, it has a very long battery life, can last me 2 to 3 days worth of gaming fully charged. But it is big and bulky unless you have big hands, also carries a bit of weight to it but all around is a good mouse.",
          "Some people have had trouble charging the mouse on a Qi pad. The charging coil is at the rear of the mouse, so that is the part that has to be centered on the charging pad. Some people center the mouse on the charging pad and the mouse will not charge that way, giving the impression of a shorter battery life, etc.My mouse doesn't squeak.It is comfortable enough and the wifi connection is extremely responsive. As a gaming mouse it is very high quality.The iCUE software is terrible for assigning key functions to the mouse -- and the videos and other aids posted by Corsair contain a lot of errors, contradictions, and outright misinformation.",
          "I may be a little biased but almost every gaming peripheral I own is built by Corsair. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s hype or if they truly are at the top of their weight class, but I have yet to be let down by a single product of theirs. The mouse feels incredible (especially if ergonomics are critical to you), the button presses are really sensitive (perfect for gamers who need quick response times), and the RGB...... WOW..... The number of lighting modes and effects you can set up is actually bonkers. I can't even begin to describe how easy the iCUE software makes it when designing the \"perfect\" theme. This is a must if you're already in the Corsair ecosystem. The amount of DPI settings really sell this thing. You can set up 3 options to toggle between on the fly with easy-to-reach buttons on the mouse, but for fine tuned settings, you can program the \"perfect\" DPI using iCUE.",
          "Got this to replace my darkcore rgb I bought about 4 years ago and is now unable to charge the battery. The pro has a nice rgb upgrade with multiple argb per zone allowing for nice patterns effects. Matterial feel is what you would expect from corsair, tough high quality plastics and textured grips. Clicky buttons let you know you pushed a button. They removed the snipper button but I never used it and now the thumb buttons are easier to find. Its a bit heavy for a gaming mouse but I am used to the weight. I have had it for a few weeks now and still have not needed to charge it but admit I haven't used it for long gaming sessions yet.Rgb integration into the ique software is great and syncs with my other corsair components well.",
          "The pros - this mouse has a pretty good battery life, it can be plugged in or wireless and the wireless charging is a nice feature. Corsairs software is top notch and you can adjust the settings on the fly and even set up profiles for what apps you have running. Indicator lights work well and it has enough buttons to do normal FPS gaming and surfing options.The con, and this is unfortunately a fairly large one, I get a hair of lag when its wireless, meaning wireless mode is not ideal for FPS gaming, or really any gaming. So I frequently operate it wirelessly when I'm just surfing the net and stuff but if I'm going to play I plug it in.  This might be my setup creating an issue, my tower does sit 4 feet from the mouse, the drawers for the desk are between the mouse and its receiver so these are all things that could be the cause and that I'll try and tweak down the road but it is something I am experiencing so figured fair warning to anyone else who may have a similar set up.",
          "The se version works with qi wireless so after a gaming session I just set it on my wireless mellinium falcon and let it charge. If you have the virtuoso xt headset, it can be paired with the slipstream wireless dongle. When doing so it pairs with icue and allows you to mute your mic and turn off all corsair rgb with the button located above the scroll wheel. The mouse feels great in hand and the rgb works flawlessly.",
          "Can't get the Bluetooth mode to work and the rubbery palm area coating has begun to flake off after use far below \"gamer\" usage. But other than that it works ok.",
          "I buy gaming mice primarily because of their size, ergonomics and customization. This mouse is everyone's comfortable in my hand and works very well.  There are two buttons on the upper left side which slow you to increase and decrease the dpi. Button placement is perfect for my hand. It also works while charging.",
          "My old mouse was literally worn out, so I decided to to take a chance on this one. I don't actually do any gaming, so I can't speak to its qualities in that regard, but it is very responsive and, above all, very comfortable in the hand. It fits well for those who prefer a palm grip rather than a claw-style grip on their mouse.One thing to be aware of: When Corsair says this mouse is Bluetooth 4.0, they do mean 4.0. It won't work with older Bluetooth versions. I suspect this is because older versions cannot guarantee sufficient responsiveness. It is not a big drawback, as they do include a USB dongle that works well out of the box, no special drivers required (standard USB HUD drivers will work, and pretty much any modern OS has that support built in.)I haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, although I am a bit concerned that the nice LED light show must drain the battery a bit. The LEDs are programmable, but that brings me to the other shortcoming I've noticed: The Corsair iCUE software is Windows only. I'm on a Mac; to change these settings, I'd have to go pair the mouse up with a Windows system and install the iCUE software there. Not the end of the world, but better cross-platform support would've been nice.All in all, though, it's a comfortable mouse, it fits well in the hand, it seems sturdily built, and I like that they offer three ways to connect: Bluetooth 4.0, USB dongle, or hardwired via a USB cable.",
          "Amazing mouse great build superior quality",
          "perfect mouse for gaming and or long usage. feels great in your hand. download the software and you have full control.",
          "We bought two of these, one for each of my sons. They loved them and they worked great for about a year of regular computer gaming but each of them noticed problems from them at about the year mark. The problems tend to be with the actual main mouse buttons that you click. On one mouse, when he clicks, it actually double clicks from time to time. On the other, it doesn't read when he holds the mouse button down (like for a stream of bullets in an fps), even when click and holding the button, it only reads as a single click that was let go of right after if that makes sense.Everything else about them they loved. The customizability, the feel, the look, the different usage modes. Its just the durability and longevity that suck with this. Especially since we got each for $90 brand new.",
          "This is the final mouse I am buying from Corsair.  I love the company, they make great hardware, but their mouse lineup continue to disappoint me.  I have a history with Corsair and buying their mice.  From the top, I have bought an M90, an M60, an M65, the Corsair Sabre/Corsair Sabre Wireless, and now this one.  The Dark Core is my most recent and it is just confirming I will not buy another mouse from Corsair. They do not have durability.  Let me explain my experiences.Every mouse I mentioned had an issue.My M90 died from a scroll wheel issue with the firmware.  You could not scroll anymore with it.My M60 stopped right clicking.My M65 got stuck in a permanent DPI of 100 (it had a sniper button that eventually got jammed into a \"always on\" state.  You could not change the DPI even through software or using a another mouse to change it.My Sabre and Sabre Wireless would always create a ghost \"double click\" when left clicking.  Meaning, if you left click once on something, it had a chance to trigger it twice.  I ran numbers on this chance and it was about 30% of the time.  The regular Sabre did this, so I rebought a wireless version and after a week it did the same thing.And now it comes to the Dark Core.  I figured, stupidly, that throwing some more cash at a higher end mouse would remedy my situation, as I would love to continue my loyalty for the company.  But no.  Absolutely not.This mouse is one of the absolute worst mouse I have ever owned.  It kind of is an amalgam of some of the issues of my previous mice.It triggers the double click issue like my Corsair Sabres.It has DPI issues, stuck at a low DPI when I log and and it takes several minutes for it to trigger back to normal, which reminds me of my M65.  This is a problem centered on how fast the Corsair ICUE software boots up.It has a right clicking issue like my M60.  While not completely broken, you have to find the right area of the button to click to make it work.But the most aggravating issue of this mouse?  The left clicking.All of these above issues I can work with, but this is the most egregious.The only way to left click on this mouse for me is to click on the very front of the mouse.  If you click in the middle or on the top it will not register.I'm not going to get into a deeper rant, but I am just going to say this is the last mouse I am buying from Corsair. I could go into how this mouse's battery life is horrendous, how the Corsair ICUE firmware updates can make or break a device, or how just about how it works with the ICUE software in the first place, as those are also valid complaints of mine, but in hindsight I am always having the worst luck getting a mouse from this company to last at least over a year.This one I bought a few months ago and has delivered a underwhelming and frustrating experience.",
          "If the life span was that of a god then this would my be my last mouse. \ud83e\udd1f(doubt it though)",
          "Love that I can go wireless even though it drops the response time but that\u2019s a given",
          "The mouse is great in hand, works well most of the time, but sometimes it can drop its connection and not pick up for a second. This may be due to it being below my desk on the keyboard tray, as when I use it on the top of the desk it doesn\u2019t seem to have that issue- the battery life is great and I can go a day or two without having to plug it in while doing more intense gaming.",
          "this mouse is pretty good some times on wake it takes a second to sync correctly but only like 1 second i have seen it choke here and there but only when i pair it with a wireless keyboard (might be because adapters are pluged in right next to each other) when paired with my wired keyboard it stays fine i am over all happy with it the icue works great with my icue fans. i use this to replace my death adder razor mouse. now i am looking at replacing my razor keyboard with a k100 but have not pulled that trigger yet  it feels heavy and i love that. the pinky rest.... oh my the pinky rest how have we lived this long without them. dpi is fine i can spoon it with big hands ... well if you are on the fence i would say get it if you want a light mouse this is not for you.",
          "I had a logitech g502 and thought it was the best mouse ever. But my ring and pinky finger always slid around on the mouse pad cuz it was so skinny. I have normal sized hands and still felt i wanted a wider mouse with 2 wings. My buddy has this mouse and told me about it. I immediately knew it was the mouse for me. After recieving it, it is literally the best mouse ever. If this one wver breaks i will just buy another. The 2 wings are perfect, and it is a wider mouse that fills the palm of your hand, and is ergonomic. The curve is perfect on top, the dps buttons arent in the way like the g502. I always would accidentally press the dps buttons in the middle of a foght on the g502. They wers just poorly positioned and the buttons were too sensitive. On this mouse its much harder to hit them and theyre not as sensitive if you do accidentally touch them in the middle of a battle. I love this mouse so much, im writing a review and i never do. If yall are looking for a mouse to fill your hand perfectly and have long battery life, get this mouse and tell me i told you so when you fall in love with it!!",
          "Purchased to replace a Redragon Vampire Elite that only lasted a week.  Paying the extra $40 to get this Corsair mouse was worth every penny.  It was easy to setup with my existing Slipstream receiver that was used with my corsair headset.  Easy to manage in Icue.  Easy to swap out the finger rest on the right side due to it being held on with a magnet.  Storage for the Fob that cam with the mouse under the removable finger rest.Would highly recommend this mouse and the vendor.",
          "Purchased on a whim after handling one in BestBuy. I like the way it feels in my hand and especially the finger rests on both sides. I do use it for gaming some but mostly it's my favorite daily driver, browsing etc. The lights on the mouse are great, very bright. Aesthetically, I love it. For gaming? Meh. Not terrible but man is it heavy! Also, after buying 3 Corsair mice recently (M65, Darkcore, Ironclaw, all wireless) the Corsair sensor just doesn't feel as good to me as Logitech's sensor. I was using a G502 and (still use) a G903 for a few years. Those three Corsair couldn't be any more different in how they feel grip wise but, I am trying to figure out what type of mouse felt the best in my hand. I am still going to try a few others in search for the perfect mouse (Glorious and SteelSeries).  I would definitely recommend the Darkcore but if you are going to be playing FPS games be warned, it is heavy. Battery lasts about 2-3 days between charges and has been difficult to adjust to after using the Logitech G903 which lasts weeks between charges. The RGB lights on the Corsair mouse are worth it.",
          "I use my mouse a lot, for work and for play. I didn't want a mouse, I wanted a hand couch that had enough buttons to meet my gaming needs but not so many it made question my life decisions. It was a tough decision between this and the Roccat Kone AIMO Remastered. I actually acquired both and I have to give it Corsair; the wireless option, the decent charging speed, and the slightly increased weight made the difference.If you too suffer from hand cramps due to TMS(Tiny Mouse Syndrome) and are looking for something you can comfortably and effectively use for hours...this is it. My absolute favorite hand couch.",
          "This mouse is everything I ever wanted in a wireless mouse! Very comfortable, great to look at... The RGB lighting is very stylish.  While gaming, the mouse is very responsive and I have had no latency issues with it.  The only draw back with this mouse is Rechargeable Battery Life.  However, I dropped a USB-C cable down by my monitor, and I throw it on the charger every 3rd night, and I have a full charge ready to go when I come back to the office.  I would prefer a longer battery life, but its fair trade off for what you get otherwise.  I am still using it and will continue !",
          "I do like the weight it has and the ergonomics, the Bluetooth can be spotty, mine lags sometimes if you don't move it for a couple of minutes, but once it fully reconnects it works fine. It works better when wired.Initially, the battery wouldn't last and it would stay on even after you leave it for more than 30 minutes, lately, it shuts off more often and since then the Bluetooth issue stated.but all and all it's a great device.",
          "As overall i do like the mouse. However there are some pretty severe glitches in the wireless aspect of this mouse connectivity. Sometimes it will just totally not respond for a couple seconds. Other times it will jump like no tomorrow. The wired aspect is 1000x smoother and is why wireless mice are TERRIBLE. I do like the addon for the mouse so your whole hand is on the mouse and not part of it resting on the mousepad it's self which makes for a nice smooth glide when playing fps",
          "Seems to work great.  But, not always working.  Figured out it was the radio communication.Was having intermittent failures.  Jumping.  I thought it was a dirty sensor.  Was acting like when a piece of lint gets stuck in the eye.  Cleaning the pad and mouse made no difference, but plugging it in immediately stops any problems I\u2019m having.  Moved the receiver from the back of my case to the front and it seem to have cleared up.I\u2019ve used radio based keyboards and mice before and have never had problems like this.  I\u2019ve used them on the coffee table connected to an enclosed 3 meter distant media machine and worked fine.  If I find I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll repost.  I am running a lot of accessories (I use all my pcie slots.), RGB, pci wifi, thunderbolt hub etc. And my mesh hub is also nearby... maybe one or multiple of these things is interfering in an atypical way.Edit:  seems that it was a problem with the radio signal.  Works fine as long as I\u2019m less than 6 feet away.  Like I said.  It may be a noisy box relative to some.  But not an issue I\u2019ve run into before.  Tested an old Logitech wireless and it works fine.  Anyway.  It\u2019s great but for that, which isn\u2019t a true problem more than just a niggle.  Few will need it to work across a room.  I happen to have my computer fairly remote using thunderbolt.  So I just plugged the receiver into the desk hub instead of the computer case proper.",
          "I order mine before reading the available reviews on Amazon which disappointed me even before getting the mouse that I paid such a price for a piece of junk. I don't know if its a matter of different opinions or people received damaged products because mine arrived perfectly fine and I gotta say no dollar was wasted on this mouse.Now to counter the available reviews with mine (for the sole of clarifying couple of points) :pros1. The mouse battery life is really long even on wireless to the point I didn't even bother trying the bluetooth mode.2. the mouse weight is average not being too heavy nor light it feels perfect for controlling in both RPG and FPS games.3. The response time is crazy this is my first time trying a wireless mouse before that I tried a BT mouse 14 years ago(HORRIBLE experience)4. it feels nice on the grip and has a nice touch although I wouldn't recommend it for people with small hands (especially kids).Cons but not really cons1. For people with medium sized hands like me you would fine the pinky rest that comes in the box with it useless since your pinky would never reach it unless you try hard then it wouldn't be a pinky rest anymore.2. Not a big fan of plastic would've preferred more rubber considering that cleaning plastic is hard without leaving scratch marks on it ,but then again it wouldn't have this special look to it anymore .",
          "The first thing I did was get the mouse connected to my PC over bluetoooth, no problem. I installed iCUE and when I opened it, it did not show the mouse. The mouse was working fine! I watched a youtube video and discovered it had to be plugged in via USB before iCUE would see it. What? I plugged it in and then iCUE could see it. Not kidding.It gets worse. I am familiar with how to configure the mouse buttons using Logitech's software and figured iCUE would be similar. Wrong. They took the Microsoft approach and made it as cumbersome as possible. Not only do you have to create a profile for the setup, that is for a game or such, you also have to create profiles for each button within that profile that you wish to change. And changing a button's function is not intuitive, and takes some clicking around to figure it out.Here's the icing on the cake. I could see that the mouse had old firmware and decided to load the newest one via iCUE. It's still connected via USB so all should have to do is click the update button and wait for it to happen. Wrong again! It has to be connected via the WiFi adapter to perform a firmware update! Not kidding!!!The iCUE software is VERY slow. Perhaps it's written in something lame like LabView.  I'm a software engineer and very critical of stuff like this. If the app is this bad, I suspect the firmware in the mouse is just as bad, possibly worse.The mouse itself seems fine, feels good, and connects quickly over bluetooth. It was half the price of a Logitech mouse I had my eye on, so I'm going to keep it for a little while and then decide if I will keep it or send it back.--- Edit ---I thought I'd give it another try and decided to edit the button definitions for playing Space Engineers. When I connected the mouse via USB cable and opened the iClueless software, it showed up as blank. There are supposed to be three profiles, and instead I saw none. All of my previous button definitions were gone. So I reprogrammed them, and set DPI up as \"f\" and DPI down as \"g\". I opened Notepad and hit DPI up and got an \"f\" - yea! I clicked DPI down and got an endless repeating string of \"g\"s that wouldn't stop until I clicked another button. Maybe it was a quirk. I tried it again and got one \"f\" and \"ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg\".What a piece of crap. I'm returning it.At twice the price a Logitech mouse is a far better deal. If all you care about are pretty lights, then this mouse might just work for you.",
          "Right off the rip... battery only lasts maybe 5 days, with normal use. Few hours a day. Absolutely tragic. Best part, you get no warning, no popup or flashing LED's to let you know to plug in. It just dies, and in my case usually mid game. I've had it a couple weeks, and now I just leave it plugged in and use it as a wired mouse. Corsair support stated this is average... that sure as heck isn't what they advertise though. Scummy marketing tactics, no where even close to 50 hours of battery they claim. I average about 20-25 hours. Mouse is set to 2000hz, 800dpi, LED lights are static colors for reference. This is the first, and last wireless mouse I will buy. Since well.. it's wired to me anyway. I paid for a feature and barely get to enjoy it.iQue software needs an overhaul, it's not very intuitive and likes to freeze, or just straight up not respond sometimes.Otherwise, solid mouse. Feels really good in the hand, comfortable. I wish the pinky wing was larger though, my pinky is always falling off, unless I death grip the mouse, I can't just relax and expect my finger to stay on. Mouse wheel is S tier, perfect amount of resistance between rotational notches. All the buttons feel amazing, the thumb buttons are perfectly placed. the 2 buttons next to left click, need a redesign though, I have to overly bend my index finder to use the one closer one and it''s just not natural. Which is weird, the rest of the mouse just melts perfect in my hand.",
          "I always try to stick with Corsair stuff for my PC, got this wireless mouse and its awesome. DPI sensor is nice, scroll wheel feels great and the battery stays charged for a long time, then you just plug it in and charge it. Amazing wireless mouse from Corsair!",
          "Awesome mouse! I have had it for 1 year, 6 months and have not had a single issue. Works just like it did on day one so I'm not sure how people are having squeaking issues or clicking problems. Maybe just luck of the draw.Looks beautiful too with it's RGB and enough programmable buttons for the average gamer and you can make different button maps that you can cycle through via the top button just behind the scroll wheel. Battery lasts a good while and is never an issue for me.My only gripes are that 1) for my hand it's slightly too small so that when I hold it comfortably my fingers hang off the edge. My hands are absolutely average male size hands (I'm 5'9 and my hands match my body), and 2) I wish it had more sensitivity levels to cycle through (3 levels).",
          "This is the most comfortable mouse I have ever had.  I also love that I can have the mouse plugged into a separate usb port and just put the dongle usb in my laptop.  So I have one less wire attached to my laptop.I have three of these now and my original one is still working fine and the left click mouse button is not worn out yet after almost 3 years.  I gave up on Logitech mice because the left click button wore out in about 6 months.",
          "This mouse is very versatile.  It can be connected with the wire, bluetooth or RF.  I don't like the mouse battery dying so I choose to connect with the wire.",
          "The mouse is comfortable to use, although it is larger apparently in comparison to Logitech Anywhere MX 2S.It supports RGB lighting, key mapping, Qi charging and Bluetooth, that is rather uncommon on the market. (There are few alternatives)For my use case, the mouse has 2 issues.Firstly, and also the key issue, it cannot be connected to iPadOS 15 over Bluetooth. I did not try to do so on iOS but I believe it cannot be done as well. I have a couple of Bluetooth mouse and keyboard (Logitech MX 2S, Logitech On-The-Go, Microsoft Arc Mouse, some un-branded Bluetooth mouse). All can be connected to iPadOS over Bluetooth. This Corsair mouse is really odd and I feel very disappointed. :(The second issue is about the grip of the mouse body. It is made of hard plastic. My personal preference is soft plastic coating just like the one on Logitech MX 2S thumb grip position.",
          "They feel of this mouse was pretty good, I have medium sized hands and this mouse fit them perfectly! The RGB accents are a nice touch, although obviously unnecessary and a killer on battery life.I purchased this along side a Logitech G502 wireless to decide which one I like best to replace my aging fleet of Logitech G700s'.My decision to not go with the Corsair came down to just 2 things.But first, let me say that one of the main reasons this mouse was picked for the final defeat was because of its looks, the RGB looked pretty badass (yeah I know, doesn't do anything! ) and because my PC I built last June is full of Corsair parts. The power supply (which also connects to iCue for monitoring), the case, all 8 of the case fans, the AIO cooler, the RAM sticks, my K95 keyboard and obviously the commander pro and Lightning node pro.Back to the mouse- so reason 1 is the scroll wheel doesn't have side click buttons. My old mouse and the G502 I decided to go with both have programmable buttons on each side of the scroll wheel and I've gotten so used to using them for going forward and backwards on web pages that I don't want to go back to having to move the mouse to do that haha.The other reason, and much more serious reason is iCue......Corsair for whatever reason,  kept the interface for programming the mouse pretty much the exact same as all of their lighting products.Despite having used iCue for several years with my K95 keyboard,  I was completely lost when it came to trying to program some simple commands on the mouse. Another thing that is pretty irritating to me, is when you change the function of a button on the mouse, iCue will continue to label the button as it's ORIGINAL FUNCTION!!For example, one of the top left buttons from the factory is DPI up. If you were to simply swapit around and change it to DPI down....well from then on when you open iCue and look at the mouse layout on the screen, the button will continue to be labeled as DPI Up.I hate using iCue to program a mouse and it needs a TON of work to get on Logitech's level",
          "it dies really fast compared to other wireless mice i have had but i like the mouse overall",
          "My grandson loves the mouse, and asked me to buy a usb splitter.",
          "EDIT: I started having connection issues with this mouse after a firmware update. After going back and forth with Corsair support for a few weeks, they were nice and helpful, they would not believe me that iCue and the firmware update were the issue. I bought a Razer setup and the problem cleared up immediately.I spilled coffee on my first one and didn't hesitate to replace it immediately. It's a heavier mouse, but it's great for medium to large hands. It feels good in the hand, the clicks are satisfying and the button placement is great. Icue is also pretty solid.",
          "There I was. Another bright afternoon in my village, gentle snow falling from the sky, a notification that my mouse had arrived. I grab the box, look to the sky, taking a big fresh breath of winter air. I take my box inside, open it with the excitement of a child on Christmas morning, and the horror that awaited me knew no bounds. I take the mouse hence, and find it is used. Not lightly used, either. It still had the gamer dorito gunk in the crevices and the hard spots to clean. A slight bubble in the right side where it had been exposed to use/heat. As I bear to witness this horror, the cry of anguish escaped from me, unable to hold back. I sit, mouse in hand, confused. What happened to this mouse? Why did it make it to me? How could I have been so deceived? These questions I will ask forever, and will haunt my every online purchase decision I ever make.TL;DR: I ordered a new mouse, and received a used one filled with gunk.",
          "This is only the second wireless mouse I have ever owned. The first was a Razer Ouroboros and that lasted me a good 4-5 years. The first 3 1/2 years went fine without a problem and the first thing to fail was the battery. No problem, I'll just use it wired. Awesome until the end of its life.Now I have owned mostly wired mice from Corsair and they haven't lasted me nearly as long as my Razer Ouroboros. The last one before my current Dark Core Pro RGB SE was the M65 Pro RGB and that was fine until the scroll wheel and the right click started squeaking about a year and a half later after some mid to heavy use gaming. Before the M65 Pro RGB, I was rocking the Glaive for about 2 years and the problem was the right click also being squeaky.I finally decided  to purchase a wireless mouse once again since wireless mice have become a lot faster in polling rate and provide less input lag now, barely-even noticeable between my M65 Pro. I purchased this mouse on April 8th and it arrived April 11th. I specifically bought the SE version to also use my wireless charger that I already owned.Here I am ONE MONTH later and these are the problems I've have with it:-Right-click squeaking when playing something like League of Legends-Mouse wheel squeak when just browsing the internet-Battery drain is too fast, lasts about 2 days max of medium to heavy use-In wireless dongle mode, I sometimes get weird stutter like a slight disconnection despite being only like 2ft. away from the dongle itself-In wired mode, same stutter. I've updated iCue software, reinstalled iCue, reinstalled drivers for dongle and mouse but no change-One night I left my mouse charging overnight on my wireless charger and not only did it not charge, it also overheated and was pretty hot to the touch. I let it cool for about an hour and just now charge it with the included USB-C cable.Here are the good things that I like about the mouse when I initially got it:-Very comfortable to use for long periods of time, I would say my grip is between a palm grip and fingertip grip-Super responsive, setting the polling rate to 2000Hz and giving the mouse the 0.5ms made the mouse feel amazing-RGB looks pretty-The placement of the two buttons on the left-click is great for assigning stuff like pings or interacts in games like League, CoD:Warezone, Apex, and OW-The included grip on the right side makes it more comfortable for me personally, I love side grips like the Ouroboros-USB-C connection on the mouse itself is really nice to have-Wireless charging was great when it worked and didn't overheat my mouse-iCue is great for everything from setting macros or assigning buttons to the mouse"

          "I loved this product since the first moment I saw it. Works just perfect and I have no regrets",
          "I absolutely love Corsair products and this model of mouse, my previous M65 lasted over 6 years of constant hard  gaming, clicking and normal wear and tear...it gamed until the buttons had no spring left. As I was impressed with the quality and feel/performance of it I went  back to the same model since I loved it so much and so I expected the same quality. Low and behold less than 5 months after purchasing and receiving my new M65 the left mouse button crapped out and would no longer click rendering it useless. It has a 1yr limited warranty so I contacted Corsair directly and went through their month long process. If you don't have a standby mouse you may be SOL while you pay to ship their defective product back to them and wait for a new one or you can beg to have them send you a new one ASAP by paying full price for it and still pay return shipping for their broken product... ultimately having your \"full price\" money refunded once they get the defective unit and \"test\" it to make sure it was not fowl play. Got my new mouse shipped and refund for the expedited shipment of the replacement unit about 20 days after my claim was opened.Here we are 9 months after the second \"new\" mouse arrived and I am starting to experience similar issues, loss of clicks for both right and left clickers. I'm disappointed in the quality of this product since the original M65 I had lasted so long, at this point the M65 should be taken off the market if it's consistently having the same issues with multiple different \"new\" mice and other customers who experience the same defects(check the reviews for the Corsair M65). I'll blame poor quality control, quality in general and lack of interest in fixing the existing problem with this model...PROS:Great mouse for smaller/shorter handsPrice is not to bad for a simple gaming mouseGood for RPG, MMO's and FPS (plenty of side buttons to assign keys without going overboard)RGB programmable with HUE along with key binding and custom DPI settings1 year limited warrantyCONS:Left click is first to go every timeAbsolute poo reliability in qualityDoes not stand up to older versions of the M65Pricey for something that lasts 5 months if not moreWarranty does not cover return shipping for defective products or quick replacement(have a back up mouse ready)",
          "I've bought this mouse three times over the course of four years or so. I use it for about eight hours a day, it sees heavy usage during these eight hours, and lasts me about a year which is amazing considering how much I put it through the works. Although this next part is relative to personal preference, I don't think the mouse weighs a lot, even if it was too light, it comes with adjustable weights - of which I'm perfectly fine using the default weight parameters. After the first time I bought it I went with some Red Dragon models which are, for the price, amazing; however, those mice are a gamble - they can either last as long as this mouse or barely last a few months whereas the three times I've bought this product, it has stood an average of 9 months to a year's duration.The buttons are easy to get adjusted to, the DPI change is uniform to the mouse chassis and in a decent spot, I've never found myself accidentally changing the DPI - and if this is a problem, the mouse has a software interface where you can disable all other settings profiles. The side keys are macroable to other functions outside of the industry standard input so you don't need to mess around with editing the device through other means.Fair price, fair product, I wouldn't know what the best mouse is as its all relative to style, use, and preference - but if I had my way, for the way I do things - this mouse is more than enough. Obviously not the best for MMOs due to its lack of buttons but yeah... thoroughly recommend this mouse if you do a lot of traveling across your mouse pad - does really well at not \"eating\" into the surface. Would buy again, and again, and again.",

          "I ordered this mouse as a combo with a Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Low Profile Keyboard.  I ordered them to replace an old Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that I was constantly switching from my gaming PC to my Laptop.  That way I could leave the Wireless mouse on the laptop and the new corsair stuff on the gaming PC.Right after I ordered the corsair mouse and Keyboard the USB Dongle for my wireless equipment started having connection issues.  Amazon decided to ship the mouse separately from the keyboard and mouse wasn't going to arrive until Wednesday.  The Problem with that was that I needed a mouse for work so I went to a local store and bought a second mouse.  I bought the Dark Core RGB Pro wireless mouse for use with my laptop.If I hadn't bought that Dark Core mouse then this would have been a 5 star review.  The M65 Elite is still a great Mouse it feels very Crisp and tracks very well.  I just love the way the Dark Core Feels and fits in my hand so much better.  They are both great Gaming mice and I would recommend either one if you were thinking about buying on.",
          "Realmente todo la comodidad la respuesta y durabilidad de su pila..",
          "PROS (good things -- cons will be further below)--> Mouse buttons on the side are amazing -- there are three and each is easy to reach/press and I never feel like I'll hit the wrong one on accident. When compared with the side buttons on the Deathadder for example (my last mouse), I much prefer these. Notably, these can be rebound using corsair's iCUE software if you don't want to use them for dpi switching,etc.--> Great look/appearance -- sharp mouse overall--> Mouse feet on this seem wonderful -- my last mouse a deathadder wore the 3 mouse feet down over time, but these seem much larger/more sturdy to me.CONS:--> I have large hands and the mouse isn't as comfortable for me in palm grip as some other mice like the new Deathadder. My pinky also sorta awkwardly hangs off the side -- not a deal breaker, but I would consider the palm grip less comfortable on this mouse than the deathadder personally. Claw grip on this seems perfectly fine though if that's what you use.--> I do not like the weights/screws underneath -- for me, when the weights in IN, the screws don't go totally flat against the bottom -- they protrude a bit. This really worries me since those screws have rough/gapped heads and I hear them sometimes drag against my mousepad despite the great feet on this mouse. When removed, you have these big gaping holes there and really what I'd like is just for the weights to not even be there -- would prefer the screw holes (they're very large) just be the same flat slick material as the rest of the bottom to better help the mouse glide -- that's my two cents. I've also had trouble when screwing these in where they seem to sometimes leave uneven amounts of space on their sides and it's just something that's been an inconvenience more than a feature -- especially considering the weights seem to hardly weigh anything at all from what I can discern. At the very least, with the weights in, these screws should absolutely go flat against the bottom and not stick out a bit I think.",
          "I do use the computer a lot, but I'm disappointed because at this point the left button is flaky. I seem to be able to destroy mice buttons a lot. This is not the first mouse that a mouse was unable to take the abuse of my right index finger. I'm waiting for someone to come up with a button that will last.",
          "It all started with a google search. I realized that my hands are above average (in a significant margin, at that) and that if I wanted to comfortably hold a mouse similar to the Corsair I already have that is aging and rough and filled with lots of small cracks and crevices for dust and gunk to build up, I should probably stick with a Corsair mouse. But I figured I'd check the market at large. As such, I came across a variety of sites recommending the Corsair M65 RGB Elite - they claim that it's perfect for the widest and largest of hands, that its weight is comfortably heavy and adjustable, that it's good for a goofy gamer like me.Now that I have it and have had a chance to mess around with it, I'm incredibly disappointed. Those reviews may have been for an earlier revision, a different edition, or some other product entirely and just relabeled to the closest thing. This mouse is by no means comfortable for a large hand. It's wider, by a slim margin, over another gaming mouse I have been trying to get away from - Razer's Basilisk Hyperspeed. It has a comfortable thumb groove but right where my thumb rests, the sniper button sits waiting for me to gently squeeze and throw my DPI into the garbage. It's almost flatter feeling than the other gaming mouse, even with all the rounded curves to it, and it hugs the mousepad close enough that a wind turbine at high speed would have a hard time pushing it away. The RGBs on it are pretty okay. The trails of light coming from the ass end like it's trying to turbo boost through rainbow space is pleasing to the eye but hell if you're trying to sleep with it on in the same room.All of that complaining aside, my major gripe is that there's just no grip and the 'weight' is laughable.Grip - As mentioned above, it's a smallish/average mouse. It's kind of flat, so if you have big hands like me, palm-gripping this thing means it's not in contact with the table/mousepad/whatever. Claw-gripping, wherein only the tips of your fingers and the edge of your palm is in contact with the mouse is a little bit more manageable, but because there's no real grip you're going to be holding it with a bent ring finger to try and keep it stable while your pinky either drags across the mouse or it's hoisted in the air like it's tea-time. If you're a tip-gripper, where you only hold a mouse with the very tips of your fingers, this might be okay. I still end up with my pinky in the air just because there's no place to rest it on this thing.Weight - When fully loaded, the mouse is just as heavy as any other mouse you have on your desk (assuming you're not using something that's purposefully lightened). Removing the weights, I found that each weight is roughly 3.5g and each screw is around 1.5g. The mouse, when fully loaded, weighs in at 110g (not counting the cord). That means you can drop the weight to 95g. By comparison, my previously beloved Corsair, without any weight adjustment options, comes in at 107g and the mouse I'm trying to move away from weighs in at 109g. If you're grabbing this mouse because you think it will be chunky and heavy and comfortable to move, you will be disappointed.Overall, it's an okay mouse. It does what a mouse is supposed to do and, allegedly, it has decent dpi. I don't believe it's worth buying, though, as it does not live up to its advertising (even without the 'reviews' from other sites). If you have small hands, if an increase of 5g or so over your other mice is noticeable, AND if you like the aesthetics, go for it. If you don't fit all of those criteria, though, don't bother.",

          "I really wanted to like this mouse. It's not very comfortable, it misses (doesn't register) clicks often. I normally plug it in to use as I didn't want to accidentally leave the wireless dongle (I use the mouse for travel), however, my first (and, at this point, last) time I tried to use this wireless,  it's losing connectivity every reboot. It doesn't reconnect unless you unplug, then re-plug the dongle. The journey for a mouse that doesn't suck continues.",
          "I'm not having left-click issues like other reviews have stated, but I'm still having hardware issues. For me it's the DPI adjustment buttons and LED. Neither of the buttons work and the LED doesn't light up. This means I can't adjust my DPI settings with just the buttons, and I also don't know what my current DPI is set to. I'm guessing the entire connector to that part of the mouse or something is bad, because I don't know what else could cause two whole buttons and an LED to stop working. I've had this mouse for a few months and I just recently noticed that the LED wasn't lit up, and then I found out the DPI adjustment buttons weren't doing anything. I don't know how, but everyone seems to have the exact same situation, where the mouse will work for a while then it will just break.Using the mouse itself is pretty good. I like how it feels and I get along well with it during games. I'm just starting to lose faith in Corsair because this is the second mouse I've bought from them that's had hardware defects. I don't want to switch all of my peripherals but if I can't buy a decent mouse from Corsair then I'm not left with much of a choice.",
          "I like the mouse a lot. It feels nice and the buttons are easy to push. One thing I do not like about it is that the right mouse button is super sensitive. Just the slightest touch from my finger and the button activates. It has messed me up so many times while gaming. I have to hover my middle finger over the button all the time to keep from pressing it.",

          "I've been using it for a couple weeks now and this is the best mouse I've used for gaming. I bought it to replace a Logitech G502 that the mouse wheel broke on, and I honestly like it more. Functionally, I do miss the fast-scroll button on the G502, but everything else is comparable, and I prefer the iCUE software suit for it over Logitech's program, especially since I'm already using a Corsair headset that uses it as well. You can easily program different lighting effects and DPI settings that can be easily switched with two different buttons (no cycling through pre-sets with only one button).It cannot be understated how sexy this mouse looks and feels. It's narrowly tapered at the back which feels good in my hand, the top of the mouse is a silky smooth rubber surface which feels good on the palm and fingers, the scroll wheel is nice and chunky with a rubber covering in the middle, and the sides of the mouse are a textured surface that provides a good grip. The outer surface is a beautiful jet black while the underside has a brushed steel look. The corsair logo and scroll wheel have vibrant LEDs that you can customize, and at the very back of the mouse is a customizable LED behind a grill that projects light behind the mouse with a very cool effect.This thing looks, feels, and works fantastic, and it cost me less than $50. Easily my favorite gaming mouse I've owned.",

          "I moved to this mouse out of curiosity and just to \"try a new mouse\" from my well worn and loved Logi G502. Now I know mice are mainly subjective to personal taste (within reason). But I do find that this mouse is slightly less responsive left click until I completely removed all Logitech drivers and the corsair program isn't as smooth as Logitech's (just personal taste). Overall it IS a good mouse but I had some difficulty ensuring responsiveness but functions fine once I realized and removed old drivers.Personally I would stick with the G502 as it served me well over the years and prefer the logi software. (purely my preference, let me be clear both are worth a try and I don't dislike this one but prefer the G502)",
          "So, a lot of the reviews here are are purposed to explain that after 3 months you should expect the contact switch in the left mouse button to fail, leaving the clicks spongier, occasionally double clicking. That hasn't been the case for me. I checked my cable, as most of the other reviewers had, and as most of the reviewers had acknowledged I too have the Chinese made switches. The Japanese omron switches are supposed to be the more robust switches. I am experiencing this issue when right-clicking, however. I don't attribute that to the manufacturer or anyone else involved in the development of this mouse, though, because it started after I slammed the mouse down on my desk. So you have to wonder why so many people are complaining of clicking issues in their reviews. I game and use this mouse every day.Review/Experience: The switches that actuate the right and left mouse buttons are very fragile, as other reviews have stated, but under normal wear they should hold up longer than those alarmist reviewers are saying; 3 months. I'm going on 6 months (daily use) and my left clicking is still tactile and my busted right mouse actuator doesn't double click - it's just spongy. I haven't played a game where I've been able to map the crosshair button. I don't know what it is or why its there, and I don't care. It looks cool, I guess. It's awkward to reach it if you have small hands. The platforms on the bottom of this mouse that allow it to slide across your desk smoothly (I don't know what they're called) are the best I have seen on a mouse. They're very thick and also recessed into the aluminum, and will more than likely outlast all of the other components. If that adhesive ever fails they'll easily survive being peeled off to replace it.Would i buy another? No. After I began reading the reviews I did more research and learned that nearly all the contact switches in mice buttons in semi-high-end to high-end mice these days are being made of softer metal combinations - less resistance - because they're being run on lower power (there is no explanation for these switches receiving less than 20% of the power compared to the switches in older mice, other than for the fact that the materials in these switches are softer metals). Being a softer material, if you press into it too hard it's going to leave an indentation making for a flawed contact point and a spongier feel. At the corporate/R&D level they're being marketed and pushed on the consumers (into consumer products) on a large scale for a more responsive registering of clicks. E sports did this to us, is the takeaway. They don't slam their mice?So no, I wouldn't waste money on another higher-end mouse that is guaranteed to have these fragile switches just because it looks cool or has a unique design, like an aluminum frame.",
          "I bought this mouse to replace a wired version of the exact same type. It has a slightly different feel to the casing, but it's exactly the same shape. There have been no issues with the wireless functionality, and it holds a charge for a long time. It charges from the front, as if it were a wired mouse, and it's completely usable while plugged in. Overall, it's a good mouse and a superior replacement to the wired version.",
          "If you have a Corsair keyboard, download the iCue app at once!  There are so many customizations with the mouse and keyboard it\u2019s so awesome!! This mouse is great once you figure out the little button configurations.A bit pricey but definitely worth it",
          "I'll start with a couple positives before getting into it.Firstly, it looks sleek. Love the design. The little underglow is neat, and the software allows you to do some cool stuff like change color when you click. Overall very neat aesthetic.The side thumb buttons are pretty easy to access, despite their size. I was initially worried about this when looking at mice, but it ended up working out just fine.The DPI settings are nice. You can switch very quickly using the buttons before the mouse wheel. Very handy, easy to access, color coded.My issues comes just after my return window closed. About 2 months into owning it, suddenly it only registered about half my clicks at best. Never dropped it, and I never even press especially hard (which even so, shouldn't matter. Build quality at this price point should account for hard presses). I had a wireless $10 mouse some friends bought me back in ~2014, still works to this day. I may end up going back to it. This mouse lasted 2 months. It still works for sure, but the rate that it ignores clicks is infuriating.TLDR: The mouse excels in every aspect except the build quality. Be very wary about the click power this thing has. I don't know how clicks it is rated for, but it lasted me only 2-3 months before functionality dropped off a cliff.edit: I've learned this is a very common issue with this mouse. Fortunately, that means they are willing to issue a replacement free of charge (including free return shipping) which is awfully kind of the manufacturer. If you order the Amazon, you'll have a digital receipt which makes the return process way easier in case you do run into this issue.",
          "So I guess I'll start off by saying that I really love buying and trying different mice. Right now I have the Razer deathadder elite, Rival 500, Rival 600, logitech, G502,305, alien ware Aw558, Razer Basilisk and this mouse. The corsair M65 elite.The shape of this mouse is VERY different than any other I own, which Is more a preference than anything overly positive or negative. It has a very good Pixart sensor, but it has a weird difference from the mice I have with the same sensor. Ot has a very high lift off distance in comparison to the others. With the Rival 600 having the lowest lod. The M65 also has one of the worst cables. It's very stiff and that's not something you want with a mice you're gonna be gaming with. The Rival 600 again, has the best cable. With its solid rubber cable that's very flexible and the deathadder having the second best cable.The buttons on the M65 elite are very good and some of the best placed buttons on any mouse I have. I do really like the \"sniper\" button that's right under the thumb. That could be again a preference thing and probably depends a great deal on how hard you grip the mouse.The M65 is made with VERY good materials and may well be the best put together mouse I have. I do have the EVGA Carbon X10 that I forgot to mention up top that's very nicely put together.Overall I think this is a mouse you actually need to try instead of basing your decision off of a review. Imo my top mice are probably the deathadder elite, rival 600 and the 305 for people with smaller hands. The deathadder is just hard to beat. It's like the Kalashnikov of mice. Theres always a nee kid on the block all the kids wanna try and the deathadder is always there. Waiting, just as reliable and as great as anything available. Like I said, order one, try it and send it back if you dnt get on with it. It really is a good gaming mouse, that is only going to jive with certain people, looking for a certain shape and button placement.",
          "I'm a programmer, and I also dabble in digital media. This mouse is definitely respectable, but it suffers from key problems, so I don't recommend it.Most importantly, the right click button is too light. Having used a $5 Letton mouse for a couple weeks while Corsair replaced my defective unit (more details below), it was a shock to come back to the Corsair M65. The right click button is way too weak. I'm clicking it multiple times an hour. I'm activating random context menu items and stuff. It's not pretty. Look, I know \u2014 I should just hold up my finger more for 8 hours a day. But for me, this is a dealbreaker.Second: the left click broke after 6 months. It would tactile-click but not actually click unless you pressed harder. The disparity between the feedback click and the actual click is unacceptable. It's like, \"you had one job...\". The switches are OMRON, but I don't know anything about them. Corsair did replace the unit, though I had to pay return shipping and the process took a month (admittedly, the whole world is slowed down right now).One quirk: the serial number is on a tag on the usb cable. A tag... that I cut off immediately. For warranty service you need to have a picture of this tag. I didn't, but they let it slide for me. Bad serial number placement IMO.The materials are good. It doesn't feel cheap. The thumb surface has this slight sand finish that needs to get knocked down a little, but after that it's fine.The RGB lights are always on, even when my computer is suspended, but I suppose that's controlled by a BIOS setting, so this doesn't contribute to the 3/5 rating.",
          "Really intuitive control and a great amount of adaptability. The gesture keys are awesome. With my settings I just tilt the mouse and I can lower or raise my volume without having to lift off the mouse or keyboard. Tracking is impeccable and its structure is great. Lightweight as well, I just use a the provided weight in the back and it is perfectly balanced and stops very well. Slide is the best i've felt.",
          "I own a couple wired M65s and I wanted to grab a wireless one. It's everything I expected it to be. Really enjoying gaming on the M65 wireless.",
          "I will say, I wish this mouse was heavier. The weights don\u2019t really add as much as I\u2019d like in a mouse. But otherwise it\u2019s a great size, the DPI sniper thumb button is in the perfect spot, and the skates smoothly glide across the mouse pad. Corsair\u2019s ICUE software could use some work, but I could set my DPI levels relatively easily and the mouse has worked great for me so far!",
          "I do digital illustration, animation, and special effects. I had done a product search for the best artist mouse and I tried several but none of them were really up to the precision that I need for my work. I then did a search for the best gaming mouse... thinking the realtime time feedback required would be good for what I do. I ended up with the Cosair M65 mouse above, and I'm thrilled with how much easier it is for me to work. And, I'm very happy with how much easier it is on my wrist and arm.",
          "This is my second Corsair mouse and this too is giving me some grief. I've had my Deathadder from Razer for a while then switched over to Steelseries Sensei. Both of these mouse ultimately suffered scrolling issues which I can say it might be my fault for not maintaining well but also I've had them for a combined 10 years.The two Corsair mice I have got into a weird clicking issue where if I click on the left button softly it does not actually click. the sound is there but nothing registers. I play a lot of FPS and city building games so a quick click is important. SO, I tried soft resetting of the mice, reinstalling drivers and iCUE software (if this helps) but nothing worked. Since they were under warranty and I found a lot of articles online saying Corsair mice has clicking issues, I sent it over for repairs. My mouse came back working perfectly fine for 1 day and then this issue started again. At this point, I can't even click anything on the Amazon page without holding it firmly and slowly. Unfortunately, tech support is saying the same thing and I've made up my mind to not use Corsair mouse again.",
          "EDIT: I've dropped my review from 5 stars down to 3. I purchased this mouse in January 2019 and in late October 2019 I started experiencing poor registration of left clicks. First it was very infrequent, and within a matter of days I started noticing it get worse. I'd say at worse it's about 20% of my clicks go unregistered and I have to push considerably harder to get it to click. A super-quick internet search seems to return scores of people with the same problem. I contacted Corsair support about the matter and they've been helpful and reasonably responsive about the issue. I was asked to go through a number of troubleshooting steps, none of which had any effect before I was given an RMA to send the mouse in for repair/replacement. No pre-paid shipping label, though, so I'm out the cash to send it back to them, which sucks. Everything else in the review below still stands, it's a great feeling mouse and I really like it, but there is DEFINITELY some quality control issues going on here.DOUBLE EDIT: Corsair replaced the mouse for me (took about 10 days including shipping time there and back). Return shipping was free. I received a brand-new-in-package mouse that, so far, is functioning flawlessly and feels excellent. I'll give it another 10 months to a year and  hope for the best. Corsair's customer support was good, not great, and I applaud them for standing behind the product and not just pushing me off. I did have to prod the process along though, there was a 2-3 day period where nobody responded to my emails after I provided proof of purchase. All-in-all the experience was good and  I still love the mouse, I just hope this one lasts longer!TRIPLE EDIT: I've dropped it down to 2 stars -- my replacement mouse started having the exact same issues in November 2020. Left clicks stopped registering correctly and the whole switch itself feels mushy. I'm not even bothering with an RMA and this mouse is now going to sit in a box as a \"emergency backup\" wired mouse. I've moved on to a wireless mouse with user-replaceable switches. I'm quite certain that there is extremely poor QC with this mouse and/or the Chinese-made Omron switches. I will confidently say that this mouse is not recommended. It feels good in hand, but the reliability is NOT THERE.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm not a mouse aficionado, nor do I have an extensive list of mice I've used. The Corsair M65 RGB \"Elite\" is replacing my Logitech G502 that I've owned for several years. There's nothing wrong the Logitech mouse and it's served me very well, but I wanted to try something else out for the fun of it and I've had excellent experiences with other Corsair peripherals.The mouse has an excellent in-hand feel. The aluminum frame is a really nice touch and helps the mouse feel solid and not as plastic-y as some other mice I've used. Granted, the part that your hand grips is still plastic, but has a nicer feel all the way around. The top area where your palm and fingers rest has a very slight texture and feels good. The sides are more aggressively textured and remind me a bit of the texture you might find on a handgun grip (or grip tape). The mousewheel has a nice rubber \"tire\" over it with good texturing. It does not have a freewheeling option like the Logitech G502 does, but I never used it anyway, so the loss of feature is meaningless to me. The wheel is significantly quieter than my old Logitech when scrolling, so I really appreciate that. The mouse is quite light, but has adjustable ballast for fine-tuning. I've left all the weights in mine and find it perfectly adequate.If I had to sum up the performance of the mouse in a word, I'd say it's smooth. I find it glides and tracks smoother than other mice I've used. It could be placebo, but I honestly think not. I play a good amount of Overwatch and my go-to hero is Tracer. My accuracy went up a solid 7-10% after dialing this mouse in to my liking (DPI and sensitivity settings). I'd hover between 30% and 33% accuracy and now I'm up as high as 40%. I think the mouse improved my aim and performance.I know the huge trend with PC peripherals right now is RGB LED, and this mouse has it. It's cool and fine, but not a huge selling point for me. For what it's worth it integrates excellently with the Corsair iCUE software and I can sync the LED pattern with my Corsair keyboard. It's a neat little feature, but nothing game-changing. If you love RGB LED there's nothing to hate about this mouse. I do like that the LED shines through some \"grille\" patterns in the aluminum frame and mousewheel instead of just lighting up the Corsair logo. Oh, another little LED touch: since the mouse has 5 programmable DPI settings it has a separately controlled LED on the topside to signify which DPI profile you have loaded. Each setting can be customized in both DPI and color. So as long as you remember which color is related to which setting you can see your DPI at a glance. I think most of us will probably find the setting we like best (mine is 2,400) and leave it there, but if you like to change around and experiment you'll probably like the color-coded feature.My only complaint with this mouse comes in the forward and back buttons on the side. I feel like they are placed just a few millimeters to far backward for my personal liking, but I really like the feel of them. They have a great tactile click and they're shaped well. I'm sure with some more use I'll be very very accustomed to it, but it's just different than I'm used to for now. This mouse fits my hand well, I have small hands (I usually wear a \"Small\" size glove) and I think it's very comfortable for a palm grip. It doesn't feel like a whole-hand mouse; it feels like it's more for fast movement and a lighter grip. If you're a tight-grip, fist-clencher I don't think this mouse would feel all that great.Overall, I really like it and I'm sure this is my new mouse going forward.",
          "This is the second M65 that I am buying. The first one I got was up to 12,000 DPI (the older model) and lasted me for a year before the clicking started to fail (It would double click everything even when i was trying to single click and this led to a ton of issues both in gaming and in regular work and productivity). But despite this, it was a good, dependable mouse while it lasted. The two side buttons I mapped to push-to-talk and melee in my FPS games and it saved my life in more than one situation. So I decided to get the upgraded 18,000 DPI model.So far so good. I'm hoping this one lasts longer than a year. I will say, the lighting is A LOT more muted in this model than the 12k model and I really dislike that actually. I'm spending a lot to get synced up RGB gaming setups, why they would scale the lighting down is beyond me but I consider it counter productive and hate it. So I am bumping off a star for that. I got this on sale for $39.99, and if it lasts a year at that price that's cool but it it lasts less than 6 months I will be disappointed and knock off another star. We'll see how long this one lasts.",
          "Caters more to a claw grip, but I just can't get over the quality of this mouse. everything feels secure and not cheap.",
          "Worked fine for the past 19 months, this month I've gotten way too many double clicks for it to be ignored. I use it for work and play so I expected it to get worn out, but just shy of two years seems weak to me. ICue lighting works well together and while it worked, I loved it (minus the size of the mouse, it was smaller than expected but not unusable). Came from an Ironclaw because was recommended it by a buddy.",
          "\u00a0Been using the m65 pro rgb for the longest time. It's still my favorite mouse. It has the perfect ergonomics for my hand size. Yes, I have tried many other mices and I always ended up going back to the m65 pro rgb. So whenever I see corsair make a newer version of the m65 I would not hesitate to make that purchase. When the m65 elite came out , purchased one and had issues with the left click registering double clicks. So I stopped using the elite and went back to my m65 pro. Just recently found out Corsair came out with a m65 ultra wireless. Bought immediately with same day delivery. Mouse arrives , super excited , decides to try it out. Noticed immediately the left click had some issues. Tested it out some more and nope. There was this physical unresponsiveness to it. Like the best way I could describe it would be ,if you were to rapidly click on the left click it would not feel like it springs back up immediately. Felt mushy as if it were stuck. Right click however, feels fine. I expect it to feel like the left. But it doesn't. That's how I knew something wasn't right. Not sure if that's how its suppose to be but I had just submit a ticket to Corsair and am awaiting a response. I want to see if I just got a dud and they'll rma it with a properly working one. Don't want to waste my efforts in returning through amazon and repurchasing just to get another defected unit. The m65 ultra elite feels identical to the m65 pro which I love.EDIT: I got a replacement from amazon and the left click feels alot better than the one I previously had. However, it does feel alittle off though. Maybe its by design. I've use mices with omron switches before and the omrom switches feel weird on this mouse. The right click feels fine but theres just something about that left click that bugs me. I'm just worried itll give out quicker than i'd like. Would've like the option to swap out switches incase it goes bad like the Asus ROG spathaEDIT: been using this for about a week now and i started noticing major issues. I hope it didnt have to come to this. (SEE VIDEOS) left clicks are now registering as double clicks and sometimes just lightly holding down the left would trigger multiple clicks. Watch the videos fully to see. Its sad to see that I'll have to return this. So disappointed in corsair.",
          "M65 Elite(Forgot I hadn't dropped a review of this one yet, better late than never...)The Basics:Medium mouse with unique shape, 3391 sensor, 50M omrons on primary buttons. Two zone RGB, controllable via software. Time in use prior to compiling review was 8 days.I wanted to view this mouse as a potential G502 killer. Hard to find something with excellent specs for fingertip which also is under 100g and a well-placed sniper button. Really, if you want an accurate sensor and a sniper button from a well known brand, the only other names in town are the G502 and Razer Basilisk. The M65 Elite has the advantage of being lighter than either of those competitors once it loses the adjustable weights.The Good:- Primary Clicks (B+): On the light side of moderate but spammable and quite responsive. Some very slight pretravel on both, but it is minimal. Clicks are rather quiet.- Materials and Build Quality (A): Plastic on top is smooth plastic, coarse plastic on the sides, aluminum on the bottom. The materials themselves feel good and there are no rattles here either. Durability seems like it should be good. Of course in my experience, it\u2019s almost always the scroll wheel that goes first.- Scroll Wheel (B+): has light scroll resistance, steps are more muted than I\u2019d like but they suffice and do not have any play between steps. click resistance is light and the wheel has a pleasant rubber tread.- Mouse Feet (B+): Smooth, fast glide, but with moderate noise. Overall the mouse feet are a positive.- Sensor Tracking (A): Snappy and tracking is outstanding. The 3391 is a joy to use, nailing the sense of being both direct and snappy. I prefer it over the 3360 and lower, as well as the 3389 and HERO sensor. I put it in my personal \"top tier\" in terms of (unscientific) \u201csensor feel\u201d along with the 3366 and Tru Move 3.- Looks. (B) The mouse is kinda sexy. The RGB is beautiful with lots of options. For what it\u2019s worth, the logo is my favorite of any brand and the aluminum accents are well done for what they are, even if I hate the added weight.The Middling:- The DPI Buttons (C): Require moderate force, no accidental actuations, very muted sound but tactility feels cheap. Placement is actually useful in some cases though, which is more than most other mice.- Liftoff Distance (B-): Cannot be adjusted and is on the high side at 2 DVDs, maybe a touch more. I did not find it distracting in-game, nor did I notice it adversely affecting performance, but there\u2019s better out there.- Weight (C): 97-100 g without weights. The mouse feet make it feel lighter than it deserves and it is surprisingly light given how much of the mouse is made of metal. That said, I\u2019m not sure the fact you CAN make a mouse of of metal means you SHOULD.- Grip. (C) Despite the coarseness of the plastic sides, they can be slick with dry hands. Simply breathing on your hands can improve grip considerably.The Bad:- Ergonomics. (C) Rather wide. Best for large claw and large fingertip. The weight and balance make it uninviting for a large palm gripper, but might work for a med-small palm. I gave time to 8 distinct grips with this mouse. While some were effective, and some were comfortable, only one was both effective and comfy. That\u2019s all it takes, but it took a little while to get there\u2026- No access to internals. If you own it for over two years or you want to open it up, good luck. Nothing on the box or documentation states that there are omrons or a 3391 sensor. I\u2019d prefer the specs on the box just like Logitech and not trust the less reliable Amazon storepage which has a bad record. \u201cJust trust me, it\u2019s all in there\u201d doesn\u2019t fly.- Weight system. (C-) Even though you likely won\u2019t be fiddling with the mouse weights on a routine basis, they are clunky. 6 pieces total and requires a flathead screwdriver to get them out in the first place. It may be the least convenient adjustable weight system I\u2019ve seen.- iCue software (C): It has questionable EULA. \u201cWe will collect data from your system, but we promise not to identify you....\u201dit suggests that they do collect data that COULD identify you and that is no good. iCue is very bloated in comparison to offerings from other manufacturers. Basic mouse functions on other mice are handled with software that boots up instantly and weighs in at 4 to 12 MB in size. Even accounting for the increased functionality, there\u2019s no reason (that isn\u2019t suspicious) which would require iCue to be the better part of a gigabyte. ICue is >Terraria in size...- Software UI is horridly unintuitive and a bad pairing for all the features that it is capable of. That said, if you take the time to learn it, there are more lighting and macro options here than any other software platform I\u2019ve seen.- The sniper button is red with a little crosshair icon on it. It\u2019s somewhat tasteful for what it is, but still just gushes \u201cdedicated gamer mouse.\u201d Also, since the sniper button is in a position where some people may want to use its surface to grasp the mouse, the fact that it has a very slick, glossy finish doesn\u2019t help anything. At least the actuation force is high so that you won\u2019t accidentally click it when picking up the mouse.The Conclusion:The M65 Elite is a quality product, but not necessarily a safe purchase. It is a fun mouse, but not a hardcore mouse in my opinion, even if it has \u201chardcore\u201d components. It has aggressive looks that may not be your thing in three years. You might wake up next to it and think, \"was I sane when I made this choice?\" It does not dethrone the G502 as a productivity or gaming mouse primarily due to shape, but it is not a bad mouse and many will be plenty happy with it.The weakest parts of this ownership experience are the shape, followed by the software, LOD and glossy sniper button. The M65 Elite succeeds in being both incredibly sexy and quite unique if you don\u2019t consider the predecessor model. I consider this mouse to be Corsair\u2019s most unique mouse in terms of both shape and looks. Overall, it's good stuff, fun to use, always room for improvement.Bang for $50 Bucks: BNit-Noid Rating: 8.5",
          "I've used a Corsair M65 every day for the last four years as my daily mouse for my home desktop. I use it for gaming, I use it for web browsing, I use it for graphic design, I use it for everything. I have never used or owned a better mouse - there's simply no substitute.I recently decided to order a new one, not because the old one no longer worked (indeed, it still works fine after four years of use and abuse) but simply because I knew they'd made some improvements and I wanted to experience the pleasure of a fresh mouse. Oh man, what a good decision. The current M65 is everything I've loved about the old one for the last half a decade, but refined.You could spend $70+ on a high-end gaming mouse with tons of mappable buttons, but none of them will feel as robust, as comfortable in the hand, or just as RIGHT as the roughly $50 M65. It's got everything you need, and nothing more: left click, right click, scroll wheel, back and forward buttons, and a remappable sniper button (which I always map to the space key).I've also used Corsair's Scimitar, with its twelve mappable keys on the side, but it just isn't as comfortable in the hand, it doesn't feel as robust, and I personally never found the macro keys all that useful - for MMO gaming, I use a gaming keypad in my left hand for all that stuff. All I want my mouse to do is to BE A GOOD MOUSE.The optical sensor has been refined to a ridiculous degree as well. 18,000 dpi, adjustable on the fly. I've found it to be incredibly accurate.Just, get this mouse. It is the best one money can buy, period. You could spend twice, three times as much on a \"high-end\" \"gaming\" mouse and it'll be WORSE than the Corsair M65. Guaranteed.",
          "Since there were some mixed reviews on this mouse, I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review. I've now been using this mouse for ~4 months on my gaming rig. I was going with a white and black theme for my build and, paired with the white version of the Corsair K70 keyboard, this looks great, which is why I bought it in spite of some of the mixed reviews. For reference, I'm a bit picky when it comes to mice... my primary mouse that I use in day-to-day work is a Logitech MX Master 3 which is a pretty premium item, so I'm comparing my experience with the M65 to the MX Master 3.BUILD QUALITY:Overall, pretty solid. I haven't had any issues (yet) with failures with the clicking mechanism that others report. I haven't had any issues with lost inputs, incorrect inputs, etc. The mouse is a little light even with the included weights and has a somewhat cheap feel due to the plastics used, but surprisingly it has held up very well. I like the heft of the MX Master 3 and wish the M65 was a little closer to the Master in that regard, but that's more of a preference than anything else. The braided cord is nice and thick and feels durable. All of the buttons have a satisfying click without any \"mushiness.\" I like the rubberized texture that the sides are coated with and actually wish the whole mouse had this texture - it would make it feel a bit more high quality. The scroll wheel has a very satisfying and precise mechanism, again with no \"mushiness\" that can often come with cheaper mice. All and all, I haven't had any issues with the build quality and would say that's it's pretty solidly built.USE:Again, no issues on this front. Tracking is accurate, and the ability to have multiple DPI presets is a huge plus if you play a lot of different games, which is also made nicer by being able to customize the presets in iCUE. I don't have much use for the \"sniper\" button on the left, which reduces the DPI when held, but it does work if that's your thing. The RGB works well with Corsair's software and I haven't had any problems with iCUE, though I know that's a frequent complaint of Corsair's product line. All of the surfaces are pretty easy to clean (even the rubberized portions), which is nice for keeping it in good shape. The RGB works as expected and matches the rest of my Corsair products. The mouse moves smoothly with the gaming pad that I'm using.PROBLEMS:None, really - I'm pretty happy with this mouse. I haven't had any issues whatsoever. Like I mentioned, I've had zero issues with lost clicks and haven't had any issues with the iCUE software, both of which seem to be the big complaints with this mouse.OVERALL:So far, this is a solid recommendation from me if you're looking for a white \"gaming\" mouse. It performs as I would expect with accurate movements and some nice creature comforts. My only real complaint is the relatively cheap feel due to the light weight and the plastic textures used on most of the body... if Corsair refreshes this model, I would hope for a slightly heavier build - maybe some different weights that can be used? - and maybe \"rubberizing\" the whole body. Beyond that, though, I think this is a solid buy for the price. Very happy with the purchase!** MARCH 2021 UPDATE **Well, unfortunately I started having the issue with unreliable left mouse clicks described in other reviews. It seemed to happen all of a sudden, and the mouse wasn't subjected to any damage - just regular use. The clicking mechanism felt fine, but around a quarter to a third of left clicks didn't register. I ended up just replacing the mouse - a real bummer since I liked the white body as it went well with the rest of my system. It was cheap enough that I didn't even bother trying to RMA it, and frankly it seems to be a fundamental problem with the product and I didn't want to have to continue dealing with this repeatedly.Great while it worked, but a mouse that dies after 12-18 months is a no-go. Reduced my rating to 3 stars.",
          "This has been my only mouse/daily driver for almost two years. For the first 14 months of its time with me it was used extensively for gaming (CoD, Destiny, PUBG). Although I don't play much anymore, I'm in the market for a new mouse so I figured I'd write a review.The good:-Its sexy-I've never had any double click issues as I've seen some mention-Its fast and responsive. I've never felt its performance let me down in any way-having up to 5 preset and easily switchable dpi settings is nice (I really only ever used 2-3)-something else I'm probably forgettingThe bad:-for my hands(8.5\"/4.5\"), it's too small. I have to claw it and that gets tiresome after a few hours-its creaky as heck. The side panels make more noise than a dying cat-iCue is probably as bad as people say it is, but I've done very little with it so I can't really speak to that-glossy side buttons are the worst and no manufacturer should ever put them on a mouse, ever.Conclusion:-For $50 it was a great first mouse for me and if I had smaller hands I'd probably upgrade to the \"ultra wireless\" version, but that's not to say this little guy isn't without its faults. Cheers friends :)",
          "Very nice mouse. I quite like everything about it. It's just sooo small.The M65 is nice and provides great responsiveness, the scroll wheel feels stiff in a good way and the body doesn't seem like it's made of cheap rubber. It's just sooo small. It doesn't fit my hand really at all. I always thought I was a 'claw-grip' guy, but this is uncomfortable for regular use. Gotta say I wish it were bigger.I have a Corsair Scimtar, and it fills my hand much more nicely, but for FPS gaming the buttons can get in the way a bit. The Scimtar is really great for browsers and for some applications, and has nice clicky,  but wore out pretty quickly and required me to disassemble it to clean with isopropyl alcohol several times.I want a Corsair trackball mouse thing.",
          "Knew what I was getting into with this one. I've been gaming with Corsair products for about 2 years now. Thr only exception being my mouse I finally kicked the Logitech G602 that I've been using for 5+ yrs. The wire is high quality braided like all of their other devices. The software is simple and user friendly. The weights and software customization are incredible I like a heavy mouse and super low DPI for shooters with a high polling rate and this m65 is perfect. Just the right amount of buttons for the type of gaming I do.If you are a WOW or DOTA player you may find this lacking but this mouse is for FPS and other shooters. The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting. If you are on the fence, go for it! That said I love Corsair, I run the K70, Void wireless Pro and now the M65 none of which have ever let me down.",
          "The M65 is just a classic and arguably the best mouse Corsair makes. I used to have a wired M65 like 10 years ago and it was my favorite mouse. I broke it and for some reason tried some other mice by Steelseries and no name brands. I wanted to finally try wireless so I got this mouse. I'll just say this is by far the most premium feeling mouse I've ever used.I really like my mice to be heavy so my movements are more controlled. Wired mice, even with weights just don't cut it. This mouse is heavy (but adjustable), has super nice textures and rubberized surfaces and just looks great. The new opto-mechanical switches have a very nice click to them and I've no left click issues with the mouse. The battery also lasts forever. I never turn it off because it has a sleep mode that conserves battery. It wakes up instantly so you really never need to worry about turning it on and off.",
          "I love the mouse design and feel. Being able to remove the weights on the bottom is nice, but haven't noticed a difference with them in or out. My biggest gripe about this mouse is that the side sniper button is way to easy to click. I'll be moving it around and the accidentally hit the button. I have the original corded version and that one doesn't have this problem. The corded one feels more like a mechanical switch, and the wireless one doesn't seem to have that harder press. Otherwise great mouse.",
          "I had wire one for a years.Wireless one is all i was dreaming on.The quality an feel a bit cheaper than wire one. Plastic and metal, but who care the performance great.I try all other Corsair mouse, some they felt great in hand, but after while I felt pain.This one is best fit and shape for my hand.Highly recommend.I wish they extend the warranty to 3 years.Alaa",
          "This mouse has adjustable weight, but I found the default amount to be perfect. I really like the way it feels and have used it for many hundreds of hours at this point. There is an incessant rattling of what sounds like a cheap piece of plastic when I shake the mouse, however.I don't know if I want to work to get this piece out or if I should just leave it alone as the mouse functions fine.",
          "Solid mouse, does everything a mouse should do. The scroll wheel is malfunctioning however, and given that I use that a lot, it is kind of a bummer.",
          "It's a decent, but smallish mouse in your hand. If you're used to bigger mice this will feel strange. It feels solidly constructed, but it's light enough that I'm careful not to slam it down or anything while gaming. It's okay, in terms of features, but I don't see anything that makes it truly stand out. I could give a mouse like this a 5, but that doesn't seem adequate. It's a standard gaming mouse that can get 3000 dpi, and it works like it should.",
          "1 WEEK UPDATE:  After a week of use I have decided to return this mouse and try the Ironclaw.  The bottom line is, I am not getting used to the feel of this mouse.  I think it is just too small for my hand.  I also don't like the sniper button being located where my thumb naturally rests.  Sometimes I pick up my mouse to re-position it and I end up pushing the sniper button sometimes.  There is no question that this mouse is superb as a dedicated gaming mouse.  Between the 26,000 DPI capability and the 8,000 Hz polling rate, this thing really performs as a gaming mouse.  But for everything else, it falls short for me.  I want a larger mouse that is more oriented towards comfort, I am willing to trade off some of the gaming performance to have a more comfortable mouse.Original Review:For the past 5 years I have been using the Corsair Sabre and just recently noticed issues with the right click, I was having to push it harder for it to stay on during gaming.  Other than that it still works fine so I will keep it as a backup mouse.  But I decided to upgrade to the M65 RGB Ultra.  Last two photos are comparisons of the M65 vs the Sabre.  As you can see the size of the two is equivalent, but the shape and feel is very different.1.  With all the weights installed, the M65 is significantly heavier.  With them removed, significantly lighter.  So it is very nicely tunable in the weight department.  I am keeping all of them installed as I like a heavy mouse.2.  For pretty much everyone the sniper button on the M65 is going to be located where your thumb naturally rests on the mouse.  This is one of the biggest differences that requires getting used to.  The button requires a firm press to activate so accidentally doing so really isn't a concern.  Its just the feel of the button constantly on your thumb is different if you have never used a mouse with a button in this location.  FYI in default setup pressing the sniper button (at any time) changes the mouse to the sniper DPI setting (400 DPI), this is really nice to have during gaming.  I don't play a lot of FPS games but I will still use it occasionally.  Of course you can program all the buttons to do whatever you want them to do in iCue.3.  The mouse wheel on the M65 has a grippier feel and is much harder to rotate.  It also has a very solid click into place.  It isn't a smooth scrolling wheel, it has very pronounced 'notches'.  Some will like it, some won't.4.  I have the wired version and the quality of the USB cable is excellent and very soft.  The USB plug itself has grippy rubber on it and is also very well made.5.  The range of DPI with this mouse is crazy.  I tried 26,000 DPI but frankly I don't see how anyone would ever use it, even in FPS games.  I changed my settings from 1200 DPI to 15,000 DPI and even then I will probably never use the 15k setting.  The most I ever use in game is about 12k.  But it is still available if you want it.6.  One of the draws of the wired version of this mouse is the 8,000 Hz polling rate.  I just tried it while playing the Dead Space remake and did NOT like it at all.  It felt unnatural to me.  It was so fast that I was getting rapid and unexpected movement in game that went away when I lowered the setting to 4,000 Hz.  At 4,000 Hz it is still extremely responsive and feels much more natural to me.  I suspect that I am probably so used to having a slight delay that it just feels more normal.  Note that it also requires a lot of CPU power to function in game at 8,000 Hz.  Its not worth it to me and I didn't like it, but to each his own.Overall I am happy with this mouse.  I still have to get used to the overall feel of it in my hand, but that will happen fairly quickly.  Hopefully it holds up.",
          "There are too many benefits to owning this mouse in particular, but the number 1 feature I love.... the longevity of it\u2019s operational time! I can use this for d a y s without charging it \ud83d\ude43\ud83e\udd70; as a busy nurse who uses this for charting, that is PRICELESS!",
          "I had a much more expensive mouse before buying this one but I always have trouble with the cable going bad where it goes into the mouse body. I am a gamer and my mouse gets a workout. This Corsair is a good mouse but there are a few items I would change if I designed it. The 'sniper' button is not as easy to reach as it should be and I have pretty long fingers (thumb in this case). I do like the metal frame and the overall feel. The resolution settings are a bit too sensitive and even though you have a lot of resolution to choose from (it has 5 settings plus the sniper mode setting) it is almost too much as it makes it hard to dial it in using the sliders that the software uses to set them. I do like the programmable LEDs though that can be set to a variety of color patterns and functions like CPU or GPU temperature so you have an at-a-glance temperature check (although your motherboard has to support this feature).  The software is a bit clunky though, sometimes the menus are not clear as to their function and macro programming can be a bit confusing. Overall and especially for the cost though I give it a big thumbs up. It seems to be a solid mouse with just enough features to be useful.",
          "This is the first mouse I have owned that hasn't been Razer, Love it!. Sad thing is I don't like a Razer keyboard ( there Clicky key sound drives me up wall) LOL. I use a Corsair keyboard and that means I have to install 2 separate apps. Yea i know I'm a crybaby!...lol So I saw this CORSAIR M65 ELITE RGB to go with my keyboard and only need use one app. The mouse feels great! also feels very sturdy, Fits my big hand and basically the same button sett up as my Last mouse (Razor Basilisk) Great mouse! CORSAIR M65 ELITE RGB Has weights, and a meatal frame makes it feel like better quality. To me it feels just right out of the box, Glides a crossed my mouse pad smoothly. My other mouse I tend to become heavy handed wile gaming the feel of CORSAIR M65 ELITE RGB help with this issue. It glides smoothly and able to stay on target, some may understand what I'm trying to say here. So far I am very pleased with it. One thing I think could be better is the app, Not to bad but you have to setup your buttons every time you change games or want to surf the web. You can Rename and save but you have to re click everything to work every time. It would be nice if you could save a profile for each game to just be one click and your ready. My Razer app you save profiles And it would switch automatically. Yep I know, What a spoiled BRAT! LOL... So far so good, I gave it a 4 out of five do to the app issue. Thanks for your time!",
          "This replaced my aging Razer DeathAdder (wired). So far, I've only used it with all the weights installed but having the flexibility to remove weight is nice. Mouse is probably overkill for what I use it for as I'm not an FPS gaming but the thumb button to instantly allow fine adjustments to pointer position is great.",
          "The dps drop button likes to cease. But I like it enough to buy another when that happens so your call.",
          "I've had this mouse for almost two years, and I just purchased a replacement Logitech mouse. The buttons are already dying on this one. The scroll wheel now half the time goes the wrong direction, and the left-click only works about half of the time.I went with Corsair this time because the Logitech mouses that I've had in the past died due to internal wiring problems, but I think they still lasted longer than this Corsair one did.Up until now, the mouse was fine. The low rankings is just because it only lasted two years before needing to be replaced. Very disappointed in Corsair's endurance."

I was not disappointed with the function and performance of this keyboard however, the LEDs are significantly duller than my previously K70.

          "Definitivamente la sensaci\u00f3n es premium, en mi caso se trata del k70 pro speed, la construcci\u00f3n del teclado es muy buena, durara mucho tiempo as\u00ed que lo recomiendo, por otro lado, un punto negativo en comparaci\u00f3n a otros modelos de la serie es que no viene con key caps de remplazo, por lo dem\u00e1s es muy buen teclado.",
          "I only took off 1 star because it's not wireless lol, and I couldn't find this specific keyboard in wireless. Other than that, the clickies are perfect (keyboard nerds will know what the clickies are). I really like that I can change the brightness of the back lighting. I keep semi-long nails and it's still easy to type on.",
          "Let me first start off by saying this keyboard is simply a joy to use. To quickly summarize, it's relatively quiet, beautiful to look at, decent for typing, and functions very well for gaming. If you want a gaming keyboard that looks good, isn't obnoxious noise-wise, and includes robust RGB, this is the keyboard for you. If you need more convincing, let's dive into the details:Build Quality:This is a full fledged premium keyboard. It's got some heft to it with a chassis that is sturdy and thin compared to most gaming keyboards. The RGB lighting is beautiful with each key being able to be individually customized, with customized profiles to boot. The USB cable has two USB heads that connect to the PC (to allow for USB pass-through) and are somewhat thick but not overly so. There is no flex to the keyboard and the key press feel shallow and soft. Overall, it commands the price it demands. The product comes with switchable WASD key's that are grooved with a grey color. The keyboard also comes with an add-on palm rest. However, compared to the keyboard, the palm rest feels like an afterthought as it is plastic, flimsy-feeling, and a fingerprint magnet. However the fact that it is included at all is a nice addition.Performance.:This keyboard works very well as a competitive gaming keyboard and if you're familiar/comfortable with Cherry MX Reds, you will pick up the key travel in no time. However, these definitely have a shallower key travel than standard gaming keyboards and do not have a loud click when pressing them (although they do still make considerable noise). If you use Cherry MX Browns or MX Speed switches the change may be jarring. However, if you are coming from a standard keyboard you will be pleasantly surprised at how familiar they feel and yet allow for fast twitch presses for competitive gaming. Typing on this keyboard is pleasant compared to regular Cherry MX Reds or Brown's as this feels more like a traditional keyboard. Overall this keyboard feels like a perfect in between for gaming and everyday use. The keyboard also allows for different keyboard profiles that can be switched with a dedicated button.RGB/Features:This is a beautiful keyboard to look at. You can get lost just staring at the changing colors. With the iCue software you can create custom lighting profiles with the ability to pick individual key colors. While the keyboard's lighting is great, the iCue software is hit or miss. I could easily deduct a star from this rating due to the buginess and unreliability of the software with respect to the keyboard's lighting, but that would be a disservice to the keyboard itself. So please, ignore ratings that critique the software, as this is separate from the keyboard's RGB functionality in itself. However this works well with all Corsair products if you are invested in their ecosystem. The keyboard does come with a key for changing between three lighting profiles (without having to use the iCue software) and a brightness key. So if you do not want to download the software, you do in fact have the ability to change the lighting profiles, even if somewhat limited. The keyboard also comes with media buttons in the form of a volume slider and a mute/unmute button which are definitely useful. The K70 also has a USB pass through, however, this is not well implemented. The keyboard USB has two separate USB heads that are connected to the keyboard. One is used to power the keyboard and the other is used to power the USB pass-through. So while the USB pass-through is a nice feature, in reality it requires giving up a USB port on your PC to utilize effectively, which completely defeats the purpose of having a pass-through.Price:I purchased this keyboard at $123.98. At this price I would definitely recommend this keyboard. Even at it's normal MSRP price this would be a worthwhile purchase because of it's low profile alone. However, if you are looking for the best gaming performance, I would advise you to look elsewhere as you could find better keyboards at the same price. Overall this is a quality keyboard that is worth money and probably the best low-profile keyboard to date.",
          "I don't have much negative to say about this keyboard, but the negative for me is a show stopper for me. The keys on this keyboard barely need to be pressed in order to register a key stroke.  With my fingers on home row I am constantly inserting J's and F's into words accidentally.  I am not heavy handed. I can rest my finger on a key and just wiggle it and the keystroke will register.  Far too frustrating for me to use.",
          "Okay so let\u2019s see\u2026 a little backstory on why I upgraded. I built my first pc 5 years ago and with it I bought an older version Logitech gaming keyboard. Non mechanical or anything like that. Since then I\u2019ve built 3 new systems but the same keyboard has always stuck around lol. This Christmas I decided to upgrade some peripherals instead of hardware and went with this keyboard since it was on sale for $110.After a day of use I\u2019ve gotta say... I love it. I\u2019ve got all other Corsair peripherals which is why I chose a Corsair keyboard and everything about it is perfect. The keyboard has super bright backlighting. 3 different lighting tiers of brightness. The cherry MX switches in these are amazing too. Overall amazing keyboard that I\u2019m in love with so far. Now here are some points that I wasn\u2019t expecting but I think are important.1. THE KEYS ARE MECHANICAL BUT AREN'T OBNOXIOUS- my little brother has an off brand mechanical keyboard and god damn sometimes it\u2019s so irritating hearing him hit them. This keyboard is nothing like that though. While still having a distinctive click, it\u2019s not obnoxious.2. THE WRIST-REST LOW KEY IS AMAZING-I\u2019ve never had one on a keyboard myself, but a friend had one on his cheaper keyboard and it was flimsy and didn\u2019t seem to help. Not on this keyboard. Holy hell its a game changer, it\u2019s sturdy, texturized, and feels nice to rest my wrist on while gaming. Noticed the comfort right away.3. INCLUDES SPECIAL KEYS FOR BOTH FPS & MOBA GAMES- whether you\u2019re playing League of Legends and using QWER & DF or COD:MW and using WASD, the keyboard included specialized texturized keys to replace the originals with to let you know you\u2019re on the right keys. The outer ones (Q & R) for example even have a slight little incline on the outer edges so you\u2019re aware of where your fingers are without any hesitation. It\u2019s taking me a while to get used to but I already love it.The only thing that I am not a huge fan of so far is the iCue software. I use it for my mouse and Corsair RGB Ram already but never really messed around with it. My main complaint is I spent a few minutes trying to set them all to their own settings, (ram one color & keyboard on rainbow) and it wouldnt let me give them each their own setting. Honestly, I haven\u2019t looked into it much at all so it\u2019s probably simple and I\u2019m just being too lazy to look it up right now but a bit of easier user interface would be nice on the iCue.Anyway I\u2019m sticking with a 5/5 review and would recommend to anyone who wants a nice, quick, sturdy, beautiful, keyboard who doesn\u2019t need macro keys!",
          "I was looking to get an RGB keyboard to replace a very old keyboard. Ive been getting ridiculous with the RGBs, so I figured Id continue with this. I looked at both the black and the white keyboards, and the white keyboard colors look brighter reflecting off the white, and match my Fractal case. Cool! ICUE is just painful, but I was able to get some really great looking profiles for this.PROS-lights up like the Vega strip-Volume and mute keys on the keyboard-Keys to change brightness of keyboard-The palm rest magnetic attachment is good-clickey OPX keyboardCONS-Still a little more clatter from the keys than I want-Keys are *very* sensitive. I accidentally hit keys just resting my hand sometimes. Adapting to it tho-Key tops a little more raised than Im used toIts a RGB keyboard, looks good, works fine, some nice features. If youre into RGB lighting, you'll like this.",
          "I am no professional typist by any means, so take this review with a grain of salt.I can type maybe around 40 words per minute.  I do not type regularly on social media or as a job.I find that the keys are a little bit sensitive.  When I strike a key sometimes I get a space or one or two other characters that were not intended.  So backspace, delete, repeat.  But if you type on a regular basis and know how to strike the keys well then I think you won't have this problem.  So it is probably just me, Mr. Butterfingers.  Other than that issue, I find this is a very charming keyboard.  Love the sound roller bar and mute button together,  the roller bar has a smooth metal machined feel to it.  Well made, solid and beautiful.  Gaming with this board seems fine.  I don't notice any performance enhancements from using it but you may.  Also I find that indeed this keyboard is clicky clack sound that is somewhat noticeable but not annoying.",
          "If you asked me to rate this keyboard based off my personal experience I would rate it 6/10. I've had the keyboard for a couple months now, and personally I've grown to dislike it. All of my reasonings why I do not like/prefer this keyboard are all relative to me, these are my opinions so what I don't like you might love. Take my review with a grain of salt.1: This is probably my biggest complaint. I find that it's hard to type on this keyboard/the keys are small. The backspace key has become my best friend with this keyboard. I find myself making spelling errors and having to correct more often then I've ever had to with any other keyboard. I think the keys are extremely small compared to other keyboards I have owned in the past. Along with the keys being extremely small I also think they are very close together. When typing something out, such as this review I have pressed several keys that I did not intend to which can be frustrating.2: Not a satisfying click and clack to the Cherry Blues specifically on the K70 Pro. I know what you're thinking.. \"first world problems\" but to someone who uses a keyboard all day everyday, you don't want an annoying sounding keyboard and that's exactly what this is. It's loud and more clacky then clicky.3: Color is not very bright. While being able to customize the color on the keyboard is awesome, the color is not very bright. There is a button on the keyboard that allows you to turn the color off completely or dim it a couple notches. However I still find that the brightest setting it can go, is still really dim.4: The wrist rest is uncomfortable. It is slightly bumpy in texture but what I noticed is after I have my wrists on the rest for a long period of time they start to get irritated.Overall, the keyboard is not my favorite and maybe some of my reasonings are dumb, but this is an expensive investment and I want it to live up to my standards. If this doesn't sound like something you'd want, let me recommend the Corsair K70 RGB Mk.2 Cherry Blues. I like that keyboard so much more then the K70 Pro. First of all, it's cheaper. It has bigger keys for an easier typing experience, it has a more satisfying click clack sound, has brighter color and the wrist rest is plastic so it doesn't irritate me as much.Though I won't be using the K70 Pro anymore, I don't want to make this all a negative review. There are good things about this keyboard, it just doesn't fit me personally.",
          "After about 9 or 10 years I switched from my Steelseries keyboard to the Corsair. I love it. The mechanical switches are very reactive and have that satisfying click sound. Very smooth motion with no lag. The back light functions are pretty cool with the different custom set ups. The wrist pad is a good size with the angle of the keyboard. The keys are extremely sensitive, which may be a concern for some, but great for me. Overall, I am very satisfied with this keyboard.",
          "Great keyboard.  Easy to clean with the raised keys.  It came with extra WASD keys that have a texture to them so they are easy to find without looking.",
          "came as expected all down side was half of my keys were off then i had to goand put them back on and then go thour the howle keyboard because all the keys were not pushed all the way on",
          "I truly love this product, I personally think it\u2019s a beautiful design and the PBT-double shot keycaps are a great bonus to the Special Edition. The RGB works perfectly, and the sound adjustment is a nice touch (I\u2019m still trying to figure it out with headset and speaker). Overall 10/10 product! Unfortunately when I bought this keyboard I didn\u2019t get an extended warranty\u2026not like that would\u2019ve have mattered anyways since yesterday I spilled RED wine (and not a lot mind you) all over the center of the keyboard. It\u2019s completely stained in the center underneath the keycaps, and I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s completely ruined. I\u2019m going to try to clean it with isopropyl alcohol and have it dry, I will update if I\u2019m able to clean the undersides of the clear plastic, since that\u2019s where a majority of the wine has subsided.But I wanted to write this review because 1) I love it enough to get a second, and 2) because if you\u2019re a wine person like myself..maybe consider just never drinking it anywhere near your gaming set unless it\u2019s in a closed container, or in the other case go with the black MK.2, but it won\u2019t be the SE with PBT, so less value for price.Lastly I\u2019ll include that I bought this April 2022 for $120, and the price has gone up to $170 or something like that.. sale for $150 at the moment so that\u2019s why I\u2019m considering getting it sooner than later.",
          "I got this keyboard for my girlfriend to give her a keyboard that has a 10key as well as better functionality than her previous keyboard. We game and study in the same room and space and I have to say - whoever said this thing was quiet is a liar. It's clicks are very noticeable and can be almost distracting when trying to study as it's keyboard equivalent of someone eating a bag of chips in your ear. Don't get this if you plan on sharing a space.Other than the loud clicks, another downside is it's design to have 2 USBs in order to use it to it's potential. A little inconvenient in my opinion but hey - I just live here.I'd recommend a Logitech Orion Spark if you don't mind having a black keyboard as I've had mine for almost 10 years with 0 issues.",
          "Upgraded from the red LED Mk. 1 version to the RGB Mk. 2 version after the cable on the first one failed.The RGB lighting is nice, I love the software used to control it. The Cherry Brown switches are a pleasure to use, and the keyboard is very solid. I love having the volume control on the keyboard.The changes from Mk. 1 to Mk. 2 seem to just be the lighted logo on the Mk. 2 and a slightly different volume knob. I think I preferred the Mk. 1 volume, the knob seemed heftier and easier to scroll. It felt nice to use. The Mk. 2 knob isn't bad, just not as nice. I do appreciate the lighted logo.One thing to know about this board is that it is HEAVY. The aircraft aluminum top is hefty. Feels nice, but if you carry it or are used to typing on your lap then it's something to consider. Also the edges are slightly sharp. If you dropped this on your bare foot it's going to HURT, probably break the skin...The cable is a concern. More expensive keyboards will have a removable cable. That would have meant I could continue using the older one when my cable broke. Instead I had to replace it.Another thing about this newer model is it has a loud pinging sound when typing. It's not spring noise. I did get some lube and lube the switches. That didn't help. It's resonance from the bottom plate which is hefty aluminum. There are potential solutions but none of them super easy.",
          "I\u2019ve owned many gaming keyboards over the years, and this is by far the best one I\u2019ve owned! If you\u2019re on the fence, I recommend making the decision to buy it!",
          "Excellent",
          "This keyboard is so much nicer in person, pictures do no justice. Haven\u2019t had any issues mechanically either.",
          "I have used a few different Mechanical Keyboards, and this has been my favorite so far.  I liked it so much, I bought a second one for work.  In this model, I have the Cherry MX Red and the Cherry MX Silent.  The Red is slightly louder than the Silent.  But the travel and feel are the same.As a programmer, I use daily the play/pause button to control music.  The volume knob works nicely on Windows and Mac.  If you are using the volume knob for monitor speakers on a Mac, there is an application you can install to give you better resolution on the volume knob.  But for all other speaker outputs, amps, and headphone outputs, the volume knob works perfect.The brightness of the keyboard is nice and configurable on the keyboard.  The keys are easily removable to replace with other keys.  I use the Silent at work.  The textured keys are nice for gaming.The keyboard does require two USB A ports in your computers.  Every couple of months I need to disconnect both USB cables to reboot the keyboard.  It is not often and it is quick to fix.The next model up includes configurable keys, basically acting like an Elgato Streamdeck on your keyboard.  I felt it was not necessary and stuck with this model.The keyboard armrest is nice.  I use it every day.  It is removable if you do not prefer it.  I use this keyboard daily for work as a programmer and also gaming at night.I like the same of the keyboard.  It is a full-size keyboard with a number pad.  I have tried the smaller keyboards but found them to small and miss the number pad.The RGB colors are configurable.  They can also be turned off.  You can also have the lights on with the computer off if you just want the ambiance.  There are dedicated keys on the keyboard to change the colors.",
          "It looks and feels like the K100 just without the soft plust wrist rest and extra macro keys, so it is not as wide, which I like. Was disappointed about not having the soft wrist rest, that was why I got this new updated one. The one it comes with is rubberized plastic and is still a bit better than the older models which feel just like plastic with no soft rubber.Also I wanted to go back to K70 because the key placement seemed more ergonomic for me, but more specifically the alt key felt more to the right on the older models and since I use a keybind on games like alt+4 or 5 or alt+R, it didnt feel like an awkward stretch, but on the K100 and new K70, the alt key is more left or the keys above it are more right and so my thumb has to go under my palm more which Im not a fan of since I have short fingers, but it's not a deal breaker, especially if you have long(er) fingers.",
          "The K70 is a fantastic keyboard, especially if you are running Windows.  Other reviewers have done a fantastic job on this keyboard as a whole so I'll focus on the Mac aspects of this.  My particular setup was as an external keyboard on a MacBook pro.TL;DR:  Awesome keyboard, but mac / OS X compatibility is still a work in progress.  For the money, I couldn't justify some of the challenges I ran into and ended up returning it.  If I had a windows setup, I would not hesitate for a minute to get this keyboard; however, for a Mac, Keychron and other competitors have done a much better job of managing cross-compatibility.Pros:- Special edition is super slick; the brushed aluminum look was beautiful.  Solid build all around. The LEDs looked fantastic off that.- PBT keys are awesome; and the Cherry MX Speed switches were great to type on.- The volume wheel is super cool and helpful!  You get used to having it very quickly.- The feel for a touch typist is really nice.  One of the best keyboards I've ever owned from that vantage point.- iCue software is available for the Mac, and you can do some pretty cool stuff with it (or download profiles of people who have!)- USB Passthrough was convenient, and I kinda like the fact that it was wired - no batteries to think about.- Feet in the back allow for nice angle when typing.- Corsair has a super active user community.  The forums were super helpful.  They almost had enough solutions to the problems that I almost kept the keyboard ... but in the end, it felt like too much of a hack ... and I really wanted something that was better designed for mac use.Cons:- You have to place the keyboard into BIOS mode in order to be able to use it when the mac reboots.  It's not terrible, but it is a limitation that I wish wasn't there (F1 and the windows lock key for 5 seconds if I recall correctly).- iCue software has limitations; you can't really map the Fn key to anything - it doesn't register as a key anywhere or as a modifier so you can't really get any of the special keys set up to use on a mac.  The latter section of the function keys did have some mapping but they weren't the standard mac ones.- iCue software would freeze at times so the animations/profiles (outside of some static / hardware ones that are available) would not run.- Home and End buttons don't work the way you think they might; there is a keybindings hack you can do to get it to work ... YMMV- You can map keys to other keys, etc. so you can shift things around using profiles; but, those keys have to be available in the first place in order for you to map them.- The media buttons seemed out of place compared to the PBT keys ... that's just a preference thing- For my setup, while it was almost compact enough for a full layout, it was still a bit wide not leaving enough room for the mouse.  so if you have a tray or something like that, be sure to consider that in your selection- Animations would sometimes freeze, requiring a reboot.  And that would bring me full circle to the BIOS mode issue.- Upgrades took forever, and almost made it seem like the computer wasn't coming back ... I read this to mean iCue is still a little buggy.- No Mac keys for you to swap out so it feels more at home.- The font on the keys, and the abbreviations are not standard.  they let more light in, but they do take some getting used to (some keys look very crowded, etc.)In the end, I couldn't justify all the \"hacks\" and was concerned about upgrades and such.",
          "Disclaimer: Ive used the Steel Series 6Gv2 (Cherry MX Black), as well as the Razer Black widow (Cherry MX Brown).For purposes of this review i am focusing on the performance, feel and build quality. (Spoiler: ITS FANTASTIC)Of all the keyboards i have used and typed on, this is by far the greatest thing my fingers have ever had the pleasure of experiencing besides *censored for family-friendly purposes*.Let me just say that if you enjoy linear switches, but are nervous about the sensitivity of the Cherry-Silver switches found on this board then fear not, for that was also my fear. The problem i had with cherry black was that sometimes i would press a key quickly just to find that i did not press hard enough and i would actually miss key presses that way. I got the black widow for the brown switches thinking that the tactile bump would help me know when the key was actuated. While it helped i could not help but feel that the tactile bump somehow slowed me down or got in the way of that smooth gliding typing feel.ENTER THE MX CHERRY SILVER.While i have never tried reds, i have heard that they are some of the most preferred switches for gaming. Having tried these silver switches i can now see why. (Reds are similar to silver switches, but with a deeper actuation point of 2.0mm compared to the Silver's 1.2mm actuation travel. The Reds total travel distance is also deeper at 4.0mm, Silver's total key travel is 3.4mm deep) When i go for a key, there is no worry about the key not actuating for the key effortlessly gives into the force of my finger. The switches are not so sensitive where the weight of my finger alone actuates them. It is just PERFECT. It truly is a hard thing to describe. For gaming i cannot imagine a better switch or board. And typists fear not for if you are sure footed in your typing skills then know that the linear switch is not your enemy when it comes to the Silver MX switches. I actually look forward to using this Keyboard every day. That is literally how much i enjoy this board. This is the first review i've wrote on amazon in years. That is literally how much i enjoy typing on this board. I almost dont want to even stop typing now lol. The funny thing is i was going to get the k70 with cherry mx browns, but decided on the LIMITED EDITION WHITE VERSION because it includes the DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS. which was a big deal for me. I wanted the most durable keyboard i could get and i saw how on the regular k70 some people complained about breaking keycaps. (YOU CAN BUY THE DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS SEPARATELY FOR $50). I thought it was well worth the risk with Amazons generous return policy to try this one out. PLUS THAT WHITE KEYBOARD IS SEXY LOOKING AF.I typed this whole review out on the board and only made 1-2 typos.rgb lighting is self explanatory. its gorgeous. everything about this board is gorgeous.BOTTOM LINE OR TLDR:Avid typist or Gamer you will not regret splurging on this board. It is the best purchase i have ever made for a PC peripheral and it works well on MAC as well. The included wrist rest is also really nice. though it is rigid is has a soft touch texture and has eliminated elbow and wrist discomfort that i would normally get on my glass desk surface.ps. DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVE THE VOLUME WHEEL? EVEN WORKS ON THE MAC!Edit(11/3/2021) This keyboard is still rocking without a single issue yet! I hope they continue producing it. It seems the newer designs are straying away from what worked so well on this edition. Many of these companies are attempting to produce their own gamer switches rather than rely on MX Cherry. MX Cherry has the best reputation for switch quality though for obvious reasons so keep that in mind when researching your next keyboard.",
          "Fantastic. The response time on the keys is blistering swift and the sound each keypress makes is wonderful. It really encourages me to keep writing to maintain that cadence. The Light options are little more fun and refined and this keyboard does away from the macro keys on the left side that I literally never use but always push accidentally. The volume roller is incredibly smooth and kind of neat. Excellent keyboard, simply put.",
          "Replacing a older K70 keyboard that got broken during a move.I just love my K70 keyboard a very satisfying key-press, fantastic RGB and the ICUE program.I also use their M65 PRO RGB mouse, love it too.The ICUE configuration utility makes getting driver updates and making RGB profiles super easy.Loved and recommended.",
          "Still working great years later!",
          "I was looking to replace my K70 Mk2, amazon stated it wasn't available anymore and this model was the replacement. I was in a rush and didn't do my research, it's missing features that the previous model had.Pass-through port: The old model has a passthrough USB port which I guess most people use for their mouse, I have a different port so it wouldn't be an issue but my SB Katana has a short USB cable and the old passthrough port was perfect for this. If you don't need a USB port here this may be perfectly good.Key replacements: The older model came with key replacements for popular gaming keys like WASD, that were textured and elevated, much easier to navigate without looking, so I'll be adjusting to these not having that.Loudness: These keys are noticeably louder than my previous board, probably not gonna bother me honestly I always game with headphones but my mic might pic this up, it's a consideration for some people, namely streamers.The \"cut out\" for just a few keys doesn't seem complete, but so far it seems to illuminate enough that it's not hindering the legibility of the keys.Lastly: I haven't had time to troubleshoot this yet but out of the box the software is not detecting the keyboard and I can't change the default lighting yet. I'll have time at some point today to work on that.If none of the issues I mentioned are probably for you and you're getting a decent price it's a great board, I've been exclusive to corsair boards since my first one, I love them, but this one did disappoint a bit, especially being a \"pro\" series.",
          "My old one was struggling when I spilled some water and it splashed on it..well rather a lot did actually.  The first time my son spilled a soda on it while gaming, then other son spilled a beer on it.  (don't drink and game when using mom's keyboard).  After ordering this new one the old one starting working again.  (Immediately after a spill turn keyboard over and  then leave in a or container sitting on uncooked rice like you do a wet phone.  I layer rice, cheesecloth then upside down keyboard.  after couple days, use your key puller and clean around them with a q-tip with a little cleaner to remove beverage residue.  Good luck! Loving the new one as it does have improvements, one cable end to plug in instead of 2, wrist rest is more comfortable than the old one for me.",
          "If you go on r/MechanicalKeyboards you'll see corsair keyboards getting a lot of flack for being overpriced for for their quality but honestly I don't really see it, I think the quality is good enough, it's no tank but for something that will just sit on your desk the whole time it really doesn't need to be. The mk.2 seems to be sturdy enough, the top is a fairly thick piece of aluminum, about as thick as I would expect a keyboard faceplate to be at least, and the whole thing is fairly ridged overall. The bottom of made of plastic and I see people complain that it's too thin but if you're not using your keyboard to bludgeon your enemies then it should hold up just finr. My biggest gripe with this keyboard are the keycaps, they're light, thin and laser ablated so they're likely to wear over time. Corsair offers a doubleshot version of these same keycaps, but they're another $50 so if you're set on getting those then this starts to become a nearly $200 keyboard. That being said, I think that if quality had to be sacrificed somewhere to meet this price point then the keycaps are the most logical option as they're the only part of the keyboard you can easily modify yourself if you want and I really don't see them as a huge problem until they actually start to wear. This keyboard comes with another set of WASD and QERF keys with a textured surface that won't wear so if you mostly use those it's probably not a huge issue. I suppose only time will tell how bad these keys wear.I was looking for several things in a keyboard, I wanted an aluminum top plate, a minimal, clean look, RGB and I wanted it to be mechanical and this keyboard meets all those things.I really like the brushed aluminum, it doesn't take on finger prints, it looks really good and it adds some good heft so full points there. The switches protrude out of the faceplate so there is nowhere for dirt and dust to fall in to and get trapped, this makes it really easy to clean with one of those compressed air cans so if you like to keep things clean then that is a huge plus. This is a really good looking keyboard, it doesn't overdo it by trying to look all gamery and wouldn't look out of place in an office or anything (with the RGB off at least), though you can see the pictures for yourself so whether you like how it looks is really up to you.The RGB is fully customizable on a per key basis but if you want all the fancy effects then you always need to have the corsair iCUE software running in the background which I'm not a huge fan of. You can save three RGB profiles onto the keyboards internal memory but the effects are a bit more limited if you chose to rely only on that. You can still set each key to any color you want and you can use some effects, but the effects can't be as elaborate as if you have the software running in the background. This isn't a huge problem for me because I don't really want much more than static back lighting anyway but its something you should be aware of. I guess each key can be readdressed to do whatever you want and you can make macros, but this particular model doesn't have any dedicated macro keys. These aren't really features that I've needed to use and so I don't particularly care about them.I got the version with the cherry mx brown switches because up to now I've been using a keyboard with blue clones and I wanted to try something different. I miss the clickyness of the blues but I like the feel of the browns well enough, I only wish that they were more tactile because the tactile bump isn't super prominent and isn't very sharp.  The browns are a lot less noisy that blues but they're still nowhere near silent. Most of the sound just comes from the keys bottoming out so it could be made just a little more silent with some o-rings but I don't like the feel of the o-rings as much. I considered returning this key board and getting the version with the blue switches for a little while but I've grown to like the brown switches, but it's all subjective. A lot of hard core mech keyboard enthusiasts don't really like browns but I don't have much experience with other switches so I can't say too much about that.The dedicated media controls are nice to have I suppose, but I only ever find myself using the volume knob. The wrist rest is just solid plastic but it has a soft texture and is definitely a plus, I haven't used one up to now but I don't think I could go without one in the future as it makes typing so much more comfortable. The USB passthrough is a nice feature, I use it for my wireless mouse dongle so that it's closer and the connection is more reliable but I imagine that it would be really convenient for a wired mouse as well, there are some routing channels on the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to keep things tidy if you do use a wired mouse . I don't think the passthrough wouldn't be ideal for something that you would remove and insert frequently because it's on the back of the keyboard which makes it awkward to get to in my opinion. The USB cable is braided and really thick which gives it a pretty premium feel. It's also super long so you shouldn't have much trouble getting it to where you need it to go. It's pretty ridged so if you move the keyboard around a lot on your desk that might be a bit of a problem.This keyboard really needs to be packaged better, Amazon just ships it in the box that the keyboard comes in and there isn't any foam or anything in that box so the only thing between the top of the keyboard and the boxes that will inevitably be dropped or stacked on top of it during shipping is a piece of cardboard. Because of this, my keyboard came with some of the keys knocked out both times, I replaced my first one because I thought it came broken. The first one's volume wheel was really loose compared to the second one I received, I don't know if that was a manufacturing defect or from rough treatment during shipping but it would be nice if Amazon just shipped it in another box with some proper packing material.",
          "bought this as a gift for my friend and he absolutely loves it",
          "Not entirely new box packaging but still impressed with the overall quality and care to keep it safe.",
          "first of all, I really do love this keyboard. I'm even using it right now. the thing I don't like is it really is quite a bit louder than I am used to. it's not a deal breaker for me but, I will most likely invest in some kind of key noise damper for it. another thing I don't like (this is purely my own fault) I didn't pay enough attention to the listing and... there are no \"G\"-keys. sigh. I really wish I still had them. I like this keyboard enough that I can do without them. Corsair's  key mapping feature in iCue is still there and I can remap any key but, using a control/alt/shift modifier isn't available so you can only map individual keys. if you can, I haven't figured it out yet. overall it's worth the price. this is my first mechanical keyboard. the switches are lighter than I am used to but again, not problematic for me. lots to love here and only minor preference annoyances. the integration of the lighting effects into the scheme in iCue is pretty neat to see. some of the lighting link effects make much more sense after getting this keyboard. oh yeah, one last thing... the cord is a neat braided piece (and significantly longer than I'm used to seeing) but it is thicker, less flexible and is a little tougher to manage into place. the passthrough USB on the back is quite handy. I realize it's mostly there for the addon Nexus module (that I don't have) so I use it for a fingerprint reader to make easier access. also, I don't have to have that fingerprint reader in a visible location on my PC or monitor base. this keyboard also feels much heavier and stiffer than the previous all plastic keyboards I've had. it really adds to the premium feel of this keyboard.",
          "Been using the Corsair K70 for about a month now and here are my thoughts:1.  The quality of the keyboard is absolutely top notch.  The solid metal construction, the wrist rest, the packaging, the RGB lighting.  All amazing.  I could easily see this keyboard lasting me the rest of my life.2.  I am not an expert on mechanical keys and frankly it had been so long since I had used one I didn't really even care. I almost saved the money and just bought Corsair's regular keyboard (non mechanical).  However, after a month of using this I am glad I didn't.  It actually took me some time to get used to the mechanical switches but now that I am, I love them.  They make everything more enjoyable (typing and gaming) and certainly allow me to type faster.  There is no doubt about it, they are superior.3.  The roller in the upper right hand corner of this keyboard is main volume control, as you probably guessed.  Let me tell you:  its freakin awesome, just brilliant.  I use it constantly.  I don't think I can ever go back to having volume keys/ buttons.4.  This keyboard includes two additional sets of \"gaming\" keys.  Basically the A,S,D,Q,W and E keys but they are shaped differently and have a different texture so you can locate them more easily during gaming.  I am not using them but it is a nice touch by Corsair.  Someday I might throw them on just to try them.5.  Now the RGB: I have to say it is growing on me.  I did not buy this for the RGB and even now I still have it set on just a solid red glow, which is what its been on since I got it.  But I have also played Far Cry 5 and now the new Far Cry (New Dawn) with it and the native support in those two games is pretty awesome.  Particularly New Dawn.  The profile for that game is very nice and actually does add a level of interaction that you wouldn't expect.  I have only played New Dawn for a total of about an hour so far and have already seen this keyboard do a bunch of cool stuff in game.  For example, when you beat a mission, you get something like fireworks on the keyboard.  When it is night in the game, the keyboard RGB is more subdued.  The list goes on, the RBG lighting changes depending on what is happening in game and it really is cool, even to me.  I also have a Corsair Pro series water cooler and gaming mouse but the RBG lighting on those just isn't nearly as intricate as this keyboard.  I am now considering downloading some more profiles , or perhaps making one myself.Don't hesitate to buy this keyboard, you won't be disappointed with any aspect of it.  And certainly if you are an RGB fan, you are sure to love it.",
          "I ordered the Corsair RGB RAPIDFIRE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard recently because I decided that it was an opportune time to upgrade from my previous keyboard.  I type a lot of papers and have played various types of games that demand different abilities from my keyboard.  I determined that the Corsair Gaming Keyboard meets my needs the best compared to other available keyboards.  Because of its value, features, and quality, this is one of the best keyboards on the market. The keyboard\u2019s price is one of the most competitive on the market.  For example, the competing APEX PRO keyboard is on sale for $199.99 on Amazon.  The Corsair keyboard was originally $169.99 but was on sale for $139.99.  The two keyboards have similar features; each keyboard has a mechanical feel, they each have similar response times, and they are each RGB and programmable.  The only difference is that the Corsair keyboard is $60.00 dollars less expensive.  There were also some less expensive keyboards.  For example, the Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard was $27.99, but was lacking in response time, feel, and durability.  I was looking for an affordable keyboard that still had all of the high-quality features that I wanted, and I found that in the Corsair keyboard. In addition to its value price, the Corsair keyboard had many great features that sold me on it.  As mentioned in the name, the keyboard is RGB.  RGB means that the keyboard can light up in many different colors using the primary colors of red, green, and blue.  The keyboard comes with pre-programmed light patterns, but you can also program your own light patterns.  For example, certain keys can be programmed with different colors for gaming purposes.  The keys can also be programmed to light up in sequential or timed order and in almost any color.  I even managed to program the keys so that is looked like an American flag waving in the wind.  You can adjust the lights on the keyboard by using the simple CORSAIR ICUE software.  The keyboard also has a great mechanical feel without sacrificing any key response time.  In addition, the keyboard has textured keys for the W, S, A, and D, as well as for the arrow keys to give them a comfortable gaming feel.  A wrist or arm wrist precedes the keyboard to provide a correct, relaxed hand and finger level.  There is also a volume roll bar adjuster, programmable short cut keys, and a number pad for use like a calculator. The quality of the keyboard was also another selling point.  The keyboard frame is constructed from aircraft-grade, anodized, brushed aluminum, which is built to withstand a lifetime of heavy use.  The keys themselves are constructed from high-quality plastic which allows them to withstand millions of keystrokes. There are also five different key options that vary in click feel, so there is a perfect keyboard for even the pickiest gamers.  If you are worried about the durability of this keyboard, you can set that aside. Because of its value, features, and quality, this is one of the best keyboards on the market.  I had few concerns regarding the packaging and shipping of the keyboard, but it arrived two days after I had placed my order and without any damage.  I ordered this keyboard as an upgrade to my old one, and it exceeded my expectations.",
          "I'm not a gamer, so that functionality metric doesn't come into play here.I was looking for a backlit keyboard with keys that provided a bit of a tactile and auditory feedback.I believe some online reviews classify these as quiet, but I wouldn't say that's the case. There is an audible click (which I like) when I actuate the keys, but that's in part because of the way I type. If you merely brush a key, it will register and you won't hear a noise.That's sometimes a minus since I'm not a touch typist and will occasionally brush keys adjacent to the keys I mean to hi (meaning, it registers the extra stroke).Apparently, you can adjust the sensitivity of the keys' response, but it's fine as it came.You can set various lighting patterns and even assign specific colors to specific keys or groups of keys . . . none of which I do. Solid white for me since, as I said, I'm not a gamer.There are a bunch of different dynamic patterns one can set that can light the keyboard like a spastic Xmas tree . . . again, none of which I use.the iCUE software it comes with is relatively easy to use, but it lacks one important thing (for me).I would prefer if the keyboard lighting switched off (went into a sleep mode) when the computer monitor goes to sleep, however, this model doesn't come with a sleep mode.Considering it's a feature that's present in cheaper backlit monitors, and considering that it's a software feature, I think it's fairly chinchy of the manufacturer not to include it.You can manually turn off the backlighting, but it would be nice if it had a sleep mode.Other than that minor annoyance, I've been using the keyboard for a few months now and I'm very happy with it.",
          "nice keyboard but the keys are a bit to loud had to add some o rings to lower the sound, and the wrist rest has a weird texture on it that after a long game session leave imprints in my hand. ended up just leaving it off.",
          "Son is a gamer and he says this is he best keyboard",
          "This keyboard is exactly what I needed for gaming, and I love the extra gaming keys that is included, the USB pass-through is a very nice feature for short corded mice. Keys could be a bit quieter but that's my opinion, the RGB is very nice aswell and you can choose to have specific keys a certain color or which keys light up. We'll worth the $ couldn't be happier.",
          "So this is my first venture into mechanical keyboards- I've exclusively used membrane keyboards in the past, with my last being a Logitech G110 that served me well for a long, long time. Unfortunately due to a spill I killed the spacebar from working reliably on my Logitech, so I decided in looking for a new keyboard that would serve me well in gaming and general typing, so I looked into going with a mechanical. Here's my review after spending wayyyyy too many hours researching the pros/cons of going with a mechanical vs a traditional membrane keyboard-Build Quality - 10/10You paid for a $140 keyboard, and you're certainly getting one. It's very solid, and the keys themselves scream quality. The stainless steel backplate just reinforces the care they put into this thing, even though you'll rarely look at, not to menti9on touch, that piece of the board. There's no side-to-side wobble to worry about- you have to actually grip a key with a couple fingers to be able to wiggle one around.  Zero complaints here!Ergonomics - 9.5/10The low profile form factor sits nice and comfortably comparing to traditional keyboards. Really, there's no complaint here. I could probably type for hours on this without issue. Wrist position is pretty much as close to flat as you can get, with a very comfortable an not carpel tunnel inducing angle, which was one of my concerns about traditional mechanical keyboard that tend to sit very high to the keys. My only complaint which garnered the .5 minus was while the wrist rest feels very comfortable, it is kind of slick despite its textured surface, which makes me FEEL like my hands are sliding downwards, even thought they're really not.Gaming - 10/10The keys are extremely responsive. The key clicks are very precise and feel great. They include optional raised and textured WASD keys, which are angled inwards to give you a good resting space for movement. These are more traditional mechanical keyboard height so it makes it easy to locate them by feel, so if you take your hand off of the keyboard for a second, it's super easy to get back in position. They also have another set of QWERSDF keys, which I'm not 100% sure what that combination would be for. They do include a key extractor tool to pop off the keys to switch them out, which is nice.My only possible complaint would be accuracy, which I'll cover below.Typing - 9/10Overall this is a pretty good experience. My only complaint may only be from adjusting from a membrance keyboard- the quick switches feel just a little too sensitive. Since the switch weight distance is so low, I find myself resting my fingers on the keyboard and that alone being enough weight to trigger the keys. Great for gaming when you're tensed up and ready to go, but for general typing I've been plagued with lots of repeated letters as I rested my hands while gathering my next thoughts, or mistyped letters as I accidentally barely brush adjacent keys while I'm typing words. But overall, not too bad and I'm getting used to it.Functionality - 9/10Overall this satisfied my biggest concern in buying a keyboard - media controls. In particular, the volume wheel, as transitioning between a quiet game to a YouTube video, or even between YouTube videos with different audio levels, makes me want something I can physically adjust on the fly without clicking through software-based volume adjustment. Really I only took off one point because of the lack of Macro keys. My Logitech G110 had those aplenty, however the K70 low profile lacks any. I never used them at all to be honest, but I'm sure there are those who would've like to see them on a premium low-profile keyboard. Guess we'll have to wait until Corsair does one of these in the K90 model.Also there's a USB passthrough on the top \"back\" of the keyboard by the cable. I haven't used it, but be aware this DOES require you to have a 2nd USB port on your computer to plug in a cable for that.Sound - 8.5/10Look, it's a mechanical keyboard. It's definitely louder than membrane keyboards I'm thinking of when I'm coming up with a comparison, which is why I'm docking a full 1.5 points. Really for mechanical keyboards that I've heard, this should be close to a perfect 10/10, but not compared to regular old membrane typing keyboards. Great for home, not perfect if you have it in an office close to a desk-mate.The important thing is that it doesn't put out an ungodly racket, like those folks you hear in game that have an open mic and sound like they're using a hammer on their keyboard for key inputs. So overall, extremely quiet for a mechanical but folks near you will definitely hear you tap tapping away as you compose that email.Aesthetics- 9/10I left this for last, since I don't really care all that much about RGB or look on my gaming keyboard that I will rarely be laying eyes on while concentrating on the game at hand. But I have to admit, it's not a bad looking piece of equipment. The brushed stainless steel backboard reflects the LED RGB really well, making it look pretty attractive. Plus using iCue to link the colors with my M65 Elite mouse is a really nice touch. There are some cool effects you can do with lighting, but I tend to like a slow scroll between colors the best. Why the -1 star? The font they use on the keycaps isn't great. I guess it's less \"mature\" than I'd like. Small complaint, but personally it bugs me just a teeny bit.Conclusion-Overall this keyboard is fantastic, and you REALLY feel like you get what you pay for. If you're more concerned about the feel of the board instead of having macro keys that you may not use, this is the board for you. Very happy with the purchase, and considering the quality of the build and the reputation of the switches I'm resting easy on paying to use this keyboard for several years to come.",
          "I'm going to start by telling you that I'm not a gamer, but I prefer gaming PC hardware because it tends to be more customizable, have more options available/larger selection, and lasts a lot longer.  I am a developer and work in the IT department of a large organization, spending over 50 hours per week at my computer typing code, documentation, emails, etc., so my machine is important to me.I needed a new keyboard and just wanted RGB so I went on a hunt and asked some gamer friends for recommendations  on what to look for.  Based on my \"likes\" for keyboard feel, they recommended the Cherry Red switches (in addition to a few others). I was able to test some at a local PC store and decided that the Cherry MX Red from Corsair was by far my favorite. Then off to Amazon for the right options/layout and price.  I prefer a keyboard with a bit more angle and a deeper key.  As non-gamer, I didn't need the customizable hot keys, but I absolutely insist on a separate number pad for when I'm doing calculations. that led me to this layout (non mini, non low profile, no gamer keys off to the left).This keyboard feels great.  I actually find that I make fewer typos when using it than on my prior keyboard. It's amazing with the right amount of give and take in a key will do for you.I will say that the keys are a little more sensitive than I'm used to so I occasionally get a double hit on a key or if I'm resting my left hand while I type some right hand letters, a left hand key might slip in the mix.  I'll get used to it over time but it is something to note.  The included wrist rest is a must to get the right angle on the keys, and I wish the back prop supports were a bit longer, but I'll make it work.The RGB lighting effects are amazing, even without the proprietary software. It worked plug and play out of the box, but the description is wrong - it says you only need USB 2.0. You need at least one 3.0 port for the keyboard itself, but the passthrough USB can be 3.0 or 2.0.I love that it came with a few replacement/alternate keys for the main gaming keys (wasd and fderqw) that are textured plus a key remover. You won't need the key remover, though - I had 4 keys that had popped off in transit and I had to replace them. No damage but I had to pop them back on.The volume control wheel is more helpful than I would  have thought, and it's even intelligent enough to adjust the volume on the remote machine when connected and using an RDP session but adjust the local machine settings if you minimize the RDP session and return to your local workstation.I've only used this for about half a workday so far and already I'm in love.  I would absolutely buy this keyboard again and am considering getting a full set of replacement keys for when I eventually wear the paint off these (as I tend to do, no idea how!)Long story long, this is a great RGB keyboard with a smooth keystroke and just enough click to let you know it's mechanical.  Corsair got this one right.",
          "This is a great keyboard. After struggling with a Logitech keyboard for years, I decided it was time for a change as Logitech simply did not product a wired keyboard with the specifications I was looking for. One thing I want to warn anyone who connects these with the iCue software, be advised that you must use a USB 3.0 or 2.0. You CANNOT use a Super Speed USB port. It will not work. It will show the devices as malfunctioning in the software if connecting through a hub or directly to the motherboard SS port. Other than this minor correctible quibble, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.",
          "I only used it for about 5 minutes, I think the typing experience is much better on my HyperX Alloy Elite 2, so much smoother.  I was kind of looking forward to the Blue Clicky Tactile feeling, but it really wasn't there for me and not what I expected.  I wish the HyperX Alloy Elite 2 had the Blue Clicky keys for an option, but they only have the Linear Red as an option.",
          "I love this keyboard it's so pretty and I love the silver keys, sounds amazing.",
          "fairly decent keyboard, i was surprised by the metal features and the shear weight of the keyboard.But the software from Corsair left something to be desired.I couldn't change the RBG or any settings for the keyboard.Other then the mechanical keys, it might as well have been a regular keyboard.",
          "Very solid keyboard, RGB backlighting is great with a ton of personalization options. Being a mechanical keyboard, the key sounds aren't too bad compared to others I've used. Can definitely tell it's made with quality materials.",
          "I love the k70 so much that this is my 3rd version (I miss the original logo on the top of the keyboard and prefer the red WASD keycaps over grey).I had my last k70 for about 5 years and the left shift key completely stopped working for no apparent reason. I did a complete teardown since it was out of warranty but I think 5 years worth of gaming which uses the left shift key a lot just wore it down.Now I am on my 3rd Corsair brown switch k70 and while the logo and keycaps are a little disappointing, it is still one of the best mechanical keyboards I've used. The brown switches on this newest version feel even softer and smoother than those on my old k70, which is a nice surprise!The wrist-rest has also been improved over prior versions and is very stable now. The old wrist-rest was very easy to accidentally break the connectors with even normal usage. It still uses basically the same type of connection to the keyboard, but the wrist-rest itself is very solid and has many more contact points for your keyboard.It has a single USB pass-through on the back of the keyboard. It would have been nice to have two, as one slot is just enough to add a wired gaming mouse but thats it. Its a nice feature to have even if it is just one.The downsides:This keyboard is inherently delicate. There are many open areas where if you have even a very minor spill will drain right onto the PCB, so I highly recommend a protective cover. This also prevents things like hair, dust, debris, etc. from building up inside. Its worth it to spend an extra 10-15 bucks to protect it!They changed profile switching from a manual sliding switch in the back to a button on the top. I dont switch between profiles almost ever so its not a big deal, but if you do, know that this has been changed and that its a single button that you need to press for each profile switch.They have changed around some of the buttons on the top of the keyboard that control stuff like brightness or windows key lock from the old versions as well, so my muscle memory always looks in the wrong place. Its probably better placement but it feels strange for me.All said, this is a great mechanical keyboard for gaming and general use as well. The RGB can be quite beautiful, even if I only use it in solid blue color. As long as you protect and care for it, it will give you years of flawless use!",
          "The keyboard is bright and I love the mechanical keys. My only criticism is the enter key on the number pad arrived defective. I\u2019m willing to overlook it, but just a bummer since it\u2019s brand new.",
          "Heavy feel to it and does not feel cheap at all my only complaint is the keys are a little noisy for my liking",
          "I bought this about a year ago. About 8 months in, for some reason the red color just completely stopped working. I worked with tech support to do things like reset the keyboard and update the firmware, but nothing worked. Eventually they decided to replace my keyboard, as it was still under warranty (which is for 2 years). It\u2019s unfortunate, but I\u2019m glad they\u2019re replacing it.Two other problems:1) sometimes the volume roller stops working and the volume either gets stuck entirely down (ie mute) or jacked all the way up.2) Sometimes the keyboard itself just stops working entirely, as if it\u2019s unplugged when it\u2019s not.For both problems, you have to unplug and then plug it back in. It doesn\u2019t happen too often, but it\u2019s annoying when it does.Other thoughts:- I got the version with the Cherry MX Brown switches. I can\u2019t compare it to other switches or mechanical keyboards, as this is my first, but I will say that compared to standard, cheap membrane keyboards, it is much more satisfying to type on- The metal they use for the board is very sturdy and high quality, which I appreciate. However, when typing on it there is a noticeable \u201cding\u201d noise. I think Linus Tech Tips pointed this out, too. I\u2019ve gotten used to it and don\u2019t mind, but some people might- The Corsair iCUE software needs major improvement. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I think it has at least something to do with why my keyboard lost its red color functionality- I\u2019ve noticed the price went up about $30 from when I purchased this last year. It was discounted then, but now it\u2019s full MSRP. Is it worth it? With the warranty and Corsair replacing mine with a working one, I\u2019d say yes. But hopefully the replacement lasts longer.- I\u2019m not really sure if this enhances my \u201cgaming\u201d performance all that much lol. Note that this one doesn\u2019t have separate gaming macro-keys like the more expensive closely. That said, it\u2019s very accurate and responsive, and I don\u2019t have to deal with the mushy membrane keyboard responsiveness anymore.- The volume roller really is useful (when it works, which thankfully is most of the time). Not having to Alt-Tab out of a game or application to adjust the volume is a great ability. Granted, you can get buttons that do that on keyboards that cost much less, but just saying, I like the feature.In general, it\u2019s definitely the highest quality keyboard I\u2019ve ever purchased, but also easily the most expensive, so it should be. Are there other keyboards out there for $160 that are better? Maybe. But I really like this one",
          "I'm a hardcore gamer and software developer. I put a ton of mileage on my computer hardware, using it all for both work and play. I play on both Windows 10 and Linux Manjaro. For the past few years, I had the Corsair Strafe RGB with the silent mechanical keys. I absolutely loved that keyboard. Sadly, the W and E keys started ghosting, so I went on the hunt for a replacement. I've owned every major keyboard in the gaming market in the last 10~ years. Corsair obviously, but also Logitech, a Razer Blackwidow,  Saitek Eclipse III.  I just think Corsair is ahead of the game and more innovative in the keyboard department, so I looked for another Corsair. I also wanted something compatible with my existing color profiles on both Windows and Linux. I ran across this one on Amazon. The limited edition is quite like none I seen before, and I just had to have it.I ordered, and I love this thing so far. The pluses; I absolutely love the brushed aluminum body of this keyboard. I'm just absolutely crazy for it! I've just never seen anything like it, and it's such a modern step away from the atypical boring plastic, black keyboards. It almost makes the rest of my computer hardware look extremely dated. The backlit keys reflect off of the brushed aluminum as well, instantly noticeable and awesome vs. my old Strafe. The keyboards got some weight to it, which is great. It doesn't move or wobble around at all. Again compared to my old Strafe RGB, I also think the LED's a bit brighter on this one, they just stand out and look nicer. I love the media buttons. There's also a button to quickly switch color profiles on the whim.Performance wide, it is a phenomenal keyboard. You really don't have to type hard on this thing at all, the keys hold up firmly. The keys are extremely responsive and sensitive (which I like). It's great for both gaming and writing code. The keys hold up well resting your fingers on them as well. I've messed up code before doing that! Some other pluses. I love the braided USB cable, as well as the font and styling of the letters and special characters on the keyboard. It's all nice and sleek, while still being highly readable.Cons; not many, but I have to mention them. This keyboard is definitely on the noisy side. To be blunt, it's loud! It doesn't bother me as the user, but if I heard someone within earshot of it, I'd probably get really tired of hearing it after a while. I really wish Corsair would find ways to implement the silent mechanical keys on all models. That to me, was extremely innovative on the Strafe RGB. I've heard of some people actually liking the noise. I'm someone who writes code 8 hours a day and then games on this thing. The noise can bit a bit much, at least for work. It also makes the keyboard, to me, feel a bit too old school (more below).Next thing, ergonomics. It's a fine and comfortable keyboard for the most part, but I wish they would have done a little more in this department. The keyboard only tilts backwards. I wish these keyboards had adjustable legs in all corners. To prevent carpel tunnel and strain, it's better to have opposite of a keyboard that tips forward in stead.  The wrist pad is also nothing special, probably the weakest part of the keyboard in an otherwise perfect design.Back to the old school comment. I've been playing computers for, heck, 25 years now, since I was a kid. The keyboard, it sounds and feels very \"old school\" to me. In all honestly, feels like my keyboard from my Gateway 2000 I had back in the late 90's! I think it's be funny to do a blind test between this and a vintage PC keyboard. I'm not saying that's a bad thing whatsoever, but it does feel again, like it was a step back from the innovative silent keys on the strafe.I think that's about it. If will update my review as I go along.  Despite my cons, I absolutely love this keyboard and highly recommend it for both work and play. It just looks amazing, it's highly response, it doesn't move or slide around. I got nothing bad to say about the performance as well as aesthetics. My star docked was over the loudness and step back to an old-school \"feeling\" keyboard. I am largely comparing and contrasting it to the Strafe RGB. I also know that Corsair still offers the silent mechanical keyboards. But part of me just wishes that was adapted on all models. Still, love the keyboard, I'd definitely grab up the limited editions while they're hot!",
          "I won't lie, I wasn't dying for a new keyboard.  The only reason I even thought about replacing mine right now was because I just discovered this white K70, along with a few other new(ish) white components from Corsair.  I'm going all out with white on this build, I knew this keyboard would look great with my case.  I already had almost the whole suite of iCUE peripherals, (everything but the headphone stand) but only my M65 mouse was white.  It took a few days, but I convinced myself that I've gotten enough use to start replacing them (and luckily I have a nephew to hand my old stuff down to).  So I just bought the white Void headset, and this K70 Rapidfire keyboard.  Next my eyes are on the white H100 cooler...Form:As I already eluded to, the aesthetics of this keyboard were the primary reason I considered buying.  The brushed aluminum finish looks great, and is relatively easy to clean.  After a lifetime of beige keyboards, and then another lifetime of black keyboards, this thing is a sight for sore eyes.  The white keycaps cause the RGB to appear much brighter, almost neon.  The side-by-side picture I included shows both keyboards at full brightness.  So I don't know if the K95 is just that much more dim, has become dim over time, or is simply obscured by dust, etc.  Another bonus is the K70 has an extra USB pass-through, which the K95 did not have.  I have a sim racing rig with Oculus Rift, so I need all the USB's I can get.  This keyboard takes two itself, but the nice braided silver cord makes it easier to forgive.Function (hardware):Beside the fact that I could have used my K95 awhile longer, the only thing that gave me pause about this keyboard was the switches.  I chose MX Brown for the K95 because I didn't like the sound of ultra fast switches with less tactile feedback.  I was worried that I would have a lot of accidental presses, etc.  But I was surprised to find that these switches actually feel a lot better.  I've always been able to type fairly quick, but this keyboard just... makes you quicker.  The response and feedback is so precise that it feels like it's moving your fingers for you.  If you've never felt a mechanical keyboard or you're not sure what's right for you, I recommend going to Best Buy, Fry's, etc. and trying out what they have.  BB had one of these on display that I was able to try.Function (cleaning):From my experience with the K95, the main drawback with cleaning these keyboards is that you basically need to remove all of the caps in order to do a really thorough job.  But if you take the time to do that, you can actually clean this keyboard a lot better than most.  If you keep duster on-hand, you can blow it out pretty well and possibly avoid having to remove the caps.  The design is fairly spill-proof, but not completely of course.  I (inadvertently) tested this twice on the K95 with Rockstar Punched.  The first time I was able to clean it well enough that none of the keys felt sticky or lost function.  The second time was a worse spill, the media keys stopped working, and the numpad area still feels sticky.  I've tried to clean inside the caps and switches several times and it's gotten a little better, but can't fully get rid of the stickiness.  To be clear, I absolutely do not blame Corsair for my dumb self spilling Rockstar on the thing... twice.  That will not happen with this K70.Function (soft/firmware):iCUE has had it's share of issues, and it's still not perfect, but it is a very useful piece of software and it has improved a lot.  I don't need a separate program (Corsair Link) for the H115 anymore, it's all rolled into iCUE.  The software has a simple, intuitive design that makes it easy to create different lighting profiles and macros, and change different settings.  I actually enjoy the ritual of making a new profile for games that I play a lot, doing a few macros/remaps, setting a screenshot of the game for the iCUE background, and the game's logo as the profile icon.  Then you set the profile to run with the game/app's .exe and iCUE will automatically switch to your macros and lighting for that game whenever you launch it.  You can even pretend that the lights aren't ALL for show - if you use the Temperature Lighting Link, all of your iCUE RGB will change color according to the temperature of your motherboard, CPU, GPU, or AIO cooler.  In your face, everybody who said RGB is just a flashy, showy gimmick.  You're right, but still, in your face.  Another personal favorite lighting effect of mine is the Void Visualizer - only works with the Void headset but it's an RGB graphic equalizer... and that's... sigh... it's neat.After all of this praise, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that iCUE can be a little wonky when it comes to firmware updates.  This is one of the things that has improved the most over the last several years, but it's still not perfect.  Usually the problem is just a minor annoyance that doesn't remove any functionality.  While writing this review, I deleted the default profiles that came installed on the keyboard because I already had my custom iCUE profiles, and that appears to have caused an issue with the firmware.  Now it's telling me that there's an update for the K70's firmware, but the update is \"not available or failed to load.\"  Again, this doesn't remove any functionality, all of my profiles are still there and working correctly.  But it thinks it needs an update, and it can't do it.  The fix for this on Corsair Support's FAQ is to create a support ticket so they can send you the firmware - there is nowhere to go and download it yourself.  Then they apparently walk you through the process of doing a hard reset on the firmware.  I've never had to do anything like that before, usually I just wait awhile and it gets taken care of by a general software update.Bottom line:This keyboard isn't cheap, but if you can get it at $129 it's easier to stomach.  If there is a better RGB mechanical keyboard on the market, I'd sure like to see it.  Only docking one star because this color/finish option isn't available on a K95 with G keys (yet).  I'm sure they'll release one of those next week and I'll be kicking myself."

          "The price is definitely hard to grapple with if you've never experienced this keyboard, but as soon as you lift it out of the box and hold it you can tell that it's very solid and well built.  I actually bought a K95 literally a week before they announced the K100, so I've been patiently waiting this whole time to upgrade lol.My only real gripe with it so far is that if you have the legs up and move the keyboard a millimeter to the left or right, it will collapse the leg on that side, which is pretty annoying but you shouldn't need to be adjusting it too often anyway.  And as others have pointed out, the iCue software kinda sucks, but that isn't directly related to the keyboard itself.",
          "I bought the Cherry MX version for $200 before tax. 5 stars, easily, but there's some stuff you should know before buying.The great stuff:- durable, high-quality build- beautiful to look at- the volume wheel is remarkably useful for games and videos- the clicky sound of the Cherry MX provides pleasing feedback- the wrist pad is very comfortable and attached securely with magnetsStuff you should know:- The K100 has two USB cables. You can plug your mouse into the keyboard, but you still need to plug the two USB cables from the keyboard into your computer.- Corsair does not seem to guarantee compatibility with any KVM switch. I took a chance on \"UGREEN USB 3.0 Switch Selector 4 Port 2 Computers Peripheral Switcher Adapter Hub for PC Printer Scanner Mouse Keyboard with One Button Switch and 2 Pack USB Male Cable\" (ASIN B01N6GD9JO), and it has worked flawlessly. In my setup, I plug the two keyboard cables into the front of the KVM switch, and run one USB cable from the back to my PC and another one out the back to my laptop. I have a mouse plugged into the keyboard. I do not run the monitor through the KVM switch, opting instead to have two cables from the monitor, one to the PC, and one to the laptop.- Coming from a rubber dome keyboard (Logitech G15), the keys on the Corsair K100 felt incredibly sensitive to the touch. As someone who uses the keyboard to write computer code, I initially found this frustrating, as a very light press on a key could cause a character to register many times (like \"cccccccccccc\"). I could see how someone might want to ditch the keyboard immediately, but after about two or three weeks, I managed to retrain myself to avoid those \"heavy finger\" mistakes.- I don't use the wheel on the upper left of the keyboard. I don't use the G-macro keys.- There are a lot of preset color patterns. I settled on one after the novelty of the options wore off.- I don't find the shifting color pattern to be at all distracting, even while concentrating on writing computer code. It's pretty.- The keys have stylized symbols, which can be a little unusual if you have to hunt for a rarely-used key or if a child is trying to type on the keyboard. The biggest offender to me is the ampersand (&) on the \"7\" key.The bad stuff:- Not much, except that the keys may feel too sensitive if you haven't used a Cherry MX keyboard before, and your mileage may vary as to whether you can adapt to one. So $200+ for a keyboard that may end up frustrating you could be a risky proposition. I read the terms for returning the keyboard, and it doesn't look like you can return it once you've opened it. (Maybe you can, but that's how I interpreted the terms.) So be sure that you like sensitive keyboards or have confidence that you can adapt.- There is a Corsair logo on the wrist pad that kind of looks like it is on a piece of tap that should peel off. It isn't. The placement of the logo slightly annoys me, but maybe that's just me.Overall, a great keyboard and a happy purchase.",
          "I came from a K70 LUX and was initially hesitant about this keyboard. However, it was briefly on sale during Prime Day so I caved and grabbed one. My old board was Cherry MX Reds and this time I grabbed the Corsair OPX Optical switches.First impressions: The keys have a different texture / finish that the K70's keys, it feels slightly more rough, like mildly rough varnish of some sort. It's not unpleasant and actually prevents my hands from sliding off the keys like on the K70. The wrist mount (not shown in picture) is also very comfy but I find it quickly causes my wrists / hands to sweat.Typing: I typed approx. 100-120 wpm on my K70. The layout on the K100 is a bit different due to the macro buttons on the left side of the keyboard - my pinky keeps mistaking macro key G1 for ESC, but my muscle memory has been slowly rewiring over the past couple of days. This will likely be a common complaint early on however. I find typing on the K100 to be enjoyable and moreso than the K70 due to the speed of the Corsair OPX switches.Gaming: I most play Counterstrike: Global Offensive. As far as a twitch fps goes, the K100 is much more responsive than my K70 LUX was. I've set the hardware polling rate to 2000hz and my movement in CSGO has gotten much more responsive and quicker. It feels like the game got better, but really it's just my hardware that got better. Side note: playing CSGO on a 244hz monitor with a K100 feels like cheating half the time. I've already been kicked twice because people think I'm wallhacking.Build Quality: I've only had the keyboard for a few days now but it's holding up well. The keys seem more sturdy than the K70. You get what you pay for, and this keyboard /feels/ robust and built to last. For comparison, I had my K70 for 3 years before the comma key broke off, and that's after 1,300+ hours of gaming and 2,000+ hours of DMing text-based games in Roll20 for my D&D groups.Software: The Corsair iCue software is very intuitive and nice to use. I set my board to a static blue for preference but it has a lot of powerful features. For example, you can set the colours to match the relative temperature of your motherboard/cpu/gpu, letting you know when you're running hot. The colour wheel on the top left is useful for more than just rgb, and I appreciate it allowing for track jogging / skipping. The media controls are also great and the iCue software lets you remap keys to any other key of your choice.Macros: The Macro Keys (G1 - G6) can be disabled or set to do certain actions. For example, I've set G1 to open Google Chrome (my browser), and G2 opens Notepad++ (my word processor). G3 and G6 are disabled for now but they can be configured to perform game specific actions.Final Thoughts: Coming from the K70, some changes took getting used to but I adapted quickly and I appreciate the upgrades and build quality of Corsair as always. I am very happy with my purchase and feel it has benefited my gaming experience and typing speed.",
          "I replaced my Corsair K70 RGB (the OG one) with the K100 Air.  Ever since I started working from home- i.e. using multiple computers throughout the day- I've been wanting a better keyboard.My old, wired (with GIGANTIC dual USB cables) K70RGB had fantastic feel and features.  But I wanted to move it around more than the cables would allow.  Also a somewhat less gargantuan footprint would be appreciated; I still need the 10-key though.  Enter the K100 Air.- Still mechanical keys (more on this later)- Wireless = more mobile- RGB, G-keys (macros), 2.4Ghz or Bluetooth (or single USB wired)SO- I went for it on Day One, despite the *astronomical* price (nearly $300).\u2022 The K100 Air has made my life easier.  I can now use my own PC much more easily; I'm typing this on it now.  Moving the keyboard has also given me much more mousing room on the desk.  (I use another computer for work, with 2 monitors; it's to the right of my main PC (also with 2 monitors).It recharges via USB-C; when it's low on battery the lighting turns red.  Or you can check in iCue and it shows the battery % charge.  iCue also works fine for applying lighting- be sure you have version: 4.29.203 or newer, otherwise it won't recognize the keyboard.  If you just see the wireless dongle in iCue but not the keyboard, update your software.\u2022 For the feel and 'mechanical' keys:  it feels like the best laptop keyboard ever, but it does NOT feel like the mechanical Cherry switches you get on gaming keyboards.  The keys feel very solid and predictable, but they aren't at the same level as Corsair/Razer/Logitech mechanical keyboards.  I will say, the Corsair's keys are better than the (somewhat) low-profile keys on the Logitech G line (715, 915 etc).  The Logitech ones feel (and sound) more springy, which isn't that great for typing. (or gaming)\u2022 As far as build quality, this thing does look and feel like an expensive item.  It's metal on top, I believe plastic on the bottom.  The lighting shows through the keys very well, but it doesn't shine out from under the keys like a full-sized gaming keyboard.  It has a spot to store the dongle when it's plugged in.  I've only used it via 2.4Ghz wireless, and it has been flawless as far as connection.  You can plug the dongle into the back of a nearby PC directly and no connection problems.  Also no interference with multiple keyboards and mice also on 2.4Ghz.  The RGB lighting is adjustable from the keyboard, independent of the software.  Brightness and lighting patterns (pre-saved onto the keyboard via iCue) are controllable without software.  There's also a charge light, so you'll see it blinking and/or changing color when power is low.  The iCue software also puts up an alert when it needs a recharge, this happens before the lighting turns red.  Works well.  I have to charge it about 1.5 times per week, with the computer on 24/7 and asleep for about half that time.\u2022 One thing about waking up from sleep:  the keyboard takes about 4 to 5 seconds to wake up.  In the time you press the first key to when the lighting comes on, the keys still work and are read by the PC, but it's disconcerting to be typing on a black keyboard.  It does wake up fine, the lighting is just a bit slow.\u2022 Now, the key (ha) question:  is it worth the money?  As far as I can tell, this is the best low-profile wireless gaming keyboard available.  It has many nice touches, gives me more features than I can use, and beats the competition in both the hardware and usability.  Yes- it's really expensive.  But for something that is your main interface to a system you use constantly, it is probably worth paying the premium.  If I hadn't already got a Logitech for my work PC, I would get another one of these.  That probably tells you everything you need to know.",
          "I've owned tons of Corsair's previous keyboards starting with their early monocolor white led k95 to the various other iterations of the K70 and K95 that were released over the years. I've always had some issue with them that made me hope that it would be fixed. The first K95 had problems with the black on the keycaps wearing off and the led lights dying quickly. Later RGB versions seemed to fix the LEDs dying, but introduced issues with a single key press registering multiple keystrokes. Then the quality of the keycaps of newer releases seemingly degraded and were completely loose out of the box. So loose that if you tapped a key too quickly, the keycap would fly off the board. That got old very quickly. Then the K95 RGB Platinum also had the issue of some of the LEDs starting to become really dim compared to the other keys. I switched to the EVGA Z20 after I got fed up with the various issues, but found it had its own host of problems including random disconnecting from the computer and losing power regardless of what USB port I plugged it into.I discovered that Corsair had a new keyboard with a new type of optical switches and decided to give their keyboards one more chance. After some months of use, I have to say this keyboard is fantastic so far and all my previous issues with their keyboards appear to be gone.- The keys feel just right when typing.- The fonts used on the keyboard look a lot better and the keyboard overall has a classier look to it.- The keycaps are not loose in the slightest. They are snugly fitted to the switches and actually takes a bit of effort to pull them off so I'm not worrying about them flying off the keyboard anymore mid-game or while chatting.- There hasn't been a single instance of a single keypress registering multiple keystrokes. So far, the LEDs for these OPX switches have been holding up over the months and I hope they stay that way.- The keycaps are double shot so I don't have to worry about the paint on the keys coming off.- Not really a past issue per se, but perhaps due to the new OPX switches, it's not as loud when the keys bottom out while typing compared to the Cherry MX switches. An improvement in my opinion, but some people might prefer the louder clickety clack of the Cherry MX switches.As an added bonus, the wrist rest is also their best yet. It must use a memory foam inside as it has yet to flatten out even after applying a lot of pressure on like resting my elbows on it frequently. It's a huge improvement over the hard plastic wrist rests with the rubberized coating. It also conveniently snaps right onto the keyboard with magnets.If I were to list any cons, they would be:- Price. This is one expensive keyboard. I have had no issues with it so far, so I'll take it over having a cheaper keyboard with problems.- Easy to accidentally press a key if you're not careful as they are linear and don't require a whole lot of force. Also, they have a VERY short actuation distance.- I find the scroll wheel to only be mildly useful, but that's just my based on my own needs and usage.",
          "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n",
          "Pros:- Can connect to multiple devices. Connections were mostly stable.- Good RGB- Profile/height felt nice- WirelessCons:- Very expensive- Build felt a bit cheaper than previous experiences with Corsair- Squeaky spacebar (I'm sure this isn't all of them, but mine does - incredibly annoying)- Can't remove keycapsAfter using it for a couple months, I have a hard time recommending this. I used this for both work and gaming. Out of the box the quality felt a little sub-par. The casing feels great but I just couldn't like the feel of the keys. The keycaps feel a bit cheap and the tactility of the bump is too much IMO. Anyone who appreciates a low-profile keyboard is probably coming from typing on a laptop, and this felt far too \"heavy\" to be emulating a laptop keyboard experience. Wireless was great overall, but I did have the occasional double input (but rarely).My spacebar squeaks, and the inability to remove the keycaps means I'm stuck with it. All preferences aside, even if I did like the feel of the keyboard more, the noise is what made me have to switch back. Incredibly annoying for something as repetitive as typing (and the spacebar, at that). All in all, really can't recommend this product at this price point. I've used better-feeling low-profile keyboards from Logitech at a third of the price.",
          "The performance of the mechanical switch is excellent. The response time is so good I don't even feel it. Miss key inputs and FPS never happens anymore. The cable is long and solid. The controls are solid and obvious. And the lighting is able to be shut off or put through multiple settings... The default fading and color is actually pleasing. It's not a cheap rainbow. The key stroke sound is quite pleasing. Even my wife and child enjoy hearing it. LolThe keys are sensitive. I am a touch typist and have proper hand placement hovering over keys. But at times I feel like it picks up key hits from light changing in the room or my hand moving and changing the lighting over the keys. Maybe that's the optical sensors? I would assume that isn't an issue but considering I've hit keys without touching the keyboard... It can be the only thing I can imagine. I think that is a minor trade-off considering my old Logitech would outright ignore key input and I'd get killed. Super frustrating with that old one. This keyboard does what I tell it to do the instant I touch the key.",
          "I've never had a real mechanical keyboard, other than the plastic ones I used at work.I used some work rewards to buy this one.  I seriously enjoy the RGB and the action of this keyboard and love it's responsiveness.My only complaint is that it has a ringing sound.  When typing, it rings slightly like a bell. I believe it's because of the aluminum case.After careful consideration and watching a few Youtube videos, I bought some silencer foam, cracked open the keyboard and placed it in under the casing.  It has seriously reduced or even eliminated the ringing sound.I'm not sure if the ringing was a defect of only the keyboard I received, or if it is something that all of these have. I just wanted to advise that this may happen if you buy one.  It is fixable if you want to take the change of opening the board up.  I am by no means an expert on mechanical keyboards. I am happy with this one.",
          "I really like this compared to my previous Corsair Vengeance K70 with MX Brown (which I kept for use on another system). I like these optical switches better, definitely a lot more sensitive, still learning not to rest fingers on them or they register but otherwise, I really like them. The sound they make when you release them is not that pleasant, so if you are a bottom out typer, you might not like the sound this makes. It is still quieter than my MX Brown keyboard but not by much. I played with a display model of a cheap $60 Logitech keyboard I found at a retail store, it has generic \"brown\" switches and the sound of it was amazing compared to this $200 fancy keyboard, incredibly quiet and pleasing sound for a tactile. This K100 also takes some time to get used to with the macro keys on the left, I have always used full size keyboards but this one is awkward cause of the macro keys, I keep hitting G1 instead of Esc but, I'm slowly getting used to it. you must run stream deck AND iCUE software to program the macro keys",

          "I've only had it a day but I wanted to write a review in case there were others on the fence about the key choices.The optical keys are about as perfect as it gets. Not a keyboard junky, but still based on my exposure of various key types over the last 20+ years.Short throw, very responsive with I feel like is the perfect balance between typing and feedback.Already I feel my self typing better because it seems almost effortless.Also the keyboard has an ideal weight to it. Don't move around on my desk. Has a very solid feel.Some reviews complain about the per LED lighting control. I found in pretty easy, only slightly cumbersome. Have to consider it's going to be tedious no matter what if you want to set up a lot of key groups. I setup quite a few. I got different static colors for the function keys, the macro keys, the whole number pad area, etc. I only animate the media keysSome evaluation remains. Like I haven't done any serious gaming with it, nor have I used the macro keys yet. I'll update my review if I find any cons.",
          "I opted for the optical model, any little press of the key is registered. I've walked off maps more times than I can count because of the light resistance of the keys. It does take some getting used to, but I do type much faster now. If ur after RGB, this keyboard has it is ACES lol. Integrates with iCue for RGB and Hotkey controls. Has the Windows Lockout Key so you don't accidentally open the start menu while spamming Ctrl or Alt. The Hot Keys are a bit annoying, I'm used to ESC being the top left of my keyboard, but the hot key is now, so I find myself fumbling when needing a menu. Wrist rest is magnetically held to the front bottom of the keyboard, it pulls off kinda easily, but it's good as long as ur not rough. Keyboard still has a USB passthrough on the back. Overall, I like it.",
          "By and large, this is a very good keyboard, but it does suffer from some glitches.The most annoying one sporadically requires the USB connectors to be disconnected from the computer then reconnected in order to get the keyboard to work again.  I have no idea what causes it and it only happens randomly about once a week, but it shouldn't happen at all - especially given the cost of the keyboard.  (I am past my window for return or exchange).Another annoyance is that the indicator lights on the left side (Windows lock and mute for example) are only about half as bright as the indicator lights on the right side (cap and scroll lock for example).",
          "TLDR: Premium keyboard loaded with features in a package as solid feeling as it looks.Pros:- Excellent build quality- Smooth optical switches- Up to 8k polling rate (to further take advantage of the optical switches)- Excellent sounding stabilizers right out of the box!- Very nice included wrist rest- Macro (G-key) streamdeck integration- Fully remappable (except for the icue button on the top left)- Double shot PBT keycaps- Standard Bottom row (can use just about any key cap set you want)- Bright RGB lighting with many preset effects and customization (can layer up to 20 effects)- Compatible with iCUE nexus- Can save lighting effects, macros, and profiles directly to the keyboardCons:- The included wrist rest's geometric pattern locks in grime quite easilyThoughts:Everything about this keyboard screams PREMIUM and QUALITY! Typing feels fantastic with the new OPX mechanical switches. They're smoother than cherry (as are pretty much everything these days) and sound great on the board. The stabilizers feel absolutely fantastic! No rattles at all. Finally! The worst part about corsair keyboards in the past (in my opinion) were the stabilizers. There was nothing you could do to those stupid wires to make them tolerable. The OPX mechanical switches are \"speed\" switches, meaning that they have a higher actuation point than switches you may be used to. Regular reds or linears actuate at about 2mm, where these actuate at 1mm. If you're not used to speed switches, you may make a lot of typos or walk off of cliffs alot for a while, but after getting used to them, you can hardly tell they're as high actuating as they are. The lighting is very bright and beautiful. I recently tried Razer's new huntsman analog, and nothing about it can hold a candle to this keyboard. If you're trying to decide between the two, there's absolutely no competition there. The wheel in the top left can do various things like adjust lighting, or scrub through music or videos. It's a nice little addition. The volume control is also very tight feeling. I've felt many keyboards with dedicated volume wheels that feel real loose, but this one's very nice.Conclusion:This is as good of a gaming keyboard as you can get right now. It is absolutely loaded with features in a package that feels as solid as it looks. While being fairly pricy, you definitely get what you pay for with this. I highly recommend getting the optical switches since the other selection is a cherry speed switch anyway. The OPX switch feels great and better takes advantage of the 8k polling rate available on the board (not that mega high polling rates REEEALLY make a huge difference on keyboards). That said, I would recommend the OPX switch over the cherry speed switch because its just a much smoother feeling switch. If you've ever used anything besides cherry, you know everything's better than cherry and that's no exception here. The cherry switches are very scratchy through their actuation. The OPX switches make a sort springy sound sometimes, usually on rapid presses, but nothing that you feel, so it's not enough to recommend against it. The OPX switches also feel lighter, probably because they're so much smoother which just feels much better in games.*update 3/16/2021:Corsair has released a new version of iCue that is much more modern, easy to use, and not bad to look at. It's more responsive when making changes and adds 8k polling rate to the K100.",
          "Bought this keyboard Janurary 2021 so I've had a year to decide if actually like this or not. And so far, I think it's a great keyboard. In fact, I even bought lube for the switches so I can take care of if a bit better. After using a GSkill keyboard with those loud Cherry MX Blue switches that people could hear through my mic, I decided to switch to the Corsair OPX switches and I am extremely happy with them.Overall, it's a great keyboard. I love the media keys on this; volume wheel butter smooth. I bought the version with the OPX switches from Corsair and I'm very much happy. Keys are actuation point is very small so it makes typos and accidental presses very easy, especially for me that has some big, heavy hands, so keep that in mind. Keys are smooth and build quality seems to be pretty good with 2 relatively small issues.First issue is the space bar. After having it for 2-3 days, I developed this sorta \"ring\" to it where a press can make this strange noise that vaguely sounds like I plucked a string on a guitar or something. I type pretty \"angrily\" as I've been told so that seems to be the case. Really minor but for $220 (when I bought it) I expect near-perfection.Second issue is the button in the middle of the twist knob. It's just lazily set in there and wobbles a lot. It's not gonna fall out or anything, but the normally tight keyboard has this one button that is very loose.Couple notes here. Wrist rest is nice and magnetically attached (VERY nice touch; I love it). I wish the cushion was softer like ones on Razer keyboards but it's still a nice wrist rest with a nice texture/pattern on it. iCUE software has been noticeably improved and not horrible like the previous version. RGB lighting is great and fairly easy to set-up, though not as intuitive as Razer's software which is laughably easy.IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're having issues with your keyboard where you have this horrendous input delay that spikes randomly, even in single player games, disable your game optimizer and that should fix the issue. Or at least figure out if you can somehow make it so it doesn't put your keyboard into a low-priority/background state. Razer Cortex did this for me and it was painful to troubleshoot. I have since kept Razer Cortex game optimizer off and have had 0 issues since then.",
          "I'm a fan of corsair's products, having grabbed many of their items in the past month. I picked up the K100 a few weeks ago and I've been deeply impressed with it. It's easily my favorite keyboard, and that includes my old Logitech G213 keyboard, which is simple, but effective. I've been needing a new keyboard for work, since I've had complaints about the volume of my G213 (which is strange, because it's not a mechanical keyboard) and I've just been so much more impressed with the quality of my Corsair keyboard. I was going to purchase another K100, but saw the K100 Air on sale, and figured I'd give it a try.PROSThe overall feel of the keyboard is surprisingly nice. I was expecting something much more like a laptop with the low profile keys, but I was wrong. The keys are flat, but they have a slightly larger surface area than regular keys, and still give a nice tactile feel when they're pressed, followed by a slightly dampened, but no less recognizable click.The lighting effects (RGB) are the same as on the full size K100, and are controlled the same way as well. I use this keyboard with my work laptop so I don't have iCue software downloaded, but I can still control the effects manually.The build quality of this keyboard is just as good as on the full size K100. It's metal construction, and despite its slim profile, it has some weight to it. Not a ton, but just enough to give a really nice feel.CONSThe keys are a bit different, and take a little bit of breaking in and getting used to. It took me all day to really get the hang on typing at my usual speed on this.The lighting is a bit on the dimmer side. If you're expecting a full-on light show like you get on the full-size version of this keyboard, you're going to be disappointed.This is indeed a great keyboard, but I'm not 100% convinced it's worth the price Corsair is asking for it. It's pretty steep.Overall, it has a very steep price tag, but I'm happy with it so far. The switches are ultra-responsive despite their low action, and feel great after a decent break-in period. The lighting isn't as bright as one would like, but considering I'm using this for work, It's probably better that it's a bit more subtle. It's another incredible keyboard from Corsair, despite the high asking price. I would definitely purchase another one.",
          "If you like squishy, linear, \"red\" switches, you will hate this keyboard. If you like the feel of laptop keyboards, but want a high quality mechanical version for a desktop computer, this keyboard is for you.Switches:The switches have a very nice tactile feel (like a Cherry Blue), but not clicky. This is what I think brown switches should be. It takes more force to push the keys over the bump, and you *know* you activated the key.  It's great because you won't accidentally press keys while resting your fingers on the keys. They have very short travel distance.Key caps:Clean font. No light bleed from under keys from RGB LEDs - elegant not flashy. Key caps are not replaceable. Corsair warns that removing them may damage the switch. The keys with a lot of text, like \"print screen\", have a bright spot in the middle where the LED is, and fades out on the edges. This looks non-premium.Ergonomics:The keyboard is completely flat. Most keyboards have a concave arc to the keys. or at least the keys are shorter in the home row and angled in the far rows. to make it easier to reach the keys. Not thise keyboard - it like a laptop keyboard in this way. The adjustable feet don't tilt the keyboard very high.Build:Keyboard has metal top plate and has no flex. It feels very well made. The corners are a little sharp.",
          "Why Corsair... Why? Why did you have to make such a nice keyboard, only to fit it with 1.0mm actuation point switches? So many typos. Typos everywhere. I actually type even slower with this board vs something like a Cherry MX Red board because I have to tip-toe my fingers around the switches.In my opinion, the Cherry MX Red switches had the perfect actuation distance of any switch. A full 4.0mm travel distance with an actuation distance at 2.0mm. Do typos still happen? Sure, but this keyboard cuts that actuation in HALF. Almost every sentence I type has a typo because if you type too quickly or even just gently nudge your finger against another key it'll trigger. It's incredibly infuriating if you have to use it for work or any kind of typing usage instead of gaming.I also don't like how short the key travel is in general. I honestly think gaming with Cherry MX Reds is superior, since you can accidentally trigger an Ultimate by mistake in Overwatch with this board.Corsair employees, if you're reading this review, please pass it on to the upper management. Stop making this \"XTREME\" gaming gear. Give people a mid-range option with normal actuation distances. I can guarantee you most people would prefer a 2.0mm actuation option. Maybe even a tactile optical switch such as a MX Brown/MX Blue knockoff or something. If you could make a 45g Cherry MX Blue knockoff with a sharper click, and still keep it optical, I think that would be the end-game.Other than that, the keyboard's RGB and features are amazing. The 6 macros on the side are amazing. I have streaming radio stations macro'd in the iCue software. Then I have another profile for work with text-templates since I do alot of copy/pasting type stuff. It's very helpful.All-in-all, it's not a terrible board by any means. I still give it a solid 8/10. Would I buy it again? Eh, I would probably get the older K95 generation boards with the Cherry MX Browns over this one instead unless you absolutely must have optical switches with a 1.0mm actuation.",
          "I've never had a reason to dislike the keyboard I've been using for the past many months. I've been happy with its performance, the overall look, the full size, etc. It's not mechanical though, and even though I'm not a hardcore gamer, I like to have nice hardware in my setup. I know Corsair by its excellent reputation, and I saw that this was the biggest, baddest keyboard that they make. I was intrigued, so I went for it.PROSOn-board controls are a breeze to use. The volume adjustment wheel is a particularly nice touch. I've never had a reason to dislike the volume control button on my old keyboard, but this works great for both gradual and rapid volume adjustment. The other media keys work seamlessly as well.The keys themselves look AND feel great. They have a slightly rough texture to them, which keeps them from getting that annoying oily look. My old keyboard has a sort of satin looking finish that shows every bit of sweat or oil. These look and feel great at all times.The on-board RGB control is wonderfully easy to use if you just want the basic options. you can use the keyboard to cycle through ten different effects pre-loaded on the keyboard, plus you can also control the effect speed.The RGB effects themselves are fantastic. The back lighting is nice and bright, and the keys light up beautifully. It looks really cool in a dark room, but you can also see the keys very clearly in a brightly lit room as well.The aluminum body makes this the toughest and most solid keyboard I've ever used. It's quite heavy, which is fine for me, as I don't need this to be portable at all.The built-in wrist rest is really excellent. It's nice and soft, possibly some kind of memory foam, or something like that. I know a lot of people have expressed that they find it adds unnecessary size and heft to the keyboard, but I'm usually typing quite a bit throughout the day, and it really comes in handy.I know a lot of people have expressed that this should strictly be for gaming, but I would have to disagree. It may be more sensitive than most regular keyboards, but I find this so much more pleasant to type on than any other keyboard I've ever owned. The satisfying sound of the keys really drives this home for me. I got the model with the Cherry switches instead of the optical.CONSThe software can be pretty confusing for people like myself who aren't as well versed in this type of thing. I was able to navigate it to a certain degree, but ended up just deleting it from my computer afterwards.The iCue control wheel feels a bit flimsy to me, especially for such an expensive piece of equipment.Overall, this is a truly breathtaking keyboard. I'm extremely satisfied with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a top-notch gaming keyboard with some of the best RGB effects I've seen.",
          "I've had this keyboard since February 22, 2021 and it's been very good. Previously a had a red led K98 which still holds up very well but I decided to go for this fast beast. The transition took me about 8 days to get used to because this keyboard (K100) has somewhat smaller keys. They are not bad  and are very good. I'm sure the keys are a bit smaller and closer (less distance between each other). Either way, I can't do anything but recommend this keyboard. The only reason it is not perfect is that the little legs that lift it from the desk go from Left to right and right to left instead of the classical approach from the screen to you... This design sometimes causes those flaps to fold and the keyboard \"fall\"  if you move the keyboard around too much. Changing that to the classic approach would do it for me. The other thing is that the software doesn't have many useful options for the iCue branded button on the top left of the keyboard. I would like to see the software giving access to it via API so we could give it some nice uses. Other than that I can only say it's been fantastic. I know it's a top of the line keyboard and it is pricey but if you can save for it then you will never have to look back. Good job to everyone @ Corsair that made this product possible. This keyboard is here to stay.",
          "solo que se quitan las teclas con facilidad",
          "I may be a little biased but almost every gaming peripheral I own is built by Corsair. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s hype or if they truly are at the top of their weight class, but I have yet to be let down by a single product of theirs. Typing feels incredible (especially if you're into that OG click clack sound), the keys are really sensitive (perfect for gamers who need quick key press reactions), and the RGB...... WOW..... The number of lighting modes and effects you can set up is actually bonkers. I can't even begin to describe how easy the iCUE software makes it when designing the \"perfect\" theme. This is a must if you're already in the Corsair ecosystem.",
          "I didn't enjoy the typing experience on my Razer Huntsman Elite and decided to give the K100 a try.  Very happy with the purchase.  High quality components and a great typing experience (the right balance of resistance and easy presses on the Cherry Speed switches).  I use mine for typing and gaming and it excels at both.",
          "I like the keyboard except for how sensitive the keys are. You can just about activate the key by breathing on it. For games where I am moving forward with W I am frequently also unintentionally hitting A as well so my character will start turning left. This happens mostly when I am sprinting by holding down Shift. Its been a few months and I still haven't gotten used to it. I wish I could swap out the switches.",
          "Pros:- Keyboard build quality is solid. Everything feels premium and has a good feel.- VERY nice wrist rest. I'm usually not a fan of them but this one is awesome. It is also magnetic so easily slides into and out of the keyboard.- Has Cherry MX key switches which, by most accounts, are the best in the biz.- Silent, linear switches (personal preference)- Low operating force. It may not seem like much, but it is good for preventing fatigue during 8-12 hour gaming sessions.- Volume wheel is a nice feature. My prior \"gaming\" keyboard did not have one.- Very nice RGB effects.- Surprisingly, one of the few \"gaming\" keyboards that come with macro keys.- Is a full size (includes 10 key number pad). Some people are switching to TKL so less full-size gaming keyboards are being launched which is disappointing.- Non-cased design (also a bit of a con) making it easy to clean- Decent software for lighting, macros, etc that includes lots of lighting optionsCons:- Keys are VERY sensitive. This is by design to give the lowest travel distance for input to register. However, with the low operating force (45 cN), and my habit of having a heavy hand while hovering my keys, I found myself accidentally dodge rolling into enemies, miss clicking/fat fingering skills, etc. Note that I've gotten used to it over time. But I would advise not playing any high stakes or competitive game modes when you first get it if you're coming from a keyboard with higher operating force keys.- The \"control wheel\" feels very gimicky. Never do I feel the need to use it. Feels like an added feature just to bump up the price.- Non-cased design. I feel it looks a little less... professional looking? When the keycaps are exposed. May be personal preference.- With no tactile feedback and very low operating force, it's not a great typing keeb for those of us who work (type emails, write papers for school, etc) where we play. As an experienced typist, I find myself fat fingering keys more often than on any other keeb I've owned.Conclusion: This is a good gaming keyboard with excellent build quality and performs very well for what it is made for. Gaming. If you can get used to the sensitive keys, this serves well for what it was designed for while I wouldn't recommend for big typing jobs like emails or papers. It's also sure to significantly improve the aesthetics of your gaming set-up with its awesome design and bright, customizable RGB lighting.",
          "well it all works but i well tell you more after i have had it for 6 month so stay tune for june to come",
          "I've purchased over a dozen \"thin,\" \"slim,\" and \"low profile\" keyboards over the past few years, trying to find something that had limited extra buttons, keys with quick response times, and generally felt like quality.This keyboard is fantastic, but super expensive. If you want a slim keyboard with responsive, laptop-like keys, with limited bells and whistles, RGB (very nice tie-ins to Corsair's other products with RGB), and you have a preference for either wireless/corded (both are supported), this is probably the keyboard for you. IF you want to spend this much.To date, this is probably my tied-for-favorite keyboard. The Logitech K750 Solar Wireless Keyboard was my favorite to use, but the solar panels were obnoxious and the keyboard only had a year lifespan or so before having to be thrown out. The Corsair is thicker, but still very slim, and the keys are more responsive. The Corsair is just 3x more expensive.",
          "Keyboard is absolutely amazing, but the volume rocker stopped working on me unfortunately. It's finicky, when i turn it down it turns up and when I turn it down it goes up or down randomly. I baby this keyboard and take care of it. It is in mint condition. Everything else about this keyboard is amazing.",
          "Google \"Corsair K100 RGB Freezing\" and you'll find a bunch of people complaining about it just dying when in normal use. No rhyme or reason, just freezes. This started happening after the latest keyboard firmware update.The worst part is this has been an issue for over 5ish months now and has NOT been resolved. Corsair's iCUE programs allows you to update via a file, but there's no file to download, so downgrading is impossible. Corsair never released the firmware files, so who knows. They've been trying to \"diagnose\" the issue for a while now with NO progress or information, they just pulled the firmware and did nothing else.I can't return the keyboard for a refund, and we can't fix it ourselves because Corsair refuses to cooperate and help us by releasing these firmware files.I worked around the issue by plugging the keyboard into the passthrough slot and replugging it when it freezes (which is about 1-2x a day depending on it's mood). Not impressed, for a $250 keyboard this is bad business, and has left one heck of a bad taste in my mouth.It sucks because I quite like the keyboard itself. Some features are a bit useless, like the wheel on top (barley any customization allowed by iCUE), but the build quality is good. Typing is comfy too.Will update if/when they get off their whatevers and fixes this issue, but I'd stay away for now. There's other, cheaper, and less bug-free keyboards to choose from.",
          "Very Sturdy and responsive keyboard.  The only caveat I will note is that it takes a few days to get use to it after using a laptop keyboard for a few years.  Also there is no on key indicator of a caps or numlock being on.  It does show in a small display area at the top of the keyboard, but after using a keyboard with the indicator light on key for years, it is not where I would like to see it.",
          "Some thoughts on the K100:1. You will need to adjust your muscle memory because of the macro keys on the side. I know I've pressed the G1 key way too many times instead of Esc or G6 instead of Ctrl.2. Windows Lock key is very useful and the settings for it are customizable, the scroll wheel is a bit too fancy and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Media keys and volume rocker are what you expect and are nice to have.3. Hardware level macros (HID) are really great. When you play games that check for software macros, this keyboard can playback macros at the hardware level with some of the features intact (you can still set delays even with hardware playback which is really nice). You will need to completely close CUE however to enable Hardware playback which is really annoying, they should allow you to use Hardware macros as a toggle instead of closing the software.4. The macros themselves are amazing and terrible at the same time. For use cases like hardware macros mentioned above, this keyboard is great. For something as simple as \"press 2 keys at once\" so that 2 keys are polled at the same time at a hardware level on a single key, it can't be done elegantly. A workaround would be to use \"retain original key output\" but is only restricted to the original keys and not custom. Powerful and inelegant at the same time.5. The actuation of the keys themselves (Cherry MX Speed in my case) is extremely sensitive. This can be good and bad. The good is that you can type fluidly and press keys with minimal effort which reduces strain on your hands. The bad is that even merely resting your hands on the keys will trigger them. If you are holding a key but happen to lightly graze another key because your hands/fingers are resting, then you will lose the original input of holding a key down, this means I feel like my hands are hovering over the keys most of the time just to avoid losing inputs on keys I hold for games because the keys are so sensitive.6. The RGB is what you would expect out of RGB keyboards: unicorn disco vomit out of the box and customizable to something more reasonable with the software. The settings can also be saved on hardware playback when CUE is closed which is nice.7. This keyboard is heavy. Wire is chunky and not detachable. This is not a knock on the keyboard itself but just know that it takes up desk real-estate and you should expect it to be a permanent fixture to your set up and not something you can easily move to the side or easily relocate.8. The price is extremely high. To justify the price tag, you should know what you want out of this keyboard vs the many other cheaper and comparable alternatives on the market. I wouldn't recommend peripherals at this price range because it can be better budgeted toward improving your PC instead but if you're in the market for this kind of luxury then it's pretty nice.",
          "The padded wrist rest is held to the keyboard by magnets. There is something off with it and it slides and will make keys on your bottom row (spacebar, ctrl, arrows, etc) stick. Some people use tape to make a shim to prevent this. If you google it, you will see it is an issue that has been around for quite a while. I am surprised they have not fixed this. It is disappointing to spend so much on something to have something so silly be so problematic.The keyboard is otherwise pretty awesome. I upgraded from the K85 which has no wrist pad issues.",
          "This is definitely on the mark expensive side of gaming keyboards. I don't find myself really using the dial on the top-left of the keyboard all that much unless I'm trying to turn down the brightness. Otherwise, solid keyboard. If you're willing to spend a little more, then I'd recommend it. Otherwise, keep looking.",
          "I got the short quiet switches. It works beautifully! It also comes with an extra WASD for general gaming and an additional set for MOBA gaming, plus a tool to remove the keys. The extra keys are textured and angled to keep your fingers in place instead of sliding off. A+ for that!Be very careful with the short switches, though. Literally just the weight of resting my fingers on the keys occasionally triggers them. Suddenly strafing and not knowing why is a bit jarring. Not hearing the nice CLICK of the shift key because it moved so slowly, and pressing harder, getting more confused as to why I can't just hit the darn key, only to realize it's been activated the entire time is a bit frustrating. However, this is all based on the short switches. I imagine the regular switches are probably less sensitive. (I read all the warnings about this and ignored them. I promise you, the warnings are valid!)Honestly, my only \"complaint\" is that I don't like the G1-G6 keys on the left side. But that's 100% personal preference. I don't have a use for them, and they get in the way a bit.If you have any possible opportunity to try the keyboard out first, absolutely go for it! All my complaints are pretty much personal preference. It's a good keyboard with too easy to activate keys and a few extra keys I don't really have a use for. It may be a 5 star option for you! It's more like a 4.5 stars for me. So close, but not quite a bullseye.",
          "I know nothing about the differnt switches, and I haven't used a proper keyboard in a while.  I got the optical switch option, and they seem similar to the Cherry brown switches on the switch tester that I bought.  All the keyboard functions seem to work so far, and I am excited to start using this for gaming!This keyboard connects with two usbs, though only one seems to actually connect the keyboard and the 2nd one just hangs off, like an a half dead conjoined twin.EditI\"ve only been using it for the past like 2 days.  During game play (Wild Hearts, Apex, Dead by daylight, etc) sometimes my character will make a sudden random sharp left turn.  I kinda thought that was just me being stupid, but 2NP9--Hf6bpwx98And as I was typing this review it happened.  Keystroke Ghosting (although this looks more like someone was trying to type in a product code?).  I'm not sure what's causing it, I don't think it's mechanical, so it's gotta be electrical.  The ghosting stopped when I unplugged the keyboard (it has two usbs as I stated before, I only plugged the working one back in), so I doubt someone mysteriously connected to my computer.  Guess i'll leave a text doc open and see if it types anything else in.",
          "I was pretty skeptical about the optic switches coming from linear reds and being a gamer/typing enthusiast. The additional features on the K100 are way more than just gimmicks to throw in. The macro recorder has some SERIOUS potential in combination with the G-keys and a great addition for anyone doing work in Premiere or Photoshop. There's enough onboard memory to have a profile for literally every game or program you wanna use and you can even set up custom keyboard lighting for each one. This wheel on the keyboard can be used for pretty much anything like alt tabbing, scrubbing through video, inventory wheels in games, you name it.The switches are still very mechanical feeling but they aren't loud and intrusive. The travel distance is pretty much perfect and the board doesn't echo the switch sounds either. I'd say with some o-rings you could make this keyboard borderline silent and still feel great to play games and type with. These switches have a smooth straight travel and crazy good actuation. I mean you could probably drop a tic tac on theses switches and make them go off but they got just enough resistance to prevent accidental presses even with your hands resting on them. Some people say for typing you need some tactile feedback but with these switches I don't feel it's necessary. They're so consistent you get used to feather weighting your strokes and flying through paragraphs with the only errors being user ones.The volume rocker is very precise and I can't remember if the original photos show this but it also comes with a keycap remover and extra keys that have a diamond texture with ramped shape for ESDF and WASD users. It also includes QRF and maybe an extra W key I can't remember exactly. It also has a USB passthrough on the back of the board that lets you route your headset through inlets under the board which is a nice feature someone might find use for. It's worth noting this keyboard has a great wrist rest that slides effortlessly into the board. It can also be removed and you can opt to use a different wrist rest that you purchased from Sub Zero, Glorious Gaming etc.All in all this is an awesome keyboard. The price might be a deal breaker for some but I'd say the build quality, switch consistency, durability and additional features will fend off buyers remorse. If you've heard people bashing the iCue software calling it a memory hog just dismiss them. It's currently using 35mb of RAM and it's never intrusive in any way. In fact I wouldn't even know it was running if I never opened my system tray. The UI does need a little work but any moderately competent PC user will be able to navigate it just fine and do the things you need to accomplish. In fact the macro recording feature can be done without using the software so the only real time I need to open it is when I'm fiddling with lighting schemes or setting up different profiles.",
          "I thought my keyboard was dead after 2 weeks of gaming. It needed to be reset and it was a simple fix.great keyboard. The Icue app is difficult to work with but the gaming feel and key response is the best.It arrived early and it was packaged well. You might need some assistance from u tube to fine tune a thing or two. When I said best, I was referring to  better keys than my G910 Logitec keyboard that is a ranked high with me.",
          "Let me tell you, when I say this is literally the best keyboard I've owned in my entire life, I mean it with every inch of my very being. This keyboard is absolutely PHENOMENAL. If you ever thought Razer had quality, then you need to set your eyes on this absolute beast.I can tell you, the utility wheel does not get in the way of your gaming. In fact, there's a lock button right next to the wheel that disables it entirely. However, as someone who draws a lot on a tablet, I LOVE the utility of the keyboard as a whole. I can adjust the volume without opening up the slider, I can preprogram functions on my wheel that I can use on my art program, and I can even change the music on my keyboard with the onboard buttons right above the keypad. Even if you don't have a lot of use for things like this, the keyboard itself is fantastic.I don't personally know a lot about specifics when it comes to what specs modern gaming keyboards have, but I really love the switches on this keyboard. I've always loved the clicky-claky tapping of a mechanical keyboard, so I was a little disappointed when I first started typing. Then, I realized, the sound of this keyboard is really therapeutic. The sound is so much more hollow, and relaxing, I feel like I want to write a book just for the sake of listening to the keyboard. Plus, it's a lot quieter, so you won't bother your friends as much over voice.The macro keys are always a plus to have, but they can sometimes get in the way, at least, for me, since I tend to use escape a lot.However, I do have a personal issue with the keyboard's design. The keys are sensitive. You might think it a weird problem, but given how heavy handed I tend to be with my resting hand, I find myself accidentally pressing buttons I don't mean to be pressing. At first, I also thought this to be a specialized feature-- you know, the ones that try to simulate a controller by lightly pressing on a key like you would slowly pushing a thumbstick. Nope. After trying it on a few games, it's simply just a sensitive stroke.BUT, don't let that deter you from the absolute quality this keyboard has. After switching from a Razer Blackwidow to this, it's SO much lighter, and thinner compared to it. A personal favourite I've come to love about this keyboard are the lights on the edge. Of course, that's a feature with Corsair's firmware, iCue, but putting an audio visualizer on it while you're listening to music is a cherry on top.I don't know what more else I can say about the keyboard, other than I love it. Quite literally the best money I've ever spent on a keyboard.",
          "I got this for my husband as his last keyboard was broken after years of use and he only spent $20 on it. He loves this one, it\u2019s so much better",
          "'Wow' is all that I can say when describing this keyboard.  With keyboards, it seems that you start loving the feel and design of whichever keyboard you've been using for a while.  For me, that was the original K70 RGB back in 2014.  Having the first ever RGB keyboard, it was aesthetically beautiful.  But being that it was my first ever mechanical keyboard, I remember dreading my crummy typing accuracy for college papers.  But fast forward to after using it for just a few weeks and all of a sudden, I started to love the keyboard not only for its RGB aesthetics, but also for how much faster my typing became; how much faster my key inputs were for gaming; and how I didn't have to experience that crummy key ghosting issue whilst gaming (which happened often on my previous, non-mechanical keyboards).But as time moves on, eventually you feel the need to upgrade.  But due to how accustomed I was to my K70 RGB, I ended up grabbing this one with the Cherry MX Speed Silvers!  And it feels soooo dang great!  I've thrown some custom keycaps onto it and it feels just like I remember how my K70 felt (but possibly even better with the keycaps, haha).So I'm thinking that this will stay my keyboard for close to a decade since it has polling rate settings that can be pushed all the way up to 8,000hz for future proofing it's input response time.So, TL;DR:- Nice keyboard- Nice Speed Silver switches- Takes a week or two of typing on it before you get used to the speed silver switches (just as it was with me initially using my Cherry MX Red switches on the OG K70).So if you get this keyboard, don't stress about any mistypes for a bit.  As once you get adjusted to the switches in a few weeks, you'll become a keyboard legend, haha.  I love this keyboard!  Enjoy the pic, stay safe, stay healthy and most importantly: get/stay happy!",
          "I upgraded to this from a K65 Rapidfire and my initial impression is this: it's much easier to type on.PROS:I love these switches. The actuation distance is shorter than Silvers, but they're not so sensitive, so they're not as easy to make typos on if you use your computer for things other than playing games.It feels very solid and the keycaps have a pleasant texture to them. The wrist rest is comfortable and easy to remove for keyboard cleaning.I have all my peripherals connected to iCUE, so the macro keys and other things are very helpful for being lazy about stuff.However, there are some minor issues.CONS:- The wheel can only be used as a jog wheel on a few programs like iTunes and Spotify. It doesn't work with YouTube music, VLC, and whatever else.- The little display thing on the top of the keyboard feels unnecessary. I have it on a tray, so I don't see it. If I didn't, it would reflect the screen a bit\u2013 this wouldn't matter to me, personally, but I could see it irking some people.-The game mode button isn't labelled, so if you forget it's a thing, it can cause some confusion trying to change profiles.-If you're not paying attention, you can wind up hitting the topmost macro key when you're going for escape. This is a me problem, mostly.- iCUE has a function where you can save your bindings to the actual devices. If you're using a bunch of them, I have more than one mouse connected for example, it'll sometimes spring the \"do you want to update the profiles in iCUE?\" message on you when you open the program.CONCLUSION: Despite minor issues, I regret nothing. It's a really nice keyboard and pleasant to use; well worth the money.",
          "I got this to replace another midrange board with Cherry Blue switches (an older Trident). I thought Cherry Blue was my favorite switch, but opted to try the optical switches. Best. Choice. Ever. I game a lot, but also write and code a lot. This keyboard with the optical switches feels like the happy place between cherry blues and speed silver switches.It is glorious. If you don\u2019t need anvil press resistance for your typing this is the keyboard for you.My only gripe is the same gripe I have with my Corsair Scimitar mouse: every once in a while you have to unplug and replug it in. No idea why, but it every once in a while loses connection. Has happened about 8 times to my mouse since 2016, and only once on the keyboard so far. I just write it up to a quirk of their products at this point. But they are otherwise so flawless that even that doesn\u2019t detract from how great the keyboard is.",
          "I am on a computer like 16 hours a day, half that working, the other half gaming.  I type over 80wpm.  I've found this keyboard to be a bit too sensitive.  You can't rest your fingers on keys anymore without pressing them.  That may be better for gaming I guess, though I haven't found this improved my gaming experience whatsoever.  It also seems to accumulate gunk more than other keyboards.  The volume control is nice, but I absolutely hate having to install the razor software to get the lights/macro keys configurable.  Ridiculous you still need 3rd party software to do this after so many years.I can't see any real way this $100+ keyboard improves over a $20 one though.  LED's I guess, which are more of a pain and require task tray software.  More durable I guess but I've never had a keyboard be anything but durable.  The cable to it is super thick too, no idea why.",
          "So far I'm loving this keyboard. I've been a loyal Logitech fan for over two decades now and I gotta say it was a tough choice to switch brands after so long. I bought this to replace my G910 which had caps that had broken off and a few keys were starting to false trigger... lots of W's while typing, guess from all that gaming WASD pressing.Pros:These keys are pretty amazing. I got the MX Speed version and coming from Roamer G keys, they feel so much more responsive and I feel I can press them faster, they also feel sturdier, but that I can say about overall the keyboard itself. This aluminum body makes it feel solid. The wrist wrest is super comfy, I didn't know it was memory foam until I got it, you know it's one of those things I really didn't bother reading about while doing research. The texture on the key caps is also a nice detail. Volume wheel feels super sturdy too, same with the new Control Wheel.Cons:I'm not a super fan of their iCUE software. I was trying to setup some macros similar to how I had them on my G910 and spent like 5 mins trying to find how to set the name on one of the Actions I had just created... And then another 10 trying to find how to assign the action to one of the G keys... had to watch a video on their website to realize you have to click on the Action and then click on the Key... Guess I got used to the way it's done in the Logitech Gaming Software, which you either right click the key and have a context menu, or you drag and drop an existing Command to a key... a bit more intuitive and user friendly. The software itself feels a bit sluggish, but it's not something I'm going to spend on lots of hours on after I setup my macros and profiles. I do like that I pretty much have as many key assignments as Profiles I create, and also (haven't done it yet) but seems you can remap any key, which you couldn't do on the Logitech ones.",
          "UPDATED 2022-11-17:After using the keyboard for a few days, I'd say this is a pretty good keyboard.  I do not have any data on battery usage yet.The keyboard lighting effects are very nice and highly customizable.This being said the keyboard has a few areas for improvement:- unlike the other keys, the volume control wheel does not keep the keyboard alive.  So if you watch youtube videos for 15 minutes using only the mouse and the volume wheel, at some point the keyboard will go to sleep mode, and the volume wheel will stop working completely (until you press another key to wake up the keyboard).- it does not seem to be possible to assign a key to launch an application (say the Windows calculator) using the \"Hardware Key Assignments\".  This is possible using \"Key Assignments\" but this won't work if you use an A/B switch and your alternate computer is not running the iCUE software (unlike lighting effects which work in \"Hardware lighting\" mode). My old Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 could launch the Windows calculator from anywhere.- one major design issue which I initially thought was a bug:  if you save your lighting profiles using the iCUE software to the keyboard slots, it works but only as long as your keyboard is connected to the same computer.  If you use an A/B switch to toggle to a different computer, the keyboard does not retain its settings on that other computer.This is because the iCUE software is using different profiles if the keyboard is connected wirelessly or with the USB cable, but you cannot copy the wired profiles onto the wireless profiles.  You have to recreate them one by one.  Not a bug, but a major usability issue especially because the \"Lighting library\" is also not sharable between the wired profiles and the wireless profiles!- also if you use an A/B switch to toggle between two different computers, there is some lag for the keyboard to switch over (longer than what I had with my previous keyboard).- macro replaying seems to be real time.  So if you pause while recording the macro it will also replay the macro at the exact same slow speed. This may be good for games where timing is everything but not so much for software development. This is probably by design but it would be nice if this was configurable.Also, you have to be very careful about macro recording (don't do what I did by mistake to assign a macro to the Windows key, because the Windows lock key is also used to record macros!)- Keys are a little noisy (compared to a keyboard like the Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750)- The Shift keys are represented with an arrow pointing up to access characters showing at the bottom of the keys. This is unlike most keyboards and can be confusing.  Design blunder?- it is not clear if the on-board battery is replaceable, possibly reducing the keyboard longevity.  The keyboard appears to be locked sealed, without any screws.- Keyboard itself is entirely black. Style would greatly benefit to have a little white rim all around, similar to the Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750.In a minor note:- Product manual is downloadable via a QR code, but who has a QR code reader on a computer?- iCue software is 1.1GB to download- the predefined quick lighting zones in the iCue software are lacking. You have to create them (e.g, \"Function keys\", \"Numeric keypad\", etc...).- it would be nice if the keyboard could switch profile automatically based on the time of the day (i.e. to a different lighting when it is dark at night for instance)Overall it can be a nice addition to any computer, in spite of the high price tag, and the couple usability issues (fixable).  There is hope these will get addressed (including the macro recording timing and the volume control wheel) in a next software/firmware update...Note: I probably should get this keyboard for free in view of the QA work done for Corsair! What say you?",
          "Similar to alienware mechanical & msi gt77, but much smaller, more flexible.",
          "Because the index finger is injured, but my work requires a lot of typing. I have tried countless keyboards, and this one is the most comfortable and finger-friendly",
          "TL;DR - 10/10. Premium price, but premium quality in return.I will admit that I was a little hesitant about getting a wireless keyboard, mostly because of battery life and dropped connections. My job sometimes requires me to act quickly to fix an issue, and I was worried about the connection suddenly dropping when I was racing against the clock. I had a Corsair K70 and loved it, but it was getting old and had started acting up on me so I thought I would take a shot on this one. Oh boy, am I impressed. The keys feel incredible, the battery life is fantastic, and the connection is solid with no noticeable input delay. The \"Slipstream\" wireless receiver can pair multiple Corsair products as well, so you don't need to take up multiple ports if you like their product line.Pros:- Battery lasts me several days, working 8 hours a day and typically gaming or browsing for a few hours on top of that. I usually leave the RGB lighting on the highest brightness, so you could get even more life out of a single charge if you turn it down/off. I haven't checked charge time from 0-100%, but it charges fast enough that it doesn't matter to me personally.- The connection is solid. I'm about 10 feet from the dongle with my body, desk, and other equipment in between and have no noticeable input delay or dropped inputs.- The feel of the keys is amazing. I know this is more of a subjective matter, but I think they have just the right amount of \"click\" and feedback. They're a little less \"clicky\" than the Cherry MX Red switches that were in my K70, but still tactile enough to feel just right.- If you're also using a Corsair wireless mouse or headset, they can all pair with a single \"Slipsteam\" dongle so you're not taking up multiple USB ports with different receivers. I imagine this also cuts down on the interference that would be caused my having multiple wireless receivers next to each other?- Multiple connection modes - wireless, wired (while charging), and bluetooth with up to 3 pairings. Switching between connection modes is as easy as pressing FN+[corrosponding key].- Premium quality in every category that I can think of.Cons:- If you don't already have/use it, you'll need the Corsair iCue software to control many functions of the keyboard. I don't like having so many different pieces of software to control my system, but it's practically unavoidable. Luckily, iCue isn't one of those \"in your face\" pieces of software. It runs at startup without any popup or loading screen, and simply sits in your system tray until you need it.- Expensive, but you honestly get what you pay for.- That's it. I have no actual complaints, I love this thing.",
          "\u00a0I absolutely love this keyboard. Super comfy detachable palm rest, 6 macro keys, standard bottom row, double shot PBT keycaps, cool functional wheel, all in an overall clean and cool exterior.The rave's on about the high polling, but it also seems to have a minor effect on computer performance. I set mine for 2000 Hz, and on rhythm games, I'd like to think I can do slightly faster inputs, but I'm can't test for certain if it's all that noticeable.The OPX switches feel pretty nice, coming from a person who has been using Cherry Speed Silver switches on Corsair's K70 M.2 Low Profile for a few years. In part because I was so used to the flat feeling of a low profile keyboard, the typing experience took some getting used to. But, I shortly managed to match old speeds. All in all an excellent typing experience.The one thing that might ruin the typing experience, and the sole flaw that makes me want to consider returning the keyboard altogether, is this strange metallic pinging noise you get when pressing certain keys. There's still the satisfying clack/thok of the keyboard and that's all fine and dandy -- it's one of the reasons you buy me hanical keyboards. But for some keys (the . key in the video), it's accompanied by a metallic echoey sound, similar to if you were to strike a metal tool against a hard surface. I was hoping to replicate the keyboard ASMR that YouTube reviewers did with this keyboard, but the metallic ping ends up sounding like a gong -- once you hear it, it's really hard to ignore.I read that people have experienced this problem before with other Corsair keyboards, but at the same time, not many people are talking about it so... I don't know if people are ignoring it or if the keyboard I got was defective. Corsair improved on the stabilizers (especially the space bar, which sounds crisp btw) so it's clear they paid some attention to the sound of the keyboard. Still, it's pretty bad for a keyboard costing more than $200 to have this problem.If Corsair can fix that one problem, it'd basically be a perfect keyboard.",
          "Overall this seemed like a very nice keyboard. A month or so into using it though the keyboard seems to have a mind of its own. It will constantly trigger key inputs when it is not being touched. To remedy the situation I have to unplug the keyboard and plug it back it. This corrects the problem for an hour or two before it starts pressing keys on its own again. I figured, hey its optical so maybe dust or hair has gotten under the key caps and is triggering their input. Well even after cleaning this thing still has the same problem and the worst part is it seems to affect keys that are used the most. The keyboard literally typed my freaking password into my WoW chat on its own the other day. It really sucks when Im in the middle of a game and it starts wigging out causing me to take the steps to remedy it all while ruining my game play. EVERYTHING else about this keyboard is amazing but this flaw is massive and I just can not overlook it as it is a game killer and my PC is used 90% for gaming. Will be contacting Corsair about it to see if there is anything that can be done to resolve this"

          "this keyboard makes me like corsair even more because of its quality to afforability Ratio. it feels premium for its price. the key could be a alittle quieter and the hand rest that snaps on is a bit flimsy but you can take it off easily. other than that the g keys are great. just choose what software you want it to work with. icue and get mixed up with the hardware and elgato at the same time. also in gaming using key stroke can get you perma banned from servers so be-careful. I only mention this because this keyboard caters to gamers in general on a budge!!! the volume buttons have a nice push.MY wishes for this keyboard and Corsair in general - would be for the corsair Logo to light up or fade in n out white atleast Next For all corsair Wired keyboard  wires to always be high end and to feel premiums in terms of material used. not only that butLegs on keybords youd genrallyfeels super premium.lastly i wish the keyboard was non plastic but for the price its decent! i would pay anything over 45-50 for this keyboard.

          "I absolutely love this keyboard! I love everything rainbow, so when I came across this keyboard on sale, I showed my boyfriend and he told me that it\u2019s a really good brand and I should get it. So I did (lol). It has so many different light modes, I\u2019ll never get bored of them and I can be creative with the color combos! I keep it on the rainbow wave though, it matches the rainbow wave on my mouse. It makes the click clacks when you type, but it isn\u2019t overly loud. Boyfriend says it\u2019s a membrane keyboard, which means you can\u2019t switch out the key caps but I love it anyway.",

Otros teclados mas baratos se les borra las teclas con el tiempo este parece mas robusto y mas resistente.I bought this keyboard because I can't make noise in the house and personally I don't like it when they make noise either, it's quiet by my standards, I had a generic membrane keyboard and it makes a lot more noise than this one. It has good LED lighting, although it does not shine too brightly, it fulfills its function of being able to write easily at night by easily seeing the keys. It also has macros which I have not used yet. It has multimedia keys that are very appreciated to raise and lower the volume, pause music or video, mute all the system's audio etc, etc. In general happy with the keyboard for my needs is more than enough. Other cheaper keyboards will erase the keys over time this seems more robust and more resistant.",
          "I've had this keyboard for about 4 months now and it has proved quite resilient under heavy use. The keys and materials are all high quality (although I wish they were mechanical and not rubber dome, I guess you get what you pay for). The RGB is high quality and it's hard to notice when the lights switch to a different color (unlike some other keyboards I've had). All-around a solid choice for a budget keyboard",

          "I have been using standard keyboards my whole life (35 years) and this one is my favorite so far. The key clicking sound is so satisfying and the light up features are cool. I did change the lighting to just a soft white (download the software to do so) which has been a plus. (See attached picture) I didn't care for the rainbow effects. The F and J key home key bumps (nipples) are easy to feel for and help getting back to the home row quick... a huge plus for me. I do some gaming but I got this mostly for office work and I am 100% satisfied with what it does for me.The Macro keys are a godsend. I have all my favorite websites and apps tied to the macro keys significantly reducing time wasted clicking around my book marks and desktop icons. It saves about 6 seconds per website lookup with doesn't sound like much but it adds up after going to the same six resources over and over.If your an average person looking for an upgrade, this is a good choice. If your a super gamer, look at other reviews first before making your decision.",

However, RGB lighting software for the Corsair keyboard sucks. I have to reset the color settings every now and then after booting up the computer because the settings do not save all the time so it gets a little annoying.",

To do this you hold down the B and S buttons while you plug your keyboard into the PS5 ( some 10 year old kid posted this on youtube ).  If you do not do that the keyboard will not function at all.

          "Almost every keyboard I have ever bought has a slightly different layout.  The default keys are on the bottom of the key and the shift key is at the top.  Not so with this keyboard.  It must be made in a different country.  The number keys are weird and it took a little time to get used to.  The numbers, or the basic keystrokes are at the top of the keys the way they are printed on the keys.  Since the keys are slightly different in feel compared to my last keyboard I have to look at the keys to make sure I'm hitting the correct keys and the printing on the keys is very disorientating.  If I hit shift on my keyboard I expect it to represent the symbol or letter on the top of the key and no shift means small letters or whatever symbol is on the bottom of the key.  I thought all keyboards were laid out pretty much the same.  Apparently not.  The keyboard itself is fine and I like it and I'm sure I'll get used to it.  It's not a bad keyboard just the way the keys are printed are strange and yes you can change the layout but you should not have to change the layout to make it function as a standard keyboard.",

          "This is a solid gaming keyboard that let\u2019s you customize the background RGB lighting by zones. There are other more advanced keyboards that allow more customization but you pay substantially more for it. For my purposes this was great. It is wired via USB and therefore you never have to worry about batteries or bad wireless connection. The keyboard is very responsive and not too loud when typing. My only dislike is that apparently Corsair decided they wanted to redesign what an ampersand looks like, and the result is this strange symbol instead of the familiar \u201c&\u201d. Picture attached.",
          "In the pictures, they show you the white and the other colors look a lot more vibrant. Since the one I got has 5 zones, if I wanted to use only 3 of them which is only the keyboard you expect it to only show the colors there right? Well no. Since it's more of just a backlit then for each key there is a ton of color bleed into the other zones if you only choose specific ones. That's my only complaint but other than that this is a solid keyboard that will definitely last 2+ years. Since I'm not a big gamer I also use this keyboard to type essays for school and it's perfect for that. I also love the media buttons which feel premium. The keycaps are removable but I haven't got the courage to do it because it just feels like it will break off. I do recommend getting Corsair's more premium mechanical RGB keyboards since it will feel much better as the RGB is actually per-key lighting with almost no bleed.  For the value though it's perfect.",

          "This keyboard types very smoothly and quietly.  The lighting is decently configurable, not \"impressive,\" but definitely functional. I feel like the translucent part of the keycaps is too opaque, making the back-matte brighter than the keys (this is not a good thing). But other than that, very decent.Oh, and get rid of the stupid yellow dot in the middle of the wrist-rest.  I had to take it off with a black permanent marker because it's too distracting. And the Corsair logo doesn't really need to be right there either, if we're honest.But hey, for a $50 keyboard? Not bad.",
          "This keyboard is good quality and I'd recommend it for that. To control the lighting you need icue, and that is a pretty big software for just a keyboard. Anyway, the keyboard constantly will return to this flashing demo setup which is so annoying. A good example is if you restart your computer it'll do this. The way to fix that is to open icue. This seems to be a common issues and that's the solution people recommend. Since icue is used for various products they sell it's a pretty big software. Suddenly icue will stop working and you have to download the latest version of icue... just to stop the keyboard from entering this annoying flashing mode. It's quiet a bit of messing around to keep a keyboard from flashing obnoxiously constantly.",

However, it arrived in a plain brown cardboard box (as opposed to the yellow and black retail packaging) - there was no separate shipping box. A yellow cardboard insert from Corsair accompanied the keyboard.  The sealing label which kept box closed was already cut upon receipt.  Corsair is telling me all \u201cnew\u201d merchandise should be contained in retail packaging and that refurbished products will be packed in a plain brown box.  Unless I\u2019m missing something, I will be returning it I suppose.EDIT:  Ultimately decided to keep this keyboard as it looks like new and wound up using it for a different pc build than originally intended since I wanted a backlit keyboard (didn't really care about flashy RGB gamer stuff).  I have to admit, it is pretty nice even if it is a membrane board.  Icue software made it a breeze to set the desired lighting.  No complaints other than the possible refurbished issue which I'm still on the fence about.  Upgraded from 3 to 4 stars.",
          "It a good looking KB.  The quality feels good and has a usefull key layout for gaming.  Although I don't game much, the few times I've played I was satisfied.  I mostly do 3D and digital arts.  My keys set up is different than a gamers.  I guess my point is that it's worth the money.",
          "As the title says, this keyboard is perfect for the price. But don\u2019t let that make you think more money is better here; this keyboard did everything I wanted it to. My biggest problem with my old keyboard is that I couldn\u2019t see it in the dark. I like to use my computer in the dark and the LED fixed that completely for me. Although I am a sucker for LEDs and rainbow-y lighting, I can understand if the light is too distracting; this can be fixed with the brightness key though and even without LED this keyboard is worth the price. The keys feel so good to press and are so silent, at least compared to my old mechanical keyboard. The wrist pad is very nice too and does reduce strain for me, maybe even completely.5/5, I really don\u2019t see why anyone would want to waste money on a more expensive keyboard than this, unless you are going for wireless.",
          "I\u2019ve had it for 2 years now and no problems. It works great and is quieter. Still slightly loud if you\u2019re looking for a completely silent keyboard. BE AWARE IT DOES NOT WORK WITH I CUE SCENES. This means you can\u2019t sync it with other Corsair products. Otherwise great product wish it was slightly brighter.",
          "Simple comment: when I started to use it, I immediately realized this was the best keyboard I could have in this price range. All 5 stars without doubts.",
          "A great basic keyboard without a million extra features on it.",
          "Everything about the keyboard was great except for one small issue that was figured out in time",
          "In my opinion I suggest you go and by a mechanical one, I like the sound of the keys but if you don\u2019t maybe this is a good option, the keys on this one feels really cheep tho tbh",
          "The keyboard is fantastic. It just didn't come in it's original box and was late being delivered to me. Otherwise it would be a 5/5 star rating.",
          "This looks nice and the lights are bright but I don't like how the keys feel. There's no click or feedback and the keys feel soft. Once you're used to a mechanical keyboard it's hard to go to anything else. So I'll probably go back to a mechanical one.",
          "For those who don\u2019t know what key rollover is: key rollover is the maximum number of keys that can be pressed simultaneously while being guaranteed to register properly.  So a keyboard with 5 key rollover means any 5 keys can be pressed simultaneously and still work properly, however some 6 key combinations will not register properly when pushed simultaneously.This \u201cgaming\u201d keyboard only has 2 key rollover, so some 3 key combos simply don\u2019t work (a simple example being R, T, and Y).  This causes obvious issues while gaming.  For example, I cannot move forward, strafe to the right, and throw a grenade all at the same time.  This is completely unacceptable for any gaming keyboard.The keyboard is really only good for having RBG (if you like that kind of thing) and extra programmable buttons (for people who don\u2019t know how to use programs such as AHK).  It is not worth the money.  My Amazon basics keyboard from 6 years ago has 2 key rollover and only costed $8.P.S. The keyboard is often listed as having \u201c12 key selective rollover.\u201d  This is a made up term that,  means certain \u201ccommon\u201d keys are able to register when being pressed simultaneously.  So if you ONLY use the default keybinding for games you will probably be okay.  But a keyboard that doesn\u2019t work well with different keybinding isn\u2019t a gaming keyboard in my opinion.",
          "Very good k55 pro, i hope this dont fail in few days.",
          "Very good keyboard for touch typing.  I don't do much gaming, so this is what is important to me.What I did not like: 1) the instructions are microscopic and it took hours to find them.  (Turned out they are on the back of a cardboard image of the keyboard.)  2) The keyboard came with an annoying habit of flashing the lights and colors.  Took me awhile to find out how to defeat that \"feature.\"  3) I occasionally like to boot Linux from a thumb drive (in a USB port) which requires hitting the F12 key while the computer powers up, but apparently the F12 key does not work unless the computer is completely booted.",
          "El producto es muy bonito, me sorprendi\u00f3 bastante su est\u00e9tica y funcionalmente es un 10, ya que todos sus botones de comando me funcionaron perfectamente sin necesidad de instalar alg\u00fan programa de Corsair, Estoy bastante contento con la compra.",
          "Could be a little brighter",
          "I sampled and researched a number of mechanical switch keyboards and personally couldn't stand the clacking sounds they make, so this was a great alternative for me.  It feels very tactile and even has a satisfying response as the keys bottom out, but as a membrane keyboard it doesn't have that loud noise.The RGB options look nice after installing iCUE, and I like that it's easy to dim the lights from the keyboard itself (they tweak my eyes at full brightness at night with dim room lighting).  Volume and media controls on the top integrate seemlessly with Windows.I didn't initially think I'd use the palm rest, but once I started using it I now hate being at a keyboard without one.  More comfortable than it looks.My one complaint is the adjustment period it took to get used to the 'streaming commands' row of 'g' keys on the far left.  I can't say how many times I hit G1 instead of Esc, and I've yet to find a game that can map to them.  Maybe they're nice for streamers, and perhaps games will adapt for them in the future if they catch on (would be nice to have a row of left keys like these for hotbar actions or character selection in RPGs...).",

          "The first thing I noticed is almost zero \"click\" feeling from the keys. It doesn't have the mechanical keyboard feel at all and it is taking me a lot longer to get used to (typing is harder and harder to tell the threshold for a key being registered when pressed). I will probably give this away to a friend for free because I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is used to a mechanical keyboard. If you are building your first PC this is a great entry-level keyboard but something about just feels off to me. Overall 3/5 keyboard works fine",
          "",
          "I spent a lot of time researching gaming keyboards while trying to find something that would suit my needs for work too. When I came across this keyboard initially, I was skeptical since I thought I would prefer brown switches (quiet with a preference for a tactile bump); I had never used linear switches before, so although it felt like a risk, it TOTALLY paid off. This keyboard is insanely comfortable, quiet, and honestly looks amazing.- AESTHETICS: The RGB lighting is ridiculously saturated and the brushed aluminum finish provides such a clean look. I do like that there are onboard lighting modes/options since I can\u2019t download the customization software onto my work laptop (also a nice option for those whose work laptops use Linux since a lot of keyboard lighting software isn\u2019t compatible).- KEYCAPS: I appreciate that Corsair went with a cleaner font for the key caps (small detail, but to me it adds to the clean look of this keyboard). The key caps do leave some fingerprinting/residue behind on occasion, but to me it\u2019s never been very noticeable or bothersome.- PORTS: There is no USB or audio port built into the keyboard, for which I have to say at least a USB port would\u2019ve been nice (I imagine this would\u2019ve been tougher with the limitations of a low profile build, though).- LOW PROFILE BUILD & SWITCHES:  I will say that the low profile build, especially in this case with the Cherry MX low profile speed switches that have a smaller actuation distance than typical, may not be everyone\u2019s preference. I personally feel like the switches provide such a nice response and keep me from bottoming out, which is nice from an ergonomic standpoint. For others though, I can see that it might feel too sensitive and induce extra typos. It wasn\u2019t the case for me at all, and overall I would say this keyboard totally met all of my needs.",
          "Really like this keyboard. The key press does have a different feel that takes some getting used to, which some people might not like, but to me it was just a matter of adjusting. The lighting is incredible! It\u2019s exactly what I wanted and now I wish I had bought all Corsair products to start with. iCue is by far the best lighting software I\u2019ve used.For those complaining of double-inputs from the keys, this is called \u201cKey-Chatter\u201d and is very common with mechanical switches. It is usually easily remedied by cleaning the switch out with rubbing alcohol. Of course, unplug first, remove the keycap and squeeze a good amount of alcohol down into the switch with a qtip and rapidly press the key. Dry it out with canned air and should be good to go!",
          "A few years ago I bought a K95 Platinum keyboard that was easily 3x the price of this keyboard and I kinda like this one better with one caveat.The switch springs are stiffer than most mechanical keyboards and this has lead to a light touch from me so sometimes I get no engagement or too much to where the keys repeat themselves.Aluminum body is sturdy and easy to cleanNo dedicated media or macros but FN combo keys and not missing those from my old keyboard.",
          "I'm not a gamer but like to work in low light.  I wanted a per key lit keyboard and this one was one of a few available for a decent price.  Warning: the keys are VERY sensitive with some of the problems others have mentioned here (double strikes, keys next to each other showing up when you've for sure only hit one, also the keys are not quiet, especially the space bar.  I'll try this for a while and maybe have to look elsewhere.  But the keys are per-key and that was a prime purchase decision.",
          "The product arrived earlier than expected, well packaged and of excellent material.",
          "Su tacto es muy bueno, tiene una iluminaci\u00f3n potente y configurable, la almohadilla es muy suave y en general se siente muy bien.",
          "overall a decent mechanical rgb keyboard.  I have a logitech  G915 for comparison and i've come from ergonomic keyboards like Microsoft 4000 and Sculpt, and logitech ERGO K860. The buttons on the Corsair as not quite as \"crisp\" as the logitech but decent. I wonder if that is by design of the cherry mx keys to make them less klakier. though my G915 is a traditional layout, i.e. non ergonomic, i had no issues. but on the Corsair i feel discomfort on my shoulders and right hand wrist (below the thumb). unsure if this is just a getting used to thing though again on the g915, no issues. this makes me suspect further its a tad narrower from a layout perspective and the keys feel a tad smalleralso and could be good or bad, the keys are pretty sensitive. unsure if a break-in thing. it hardly takes pressure before it types something up. so one can't quite rest the fingers on it. time will tell I guess.great value for the money for sure. it does look nice with the brush aluminum look.",
          "I should note it took me almost a month for me to like it.  My muscle memory was tied into that other keyboard I had for five years.  I wouldn't now go back to the older one.",
          "The keyboard has a lloud tinny sound, especially on the spacebar, but the hand rest is really high quality and I liiked it enough to keep it in general. Then literally the day after my return window ended it started randomly typing extra llelters for no reason - most specifically L's and I's. You'll see it in this post, and I'm intentionally not editing them. I tried restarting the PC, unpllugging and plugging back in the keyboard, uninstalling and reinstalling iCUE, resetting the keyboard by holding ESC before pllugging back in, but nothing works.So.. I llove the LED features and profiles. The build quality is fine especially if you get the keyboard on sale. But if you can onlly count on it for 2 months of use, I wouldn't bother and I'd buy something else instead.",
          "I've had the K60 RGB Pro keyboard for about a week now and wanted to posted some initial thoughts. I was looking for a keyboard that was 1) affordable, 2) had just the right about of feedback, and 3) had cool lights. The K60 RGB Pro fits the bill in all three areas.The keyboard is significantly less than other similar brand-name mechanical keyboards but is still made with high-quality components. The feedback is perfect for me. My previous keyboard was a Razer Deathstalker with chiclet keys. I found that I needed more tactile feedback than that style provides. The K60 RGB Pro does not disappoint. Lastly, the lighting is exactly what I was looking for. You do have to install the built-in Corsair software to get the full functionality but, once you do, there are dozens of pre-set lighting styles you can choose from and the ability to create new custom ones as well.I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone look for the right balance of price, feel, and lighting. I plan to update my review after a few months to see how it ages.",
          "I have a K70 on my main computer. It's much better. However, this is one third the price. The keys felt strange compared to the cherry reds I am used to at first, but I got used to it. These are quieter and work well for productivity with gaming as well. Overall, if you are on a budget, out like me just needed something for my kids, this is a great keyboard.",
          "Had  two keys  so far with chatter problems repeating r and  g keys. Corsiar seems to not give good  support on this",
          "Can\u2019t beat it for the price.",
          "It's built so well and works good with iCUE but it isn't really \"low profile\".",
          "Overall, I have loved this keyboard. I don't use it that much, which is why I am upset. I work from home maybe once a month, I got this keyboard mainly for the PBT keys, but they don't seem to be holding up nearly as well as the ones at my work. Not very happy with it because I type on the ones at work 10X more than this. The lights on this are cool though.",
          "I started playing Mech Arena online.  My regular keyboard had the W key sticking which was how you moved forward.  So I was looking for a gaming keyboard.  The Corsair K60 RGB keyboard is great as your first gaming keyboard.The good: Full size and 104 keys which includes the number keypad.  I use this also for office work.  I do not understand the allure of a small tiny keyboard.  Sturdy materials.  No loud mechanical keys.  Customizable with iCUE software (free download).  For me I wanted to have the main Mech Arena game keys all 1 color.  It took me a Youtube to figure it out but I did and it works great.  You do not have to leave the software running once you set it up.The bad:  media keys are function keys.  I would had preferred separate media keys and a volume knob.The ugly: I keep hitting the caps key as it is next to the 'A' key which is a move left button on my game.  No wrist pad.  iCUE software is not intuitive, but there are Youtubes you can use to help you.Summary: For $50  you get a sturdy, customizable gaming keyboard suitable for the office.  You could pay $150 or more for the top of the line, but this works just fine.",
          "I got this in May and within about 2 months or less, the 'P' key started to double type, once when pressed down and once when lifted. It has been noticeable when typing slow but will happen with a quick tap. That starts happening then about 2 weeks later, the stem of the 'D' key snapped and I had to glue it back together which kept it working. I just now am trying to send it out for an RMA which I will be without my good keyboard for probably over a week, maybe more since this always takes forever.Sadly, when the keyboard works fine with no issues, it is a great one. Keys feel very good, very short activation point but the Viola switches feel nice. Definitely worth it just beware since Corsair seems to have really been lacking lately in the QA department. I have had about 5 products from them now that just don't work properly and it is incredibly annoying and I don't think I will be buying anything from them due to the lack of good quality over a period of time.",
          "Spacebar continuously double spaces when I only press once. I contacted the support team, they showed me how to 'reset' the keyboard and even that didn't work. I might be wrong on this one but the keyboard also did not come with a wrist rest but I'm not sure if it is supposed to or not. Other than those two problems it is a good keyboard, buy with caution.",
          "The keys on this particular model of keyboard are extremely sensitive to touch, I've had to disable the context menu key and the windows key because of this. However, this is a fantastic keyboard so far.The keys feel great, responsive, and even though it's marketed as a \"quiet\" keyboard, it does have a nice clicking sound while typing because I bottom the keys out.Pros:Responsive, well built switches.Keys feel very nice under the fingertips while typing, pretty natural sensations.Rock solid construction, it's got some heft to it and feels pretty durable.Backlighting is second to none, it's bright, colorful and is appealing.Cons:Sensitivity is off the charts, lightly grazing a key while typing can cause mis-strokes almost immediately, this keyboard is not for touch typing.iCue software takes up over a gig in space.Will probably update this review in a few weeks to share more feedback once I've gotten used to it.",
          "Update after a month of use for typing and programming:When it comes to typing and other textual documentation, I like the the apple keyboard since, that's much faster as there is little movement of fingers required.However when it comes to coding, since one would be pressing multiple (combination keys) at once, a lot; mac keyboard fails here as it's hard to hit the keys right without looking at the keyboard.  Membrane keyboards better but the mechanical keyboards the best since one can feel the keys the best without accidentally pressing them.I liked the brown keys keyboard that I used earlier, the good this with this particular K60 from Corsair is, it's a lot silent than the cherry mx keys, so I can enjoy my music playing on the desktop speakers while typing.Only thing that I didn't like that much on this keyboard is, the actuation distance is very short, like 1mm, which is apt for gaming for typing, when I rest keys, I need to ensure that I don't press the keys accidentally (there is not tactile for actuation). I kind of got used to it.Below is the recommendation:Not recommended if you- like clicky sound- use this for typing AND have heavy handsRecommended if you- like more silent keyboard (as silent as a membrane keyboard)- quick actuation (gaming/ arrow key navigation etc)- for coding and do not have heavy fingers (so you avoid accidental actuation)- for typing and  do not have heavy fingers- like funky full-color back lights (this keyboard has best back-lighting)The space-bar was noisy, I noticed this is happening at the time of releasing the key fast, the momentum of the space bar hitting the pasting limiter/stoppers on the top. I fixed it by pasting some petroleum jelly between the metal supporters and plastic groves/limiter that are on the either ends of the space-bars, and not to the mechanical transparent switch.  Now the space bar is as pleasant as the \"enter\" key.Hardening silicone gel is another option, but I couldn't locate that on time. If you use silicone, you need to be super precise with it as you don't want to obstruct the motion of the keys with hardened silicone.I am getting one more of K60 RGB Pro SE for my 5th grader daughter, cuz I like this keyboard for my needs and she likes it too bumping up to 5 star.I can provide pictures.------------------Update after a week of heavy use:This *sounds* more pleasing than the brown keys. Keys still feel harder to bottom out (I know keys don't change but I can get used to it). The actuation point is roughly at 1mm, so there is no need to bottom out the keys except for a sense of satisfaction.Still keeping 4 stars.  Would upgrade to 5 stars when/if this becomes my go to keyboard and when I start recommending to my friends.  Currently I still recommend a keyboard with \"brown keys\" for typing use.Original Review:Cherry MV (MX Viola) Keys (transparent ones) - not blue, brown, red. Feels like a variant of MX Red. Should be better than MX Red when it comes to gaming.This keyboard was a total surprise to me, in a good way and a bad way both.Softer than expected.Heavier than expected.Colors look cooler than expected.Space bar more wiggly and noisy than expected.Quality of material, better than expected.Ergo - rather a flat keyboard - not as expected.Wrist pad ---  integrated magnetic wrist pad is better than an independent one.Hopefully I will get used to it soon.This is a next level of engineering, I don't know if the effect is good or bad, so far so go. Will update the review after a few 1000s of lines of code.",
          "The keyboard I received is great. When I got it, the box was nearly demolished, and the shipping label was mostly gone. Most likely USPS doing. Apart from that, it\u2019s a definitely good keyboard for a budget!",
          "The form factor is definitely smaller than I\u2019m used to, but the style is great. I\u2019ve never used cherry caps before this purchase, and I\u2019m still getting used to how sensitive they are compared to my older keyboard, which causes a few typos and accidental keystrokes while gaming occasionally, but that\u2019s all on me, the user. It\u2019s a fantastic keyboard!",
          "Great keyboard and very quiet. Not very much to say but I also have the Royal Kluge and both the boards are easily winners. The only cons is that sometimes when you likely rest or slightly touch the keys it press that key. Other than that, I can say if you are in for a gaming keyboard and this is the right price, buy it. RGB looks amazing as well and very bright.",
          "I have issues with the spacebar. There are a lot of times that the spacebar will double click and it will put multiple spaces in a sentence. Things got better the more I wore the spacebar out, but it is very very sensitive and very annoying at first.",
          "its decent i use it often! the material is quite interesting i dont know how to describe it! the sound of it is okay!!",
          "I LOVE this keyboard. I was looking for something that would work with my long acrylics. it's so comfy and easy to use. I've had zero issues with it. The lights are so fun and customizable and key input is that of super high end keyboards.",
          "So, I've been using this for about a week or two. Don't get me wrong, it's really cool. The ability to use ICUE to change the colors and such is really neat, though admittedly, it's kind of limited on how much you can do. It has good variety but most the options feel rather lackluster in terms of customization. I could ignore all of that though, that isn't really the problem.I don't really review things often, but I was just typing on this and noticed this weird ringing noise it makes when I type. Maybe I type too hard, but the ringing noise is hard to ignore and is slightly annoying. It's the perfect amount of volume to sort of irritate you. I'm not complaining about the volume of the button pressing, I mean, I got a mechanical keyboard for a reason. If you are working in an office and expecting a quiet keyboard, never get a mechanical keyboard or you are absolutely dense. The ringing noise is just not a feature that I care for much, and the semi-limited customization is kind of sad.The upsides are though that the keyboard is nicely sized, the buttons feel nice to press (at least for me). It comes with a numpad as well, and for a mechanical keyboard, sometimes only the higher ends one come with a numpad. There's customizable keybinding allowing you to bind some keys to create actions which is really neat but I haven't touched much upon that. This keyboard generally for the price is recommendable. Razer keyboards aren't really that trusty or quality anymore, so finding a good keyboard like this is rather rare.It's worth the purchase if you're hunting for a mechanical keyboard, but if you're looking for a quiet or simple keyboard, you're best off looking elsewhere. Keyboards don't have to be expensive to last, but the god feeling quality of a good one is never without a price above 50$ unless you're knocking off a numpad and extra regular keyboard features.",
          "Didn\u2019t like the feeling at beginning, always mistyped cuz the keys are so sensitive. After using it for a month I finally can get the feeling of this keyboard and it does type very fast. One caveat is that some keycaps are labeled upside down, like the { [. If I turn it 180 degrees and put back, it doesn\u2019t fit with the floating style around it",
          "GENERAL INFORMATIONComing in at a very low budget keyboard, the K60 performs similarly to competitors, with some changes scattered around.PROS- Per-key RGB lighting control with iCUE. Also allows it to sync with lighting in your PC, if applicable!- Good mechanical keyboard feel and sound (with an exception - con #1) that doesn\u2019t break the bank.CONS- Audible metal base. When you click a key hard enough, you can notice a metal sounding reflection of the sound. It\u2019s definitely hollow in there!- Hand/wrist support not included.CONCLUSIONI love my K60. It\u2019s a great mechanical keyboard from a name-brand group. If you were on a tight budget, you could get away with a cheaper one, but this is a great entry-level gaming keyboard from a big brand.",
          "So coming from my favorite keyboards, scissors and low profile membrane, my first try on another mechanical gaming keyboard was disappointing.  The key travel was very long, the keys were super springy, and it felt like typing on a trampoline.  I hated it, and almost just gave up trying to make one work.  That is where this keyboard comes in.I love the short key travel, the low profile keys, and how it feels.  Gaming on it is now effortless and feels totally natural.  I'm getting more control than I had on membrane while keeping the great feel.  Takes a little getting used to, because the keys are sensitive so when you first start out you will likely get some mistyped keys, but that fades quickly.  Once you get used to it, you can almost float your fingers on it without bottoming it out.  I use this on the couch in my lap, and it is perfect for what I need it for.The RGB is very nice.  Bright, and so much customization.  Sky is the limit here, so you can get very creative.  No complaints here at all.I did get a \"used - very good\" version first, which was not very good but was indeed damaged, likely a factory defect.  The deck was dented and some keys were cracked without any other signs of damage, not something someone could do on their own.  Returned and got a brand new one, and all is well.In summary, if you like short key travel sensitive keyboards with a great feel, you will like this.  Price was great too ;)",
          "Been using this keyboard for nearly 2 years, it is a great keyboard at the start but over time the key caps come off really easy ( specifically the ones on the outer edges) have lost the cap lock and left shift many times. keeping it clean is hard, I keep blowing out and replacing they keys when they blow offf and deal with some keys ( 'f' in particular) double or even triple striking.With some quality control and easy tweaking this could be a world class keyboard, however, as is it  is merely good",
          "I got this because I broke my k95 keyboard. I wanted to replace it but wasn't willing to shell out $200 again. I compromised by buying the k60 but I absolutely love it. Its smaller for sure - the k95 in comparison is bulky and has a wrist pad which is nice for a larger desk with more space. I have a very compact desk so I much prefer the k60, plus I really appreciate the minimalistic approach.You get the keys you expect and any 'extra' functions are tied to using the FN  button along with pressing the corresponding function key. For example to mute you press FN and F5 (there's an icon on the F5 key). I do miss the k95 having a volume bar and mute button that you can access with one press - but it's a trade off of size vs extra buttons.  The keyboard feels great to use and feels like it's made of quality materials.If you have a larger desk, want extra buttons, and have $200 for an RGB keyboard go with the K95. If you want a standard size keyboard that looks really sharp go with the K60. The iCue software lets you customize the layout/colors on your PC.",
          "I own a lot of keyboards, searching for the best one for me (a lot of gaming). I didn't set out to be a collector, but I think I've turned into one! The Cherry MX Sliver (\"speed\") mechanical switches this 'board uses are very fast, with an actuation point about half the distance of other keys I've used. Very speedy. It took me about two weeks getting thoroughly used to it, as it only requires a very light touch compared to my other mechanical keyboards (and definitely membrane 'boards, which I cannot go back to after using mechanical switches). My gaming (as well as my typing) has noticeably improved after acclimating to the light touch. All the usual Corsair per-key and pattern RGB customization and sturdy aluminum frame are here as well.These switches are linear, like (light) MX Reds, so no bump or clacking like Browns or Blues. I used to favor the MX Browns for their tactile (though not noisy) feedback. But with these MX Silvers, by the time I would normally just get to the beginning of the Brown's bump, the Silvers have already actuated and bottomed out! So quick I found that tactile feedback was superfluous. Double shot PBT key caps, too, so characters will not rub off over time. Did I mention that I love this keyboard?One thing to point out for prospective buyers: because it is low-profile it doesn't come with a wrist rest (perhaps Corsair figured it was not needed.) But I like one, so I got a Glorious padded wrist rest here: (https://smile.amazon.com/Glorious-Gaming-Wrist-Pad-Rest/dp/B0191YRMCO/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=glorious+wrist+rest&qid=1659822706&sprefix=glorious+wrist+%2Caps%2C223&sr=8-5) Though there are cheaper wrist rests here on Amazon, I love the lasting quality of Glorious gaming gear.(I do not work for Corsair, Cherry, or Glorious. These are just my personal opinions, so take that for what it's worth.)",
          "K70 cable wore out where it is internally mounted to the chassis(opening and repairing isn't fun with these. not easy to open in general). Got this as a replacement. Super happy so far. I needed a replacement keyboard with similar key height for gaming and such. I'm a weirdo who uses their palm to press ctrlMight update in a month or so",
          "I bought this keyboard a year ago to go with a new PC I put together. It's got RGB lights (the colors are a bit too far on the pastel side for my liking) and customizable buttons (I changed F1, Scroll Lock, Pause Break, and Insert) which can be changed via Corsair's iCue software. The keycaps are really thin, and can pop off if you flick your finger off the side of the key while typing.After about 9 months it started registering more key presses than I input (e.g. I press \"w\" once and more than one \"w\" are typed). It was just the \"w\" key. Pretty annoying, but I was just working around it. Then other keys started doing it too. Resetting my PC only changed the keys that would do it. Corsair's website says unplug the keyboard and plug it back in while holding the escape key for 5 seconds to reset the keyboard. That didn't resolve the issue in any way. Then the Right Shift key stopped working 100 percent of the time (it works some of the time I press it but not every time). Then the #5 key stopped working completely. That's when I submitted a ticket with Corsair for a warranty replacement for a faulty device.",
          "My son needed a new keyboard and we did a lot of searching before he decided on this one. He was so happy with it that it earned me an unprovoked thank you and hug a day after it arrived. Considering he\u2019s 17 I was very amused he was so happy.Then the space bar started double spacing a few days ago randomly. Made Minecraft a little difficult but he was trying to find ways to make it work.Then it started constantly double and triple spacing with the lightest of touches.We had no choice but to return it. Currently most of his set up is Razer so he decided to give them a try instead of replacing this with the exact same thing again.Hopefully you have better luck because it apparently was amazing for a while.",
          "I used the key board for office And gaming. I have had it since august 2021, its now October 2022, and the WASD is broken- as well as the Q and E key re now starting to go. As a gaming Keyboard it fails at its job for durability. Those keys NEED to last. I paid WAY too much for this thing, and DIDNT GET the warranty because all my other gaming items have lasted for EVER! and taken ABUSE-unlike this keyboard. I babied the keyboard and it still broke. All my other gaming items aren't corsair, and that might be why the are 4 and 5 years old with no issues. DO NOT Purchase!",
          "Love the boars works well very quiet and rgb works great",
          "Very light weight, feels cheap but also sturdy at the same time, its an odd feeling. Sits perfect on the desk no movement. The keys feel very weird to type on, they are MX speed so not clicky & if they did click I swear that would make it feel way more out of place, its the low profile that makes it feel weird. The keycaps are fine, they shine more over time. Key input is very responsive, I cannot stress this enough input is lightning fast & easy to game with. Lot of LED color options, has a thin USB 3.0 or higher cable which is hardwired! no USB pass through. Perfect for competitive gaming, but ever user has different opinions & needs for these things.Issues:I ran into with this keyboard Randomly not working on my PC. Turns out the keyboard can remember devices it has been plugged into or tested on in the past causing issues due to the lack of a bios setting switch. Anyway to fix unplug it, Hold the Escape key then plug it back in while still holding the Escape key for about 2 seconds, you'll see the keyboard react so you will know when , Then release the escape key & No more problems. But just in case download & run Corsair Ique & update firmware or Reflash the firmware.Edit/Update: If you change the RBG & still get the issue during start up, do the above method to get it working, pick the lighting profile you want because you will be stuck with it, Unplug keyboard & hold S+B, now plug it back in while still holding S+B. All the lights should light up, this is bios mode & should fix that problem of it not being recognized during start up.To change the lighting after this Do the Esc method, pick new lighting, then do the S+B method again.This is actually all in the manual it just doesn't say its for fixing this specific issue! So if you run into this issue, now you know!Overall cost, performance & features. I highly recommend this keyboard in 2022.",
          "I'm going to start off by saying, this keyboard is absolutely gorgeous. The lights are bright and clear, and the ICUE software gives you a ton of configuration options.This was the first mechanical keyboard I bought, so I was excited to feel just how heavy and sturdy it felt when I opened the box. The brushed aluminum feels premium, but can be a bit difficult to clean at times.Now, my main problem with this keyboard is the use of Cherry Viola switches. They are not hot-swappable, so I couldn't do anything when the keys started chattering after a few months of use.On top of not being able to swap them out, the switches felt very mushy. There were plenty of times where I rested my hand gently on the keyboard, and pressed a key I didn't mean to press.I personally found the experience with this keyboard to be subpar, and will not be buying another, despite how pretty it was.",
          "This year, I decided to switch to a gaming PC rather than using my laptop over the past few years, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the quality of this keyboard. The feel is nice, the build is sturdy, and the lighting options out the box are impeccable. Typing on this keyboard is a breeze, and it suits my feel of Low Profile, due to its subdued almost tacky sound with each keystroke; I prefer that compared to a louder clacky sound on my keyboard. My only gripe with this product, is that the keycaps aren\u2019t as customizable, but that isn\u2019t much of an issue because I am not looking to break the bank on my keyboard. But if you need a good priced, good value, beautiful keyboard that\u2019s good to go out the box, this will definitely be my recommended go to for all my friends entering the PC world of gaming.",
          "Works fine, had a bit of issue getting it to connect at first but got it working. The edges are very sharp, the keys will sometimes press multiple as if stuck together somehow, even straight out of the box. 100% needs a wrist wrest to go along with it, it's not comfortable to use at all without one.",
          "S\u00faper a tiempo la entrega, todo bien sellado y con sus medidas de seguridad, el producto fiel a las fotos y videos de YouTube, s\u00faper feliz con el, el price y esta muy asequible y muy por debajo de muchas otras tiendas m encant\u00f3",
          "My son says the build quality is very good. The name brand Cherry key are a plus. Low profile. Good lighting.",
          "I was expecting a very clicky mechanical keyboard. This one is a little quiet, but different than I was thinking. I have gotten used to the tactile response, but since they are cherry mx switches, I was expecting a certain feel. These switches on this keyboard are different than what I was used to. More responsive, seem to make more typing mistakes, but overall the keyboard performs and works pretty well.",
          "This keyboard is very well made especially for the money spent. I would say that corsair did a good job on this one. I did buy this used, so it was a little bit dinged up when I got it, and pretty dirty. But after a thorough cleaning and minor repair, its working great. (I did expect something like this when buying it used) I really like the feeling that this keyboard has when typing, and I love the sound it has. Pretty good quality over all, and would totally recommend to anyone looking to buy a nice, but not super pricey gaming keyboard.",
          "Wish it had an external switch to turn off RGB so I did not have to run their software adding more burden to the OS!",
          "Decent build quality, not loud keys (kinda chatty but not loud vs standard cherry reds), low profile keys (not very many options for low profile keyboards that's mechanical), with good RGB lighting.No physical media keys and there is a slight learning curve as the feel is slightly.... springy? squishy? and sensitive so might press a key too fast.my left ctrl key is meh, playing FPS games it's usually binded for crouch, if it's not toggle based even though you're pressing it, you're character stands up. Kinda annoying and idk if it's the keyboard or the game.As a long time logitech consumer and being disappointed with their recent keyboards. This is nice without the premium price tag. Idk  yet about durability but my logitech boards had a couple of keys that died.Software is better than logitech (or razer, won't get anything that force installs software) and I don't need it to use it.",
          "I am absolutely amazed at the color patterns that can be created with this keyboard! But if you have adhd it can be distracting during fps games lol."

        "name": "Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Speed RGB Silver, Black (CH-9127414-NA)",
        "rating": 4.7,
        "reviews": [
          "WOW! What an amazing keyboard, I upgraded from a Logitech G610 and the difference is night and day, the keys are incredibly responsive on this keyboard and the quality is amazing. I feel like I could throw this keyboard off of a building and all of the keys would still work like it was brand new. RGB looks great on this platform and is very easy to edit through the ICUE software. The reason I am giving this product a 4 star review instead of 5 stars is because the keys have a very noticeable metallic ringing sound to them, which you can't hear while gaming but if you are just casually typing or doing homework it could get pretty annoying to listen to. The sound doesn't really bother me anymore though since I mostly just us my pc for gaming. But I believe they do make a quieter version with different keys. I would definitely recommend this keyboard or any other Corsair keyboard tbh as they are an amazing brand name and I have been nothing but impressed with their products so far.",
          "So this is primarily a review of the MX Cherry blue switches on this keyboard. The keyboard itself is amazing; it's well built, the RGB is bright and vibrant and the software isn't nearly as bad as others would lead you to believe. The only downside I had are the macro keys on the left. If you are used to hitting the ESC or CTRL key without looking, you might find yourself hitting these keys by accident. They were more of a nuisance than a benefit for me, thus the 4 star rating.The MX Blue switches however... you think you want them, but you don't. Or, that was my case. After a while, the clickyness got tiresome and annoying. The keyboard just sounded \"crunchy\" and cheap after a while. Do yourself a favor, and purchase a key switch tester. There are just too many options and you really need to feel them and hear them for yourself to get an idea for what switch works for you. I ended up going the exact opposite route with a Corsair Strafe with the MX Cherry Red silent switches and I am loving it so far. It turns out linear switches were my preference the entire time. And the softness of the Red silents are more my style.",
          "Corsair is definitely my prefered brand for many things, including their reliable power supplies, of which I own over 5 or 6. However, in contrast to their long lasting & reliable power supplies, the K95 Platinum XT has not gone the distance.At first blush, the keyboard has everything you could ask for - solid build quality, plush wrist wrap, excellent lighting, and easy-access macro / media buttons to meet all my needs for convenience. It was also my first foray into using Cherry MX Browns, which (in my opinion) are far superior to competitive tactile switches (such as those in the Logitech K845) or, more obviously, membrane keyboards (like the Logitech MX Keys). My initial appreciation of the board quality and functionality of the board on day 1 would have net the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT 5/5 stars.Day 2 is when the relationship soured a bit - unfortunately, the keyboard seems to only work on machines on which you have Admin access (such as a personal computer). Because I spend more time working than gaming, I decided to enjoy the premium experience on my work computer instead of my gaming machine. This would prove impossible, as the keyboard requires installation of a bunch of drivers and, I suspect, the iCue software, which is not possible on my company-owned and secured machine. Because of the allure of the Cherry MX Brown typing experience, I quickly bought a Logitech K845 with its Brown switch competitors, only to be disapointed with the Logitech in comparison with the Corsair. Not Corsair's fault, but something to be cognizant of.However, 1.5 years after my purchase, the relationship has finally come near an end, as the Corsair keyboard will randomly require me to unplug / replug it into my motherboard due to unspecified \"mechanical failures\" (per Windows), usually once a day at random intervals. Due to this, from time to time, I am either forced to get up and reach around my rig and fiddle with the wires, or in a pinch, swap out the keyboard entirely and borrow the inferior-keyed Logitech K845 and transplant it to my personal computer. I will certainly miss it, but this was a good experience to learn that I should economize on fancy RGB options based on the possibility of not being able to use the keyboard in a plug-n-play manner.Pros-Solid aluminum construction-Faux-leather wrist rest-Genuine Cherry MX Browns-Media buttons-RGB Customizability-Pleasure to type on-No observable deck flex over 1.5 years-No shame in being a Corsair fanboy/fangirlCons:-Can't use on locked-down company machines-Only lasted 1.5 years (surprising given premium price)-Annoyingly heavy braided cable connecting to computer",
          "I've had this exact model keyboard (Blue switch) since January of 2020 and it's still in fantastic shape. Absolutely no fade or wear on any keys. Just as responsive. All the LEDs still illuminate in pretty colors. Honestly couldn't ask for a better keyboard for myself.After about 2 years the wrist rest padding started to tear and lost the outer covering,  revealing the plain foam underneath. Its a mild annoyance appearance wise but it did take quite a long time before it happened.I'm happy to report the current price of $136 is what I paid in 2020 as well. Keep it up Corsair! May your flag never fall!",
          "While I do not have any issue with MX Blue switches being louder than Brown, the spacebar and other large keys seems louder than I'd prefer. It's a small issue which can be fixed via modding. But that also means getting into the gut of the keyboard do that modding yourself. I'll eventually do that at some point. But it is something to consider or keep in mind when shopping. The macro keys on the side is a good bonus but I have yet to find a particular macro script to bind it for. Hitting the Esc key proved to be tricky, as I continually hit the top macro key by accident. This is a learning experience and for now, I have set that macro key as a Esc key. Custom lighting effect is nice and I am able to set it in a nice way that changes depending on game. The volume knob is a bit stiff and is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, it makes accidental volume adjustment harder. But when I do need to adjust the volume, it can be a bit of a bother. For the main typing keys, I used two O-rings for dampening. The rest uses one O-ring. Overall, I like it. It is on the expensive side. But here's to hoping this keyboard will last me a good 10 years.",
          "I finally made a jump over to a mechanical keyboard and all I can say is that sound, WOW. I find myself looking for things to type just to feel, hear, and look at this beast of a board. I've used the G11 before this for about 10 years. I love that thing to death but I needed an upgrade. In comes the Corsair K95 Platinum XT with brown switches. This is a more than worthy successor and I wanted to touch on a few topics that I didn't see answered in my own research.Streaming:Are the brown Switches too loud for Streaming? Yes or No? I'd have to say that by itself it can bleed into the microphone; it is, after all, a mechanical keyboard.  Here's the thing the switch itself (browns) are silent. The issue is the sound that comes from the keycaps hitting the chassis. So even if you went REDS or Silent you'd still get the sound of the keycap bottoming out. So what\u2019s the Solution? I got you fam, get a set of o-rings both red and blue. It helps quite a bit, it's not a miracle product though so don't expect no sound at all. On areas where the keyboard is still too loud, and you\u2019ll find those spots, double up on the o-rings.Recording:Now, this tip can go up on Streaming as well but I wanted to separate it. Ok so you have your keyboard, you have your o-rings, but the sound is still coming through, what now? If you use OBS/Streamlabs, which it's highly likely, add a noise gate. Mess with your own settings I'd recommend getting reapers VST and adding that noise gate. Don't add Noise Suppression though it will kill your voice. Noise Suppression eliminates all unwanted sound yes but at the cost of sounding like an unnatural dumb dumb. With recording it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll get more noticeable bleed through the microphone but there\u2019s some good news. THE GAME MUSIC. Game music does a really good job of hiding those really low clicks. When you\u2019re mixing make sure the in-game music or music you add is just slightly under your voice and BOOM keyboard be gone. It\u2019s there but it should go unnoticed.With that said this keyboard is like others have said the Rolls-Royce of keyboards. It\u2019s gorgeous, sounds satisfying, and the keycaps feel amazing with the upgraded textured top of the keycap. The previous model didn\u2019t come with the upgraded caps.I hope I could help at least a little, happy clicky clacks!(PS. The majority of people prefer the sound of the keyboard in live streams as long as it\u2019s not louder than the streamer)",
          "Everything about this keyboard is outstanding. I love how fast the key inputs are with how much less click sound is great. Late night gaming is best and if the lighting effect is distracting you, you can simply lower the lights/turn it off with a button on the keyboard. Volume control is easy and I'm very impressed with how smooth and silent it is. Love this keyboard to the moon and back.",
          "One online review I read called the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum keyboard the \u201cRolls Royce of gaming keyboards.\u201d  As an all-around keyboard, however, it's not only a Rolls Royce but also a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati, Bently...well, you get the picture.  The K95 XT also falls under this description.  One of the first things you\u2019ll notice about either K95, are their heft and stiffness.  This thing weighs a ton (for a keyboard).  Both of the K95s owe their heft and rigidity to their inspired aircraft-grade anodized brushed aluminum frame, which screams: QUALITY!  As a result, the K95 doesn\u2019t flex even under the most relentless pounding as most plastic keyboards would.  The next thing that pops out at you is this keyboard\u2019s beauty.  Corsair has long been known for its quality keyboards and the K95 XT doesn\u2019t disappoint in the least.  Compared to all other keyboards (regardless of price), both K95s are works of art you\u2019ll continue to appreciate long after you\u2019ve purchased one.I purchased a K95 in 2019 and a K95 XT in 2020.  These two keyboards are nearly identical, so one may ask, \u201cWhy would you buy two nearly identical and VERY expensive keyboards?\u201d  Of course, I could answer, \u201cBecause I can,\u201d but the very subtle improvements of the K95 XT simply won me over.  Little things bothered me.  I ordered my K95 with Brown switches because that was the closest choice to my preferred keyswitch, the Blues, which were unavailable on the original K95.  Corsair, in my opinion, made a huge mistake not offering Blue and Green keyswitches with the original K95.  They could have sold many more K95s had they done so.  I ordered my K95 XT with Blue switches.  In addition, I hated the cheap, hard plastic wrist rest that came with the original K95.  The K95 XT\u2019s pillow-like plush leatherette wrist rest is a HUGE improvement and brings its flagship keyboard up to the standard long ago adopted by many of the best keyboard manufacturers, all Corsair competitors.There are, of course, other subtleties that won me over to the K95 XT, but the elephant in the room was the real reason for my purchase of an XT\u2014my K95 had a glaring malfunction: the USB disconnected continually, rendering the keyboard useless. Corsair gladly suggested I return the keyboard in exchange for a new one.  I never did return the K95 because I was convinced the problem was with the iCUE software, not the keyboard.  I decided to wait until Corsair fixed the software problem.  I was wrong, it WAS a hardware problem.  Now it\u2019s too late to return the keyboard.  My new K95 XT, thankfully, is free of this hardware problem (experienced by MANY K95 purchasers), and works flawlessly.  I regret not sending my original K95 back to Corsair in exchange for a new one.  It does, however, serve as a very excellent paperweight.My purchase of an XT and not another high-end keyboard like Corsair\u2019s new K100, reveals my fondness for the original K95 design: solid, beautiful, classic, refined, stylish, but not flashy.  It is still a work of art, professional and preferable to DIY mechanical keyboards.  Many \u201cin-the-know\u201d folks say that an owner of the original K95 should stay the course rather than \u201cupgrade\u201d to the XT and, in large part, I agree.  Unless, of course, you\u2019re like me and can use and appreciate the subtle improvements of the XT and can afford the expense.Mechanical KeyswitchesAs a flagship keyboard, the K95 XT is, of course, a mechanical keyboard, which refers to its mechanical keyswitches.  The keyswitch choice for the K95 is, unfortunately, very limited to two types: Cherry MX Speed and Cherry MX Brown.  The K95 XT adds Cherry MX Blue and Cherry MX Speed Silvers.  Of course, the Speeds are preferable for gaming while the Browns are meant to be a compromise between gaming and typing.  The Blues are clickier versions of the Browns, a very popular keyswitch and my personal favorite, although I fell in love with the Browns.  While I infrequently play video games and most of my work involves writing and general typing, the Speeds were out of the question for me.  I can\u2019t get enough (obviously) of the loud click and tactile bump the Blues and Greens provide.  Many would agree with me, but just as many find the Blues and Greens to be intolerable (as do other members of the household and fellow office workers often do).  The Browns are really a \u201csilent\u201d version of the Blues and don\u2019t provide much of a tactile bump.  Still, the Browns manage to deliver a VERY satisfying typing experience.  They are crisp, precise and not all that silent.By-the-way, when referencing a Cherry MX Blue keyswitch, know that Cherry is the name of the manufacturer, a German company.  MX stands for \u201cmechanical\u201d and Blue describes this keyswitch\u2019s \u201cclickyness\u201d and tactile bump.Macro Keys and RemappingPerhaps the most useful feature of the K95s are the six macro keys running down the left side of the keyboard.  Along with the iCUE software that is downloadable from the Corsair website, you can program these macro keys to use keyboard events, mouse movements, mouse clicks and the mouse wheel to issue complex commands, select menu items or type long strings of characters.  Macros in each profile can be activated by a specific program associated with them, or you can manually switch between each profile with a simple key press.  Although there are only six macro keys, up to three onboard profiles (five with the XT) allow you to program and use up to eighteen macros (thirty with the XT). Unfortunately, many find programming macros and profiles in iCUE to be quite difficult.  The iCUE software does not present an intuitive interface and commands.  For instance, there\u2019s no way to \u201csave\u201d a macro or profile.  Unintuitively, iCUE saves the macro or profile you create automatically, without need to issue a \u201csave\u201d command.  Many find this \u201cfeature\u201d disconcerting (was the macro saved or not?).  The complexity and confusion of the iCUE software is due to its ability to use keyboard events, mouse movements, mouse clicks and the mouse wheel to issue complex commands and select menu items, not just keyboard events.  Learning to create profiles, for some, has a long learning curve and viewing YouTube videos to learn how to create profiles is essential. The tutorial videos on the Corsair website are often narrated by speed-talkers who fly through explanations so fast, you find yourself rewinding sections and reviewing them over and over.  I must say, however, that once you \u201cget the hang of it,\u201d iCUE is a joy to use.Some people find the location of the macro keys problematic.  Some mistake the G1 key with the \u201cESC\u201d key, while others mistake the G6 key with the \u201cCTRL\u201d key.  Fortunately, I have no such problem since the macro keys are textured and color-coded.  What if eighteen macro keys aren\u2019t enough for you?  The iCUE software enables you to \u201cremap\u201d any key to do anything you want it to do, including making keys other than the six G keys behave like macro keys.  This allows you to use those otherwise almost useless \u201cF\u201d keys at the top of the keyboard to finally start pulling their own weight as additional macro keys.  Also, often unused keys (like the Pause / Break key, the Insert key, the Scroll Lock key, etc.) can be remapped to become macro keys.  This remapping capability is a delight, an efficiency booster and time saver.RGB BacklightingThe keys on the K95s are individually lit (also called, \u201cper-key backlighting\u201d), unlike some RGB keyboards which often use zone lighting.  In zone lighting, one cannot assign a color to just one key\u2026it has to be to a third of the keys on the keyboard or a fourth.  In fact, most \u201cRGB\u201d keyboards utilize zone lighting, not per-key lighting, which is a premium feature.  The keycap characters on both K95s are big, bold and allow plenty of backlight to shine through them, making typing in low light or no light situations a breeze.  The XT has double-shot PBT keycaps which is somewhat of an improvement over the K95.  Many backlit keyboards use small, skinny keycap characters and/or dim backlighting, negating the whole point of backlit keys.  Such keyboards make typing in the dark a difficult proposition.  The K95s have a button with a sun symbol on it which adjusts backlight brightness: Off, Dim, Medium and Bright.The K95s use true RGB L.E.D. lighting.  Many keyboards tout RGB backlighting as a feature.  In their case, it\u2019s true that Red+Blue=Purple and that other combinations of Red, Green and Blue (RGB) can create other colors.  Such keyboards, in reality, have only eight or ten colors available to them.  However, the K95s use the entire RGB spectrum, which contains approximately 16.8 million colors.  The K95s utilize \u201cbrightness\u201d to expand the RGB spectrum.  This allows the K95 to display truly amazing lighting effects such as the \u201cSpiral Rainbow\u201d and other effects which you can either create yourself or import into iCUE from the internet or obtain from a friend.You can also customize the keyboard with functional backlighting.  For instance, I made all the alphabetic character keys shine with a white light, while the number pad keys illuminate in cyan; the ESC, Delete, Enter, Backspace, Del, keypad Num, Enter and Decimal point keys all shine in red; the Tab, Caps Lock and both Shift and Alt keys shine in blue, the G keys shine in pink, the F keys shine in cyan, etc.  The F key shines in yellow (YouTube enlarge, minimize window), while the J key shines in cyan (YouTube rewind 10 seconds), the K key shines in magenta (YouTube Stop) and the L key shines in green (YouTube advance 10 seconds).  This makes each grouping of keys distinct and quickly identifiable, making typing in a darkened environment much easier.  My computer desk happens to be located in a dimly-lit corner and I prefer working in a darkened environment anyway, but with the K95\u2019s bold key characters and brilliant backlighting, typing is a cinch\u2014especially at night, when that corner gets even darker.Whether you purchase the K95 (approximately $176) or the K95 XT (approximately $230), you\u2019ll have a premium keyboard that\u2019s a joy to use and a great addition to your art collection.  K95 users need not upgrade to the K95 XT unless they need and appreciate the K95 XT's subtle improvements and can afford the expense.  Both provide a keyboard\u2019s basic functions and much more.  Except for some subtle differences, both K95s are basically indistinguishable from each other.",
          "Have been using this for over 2 years now. Not a single problem. Use for gaming and work. iCue software is a little bloated tho",
          "Ok backstory. I had a G.Skill ripjaws KM### some such I don't remember the model exactly with MX reds but sufficed to say it was an LED keyboard with a dedicated LED volume level indicator and every single feature that's on this keyboard too. And that was several years when it came out. For it's time it was amazing.There had been few updates for the software and firmware and the latest one was very long ago. It was very buggy. The profiles would get deleted from the board if the computer crashed. It is still a nice keyboard but it was just very annoying to use. So I hesitantly decided to upgrade.Boy oh boy was I glad I did. This thing is amazing. When I was researching it even I watched videos of the keyboard I wasn't too sure about the brightness of the LED lighting on this but let me assure you there is nothing to worry about. Also on this board I got the MX speed. Yes they are very similar to the MX reds. But after using reds for a very long time the first thing I picked up on was a slight bit more smoothness to the key presses and as long as you don't bottom out they sound just slightly quieter. Not much. But enough for me to notice. I also saw a lot of people complain about the wrist rest on this. My previous board came with a hard plastic one so this is light years better than.At any rate those were 3 of my biggest concerns with getting this. I'm sure there's lots of fact sheets and reviewers who have delved into all of the technical specs. But I can tell you if you have a budget for this board and you are considering it I would say go for it. It's hard not to fall in love with it us icue does have its faults but it's a lot better than most others apps.Just FYI....I also upgraded my trusty corsair M65 Pro mouse for the Corsair Dark Core Pro...stunning combo with this board and the lighting syncs perfectly between the 2.",
          "Corsair kind of makes me sick with this keyboard.  I expect a lot more from a company like Corsair and I have owned many of their products.  BEWARE before buying this.  I took this brand new keyboard out of the box and plugged it in.  I must say it looks beautiful and feels great under my fingers.  I went through a lot of trouble to connect this to my keyboard.  The cord is very think and has two USB ports that must be plugged in.  My computer is 6 feet high and the cable routing is a challenge so I only like to do things once.  I got it all setup properly and downloaded the new Corsair software.  While setting it up the first thing I see is an \"update software\" button.  I always like to have the newest and best drivers and software running so of course I click that.  Suddenly, the key board DIED.  dead out no lights no response.  I bricked the keyboard, from their software update.  I go through quite on order, unplugging and plugging it back in, rebooting my computer, the whole 9 yards.  So now I have to undo everything I did and plug the old keyboard back in to get on the internet to see what I did.  Something I wanted to avoid as I said my computer is high and not easily accessible.  After some time of searching I find out, this is a KNOWN issue for this keyboard and Corsair refuses to acknowledge or correct it.  Shame shame on you!  why would you put your customers through this?  and how many RGA's do you have to go through from people who arent skilled enough to search this, download the correct bin file, replace it on the keyboard memory and REBOOT the keyboard?  which is another thing, the reboot process is just insane to have us hold in a tiny button in with a pin while trying to plug and unplug TWO USB cables.  even if most computers arent 6 feet in the air.  This is a known issue, many many people on the forums have had the same problems,  your software is bricking YOUR own $200 keyboard.  fix the problem corsair and stop telling people its not your fault.  Liars make me sick, lying companies are worse.  anyone with google can verify this situation and you deny it and refuse to fix it.  I would expect this from a $30 Chinese knock off, not you.  Your software is crappy and overly complicated.  Many times I have had my lighting freeze and programming the G keys is just overly cumbersome.  I  am so disappointed that a wonderful and well built keyboard from a top notch company is ruined by the software experience.  Please get your game together.  Until then I would recommend people consider these issues and possibly avoid this keyboard.",
          "I have 3 K70 vengeance keyboards. One with blue, red, brown cherry mx keys. Yes I've been hunting for my unicorn.  I didn't care about lightning but when your only option is red, it's hard to not feel like an adolescent when a woman your age stays over and everything is gamer red.  So I spent over $150 to replace not a good keyboard, but one of the best keyboards every for the sole purpose of using dim white lights to look a little more sophisticated.There is no \"white\" and white is so cool in temperate a sane person could ONLY call it blue.  Blue is not an improvement over red.So I was disappointed and wished I didn't waste money...until I started to use it.These are the best switches ever.The lightning? Well sometimes it's yellow and purple and blue all at once and I imbrance my inner possibly female teenager.  Then, I switch it over to dim orange that matches the candles and I have no complaints from the women my age :)",
          "The G keys on the left of the keyboard shift the whole alignment of the keys so much that typing and gaming is impossible if used to any other layout.  Just for an easy example to see, I constantly hit the G1 key when I mean to hit Esc.  I hit caps lock when trying to hit A.  I hit multiple keys when trying to type anything.  I use multiple keyboards of varying sizes so it isn't the new size or placement.  I type just fine on my laptop which is much smaller than my desktop.  The layout is horrible.  Feels more compact than my laptop even though it isn't and the G keys on the left are absolutely horrible for anything unless this is your first keyboard.  I use Corsair for my power supply, memory, and CPU cooler but I'm not buying another keyboard from them any time soon.I had to send it back.  That said.  The keys and switches feel really nice.  If you have the time to get used to a non standard key layout then this is probably going to be a very nice keyboard for you.  But, for anyone who has years into a traditional layout, and spends hours per day typing on it, it is utterly UNUSEABLE.",
          "My son said really likes this keyboard. Said it is good to hear the click of the keys and also the fact that they light up. He games almost every night and enjoys this keyboard.",
          "This keyboard IMO is the best of the best. Yea, it is a bit more expensive than other out there, but you are getting more. You get an option of many different Cherry MX keys(I went with Blue), a USB pass through, GREAT RGB lighting, added macro keys and a VERY comfortable wrist rest.I have tried the Razer Blackwidow V3 and the Elite. Both are good keyboards, but the Elite, while it had a nice wrist rest(magnetic) had black key bases so it's RGB lighting is dim and the V3, which does have good RGB lighting, didn't have the USB pass through and came with a hard plastic wrist rest that doesn't attach , in any way, to the keyboard(no magnets or anything, it just sits there). The green Razer keey were pretty good but no match for the feel and sound of true Cherry MX Blue keys.Another thing I love about the K95 is the ability to load lighting profiles directly to the keyboard so you do NOT need to be running iCue to get the lighting effects you want. This is a nice thing to have when you want to run a minimized set up for gaming or move the keyboard to another computer. Razer has none of this.On top of this, the light really blows Razer out of the water. With the exception of the Blackwidow V3, all Razer RGB keyboards seem dim and under lit compared to Corsair. The translucent key bases make all the difference. Plus this has an added RGB light bar at the top of the keyboard for an extra add effect, which looks awesome. And the Corsair log is at the top of the keyboard, so it does NOT get hidden by the write rest, unlike Razer's keyboards, which have the log at the bottom.The one (big) minus I will give Corsair is iCue. It is a big step behind Razer in programmability. It seems to take a lot more steps to accomplish what is easily done in Razer's Synapse. Plus, if you have multiple Razer devices, it allows you to group the devices so when you set a lighting profile, it applies to ALL devices. In iCue, you have to set the lighting profile for EACH device independently, which is a complete waste of time. To add to this, while Corsair has profiles that you can load to the keyboard directly, you have to program them in it's own HARDWARE tab and you CANNOT copy regular lighting profiles to the Hardware tab. So you basically have to program the light profile TWICE. Another waste of time.ProsSolid constructionchoice of different Cherry MX keysUSB pass throughGREAT and BRIGHT RGB lighting, with added light bar and logo at top, which won't get blocked by wrist restMacro keysNicely padded wrist restConsiCue - Corsair really needs to step it up and look at how Razer does Synapse as there are many head scratching things in iCue.All in all this is a great keyboard. If you are after great RBG lighting and added macro keys, get this. Just be prepared for some extra effort needed for iCue.",
          "Guys, stop reading this and just buy it, best advice I can give you.I have had two of these now, I bought a K95 Platinum with Speed Switches and a K95 Platinum XT with Blue Switches, both by Cherry MX.First off, Cherry MX switches are the business. They sound the best, look the best, feel the best because they are the best, hands down.Second off, the materials that this keyboard is made of had to of come from the most premium of parts vendors because even the keycaps feel like a luxury. My Mercedes Benz's parts have a feel that resembles the feel I get when typing on this keyboard, so I can only describe it as a luxury.The LEDs... WOW. They are extremely bright and allow multiple different brightness settings. You can change the color of absolutely every LED on this keyboard and the light bar across the top is comprised of 12 different lights that can be addressed individually. The lighting effects that you can make with this keyboard are endless and the community has tons of designs available for download if you cannot make it yourself. iQUE's software allows for just about anything you can imagine to be done to this keyboard's LED lights.The typing and gaming experience is just simply a pleasure. Typing this review right now feels like an absolute delight and the sound it is making is nothing short of pure bliss. Oh, and did I mention it has media controls too? Cause uh yeah, it does, and man is that a feature all keyboards should have. For gaming, you have six macro keys that come in handy and are easy to reach. The texturized keycaps make sure your fingers are not going to accidentally slide onto Q when you don't want to ultimate in Overwatch. They also include a keycap with the Corsair boat on it, which is pretty awesome, and I used it to replace my, \"Esc,\" key.Everything is addressable and wildly customizable. The wrist rest is plush and feels absolutely amazing, seriously, one of the best placements for a wrist rest I have ever experienced.I strongly recommend the K95 Platinum XT over the Standard Platinum as it offers the integration with your stream deck and it also offers the Cherry MX Blue switches. Which I strongly recommend as they are pretty quiet for being MX Blues. If not, I would recommend the Cherry MX Reds or Browns for typing and gaming use. If you don't plan on doing much typing and a lot of gaming, go with the Cherry MX Speeds.Buy this keyboard guys, it is worth it, you keep keyboards for years anyway. Go ahead and treat yourself, you won't regret it.",
          "I am absolutely in love with this keyboard. the k95 platinum xt has all the bells and whistles you would need for gaming,streaming, and just general use. I went with the cherry mx speed silver version and its very responsive. the lighting effects with the icue software is really great because you can sync all of your Corsair rgb to match. the quality of this keyboard is top notch. Corsair did not skimp on anything i think. it has a great mechanical clicky clack sound the volume wheel at the top right is im assuming aluminium. the keyboard itself is made with a nice brushed metal top and plastic bottom. the wrist rest that attaches to it is comfortable and feels quality made. the keyboards cord has 2 usb plugs attached to it for a passthrough so you can plug your mouse or something else directly into the keyboard. i really like this feature as it allowed me to better place my mouse cord. keyboard is well worth the price imo. the only gripe i have and its not that big of a deal is the fact the legs on the bottom to raise the keboard go left and right so i tend to make it fall because im constantly moving the keyboard around for different uses. i move it to the left more for gaming, directly in front of me for other uses. but ya the legs need a lock or something because they fall easily when u slide the keyboard left or right.",
          "Finally got the keyboard was late but Finally came in and was worth it. Great keyboard.",
          "This is my new favorite keyboard. I love how the lights are customizable. I have all of the alphabet letters as red, other keys are purple, media and macro keys are green. I like being able to switch profiles to make WASD cyan, or switch profiles again to show off the rainbow wave lighting effect. I like how the volume wheel is 1:1 analog no matter how fast you spin it. I absolutely love the 6 macro keys, and how you can assign different macros to different profiles.I do NOT like the iCUE software and the software profiles. I think it has a problem when using my virtual machines (I use a VMware VM for work), and the keys will stick and delay. For example, I could be typing on my work vm and it will randomly repeat a keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeypress kind of like this. I was able to resolve this by setting up hardware profiles for my keyboard and making sure that iCUE was not running in my systttttttttttttttttttttem tray. Unfortunately, hardware profiles have reduced functionality, compared to software profiles (eg, I cannot replace my media Stop key with an Open Calculator function).I am also not a fan of the keyboard feet. They are aligned to open and close laterally (left / right), instead of the normal forward/backwards. So if I shift my keyboard left or right a bit, one of the legs will collapse and I have to pick it up and re-open it. Minor annoyance, but nothing terrible.One of my biggest disappointments for this keyboard is that the switches are soldered in. So if you are a fan of custom mechanical keyboards and were considering lubing and filming all of your keys... think again. The only way to do that on this keyboard is if you completely disassemble it and de-solder all the switches.I've had this keyboard for four months now. I am disappointed that I couldn't lube / film the keys, and don't really feel like doing any soldering right now. Some of the springs in the switches are a little twangy, and you can hear the medium-high-pitched tone of them vibrating while you are typing (eg, think of the springs as a harp string, and pressing the key is like plucking the string). The noise is not as bad as it was when the keyboard was new, but it is still slightly noticeable. Maybe given a few more months it will get better?That is a lot of nit-picking though. This is still absolutely my favorite keyboard, mainly due to the customizable lights and the macro keys. If you ever need to do something super repetitive in a spreadsheet that cannot be solved with formulas, this keyboard has totally got your back.",
          "The great:- Cherry MX Blue keys rock- Dedicated macro keys- Nice lighting- Volume knob- Seems like a high quality overall keyboard.The egregious:Their iCUE software causes audio stuttering.  It is present on every application: media players playing local video and audio files, Amazon Music, YouTube, other media streaming services...  everything!  It was a huge waste of time trying to determine iCUE was the issue.  Corsair has known about it for over a year and they still have not fixed it.  To quote the solution:1. Open the iCUE installation folder and locate \"Corsair.Service.CpuIdRemote64.exe\"2. Kill the Corsair CpuIdRemote process with the task manager or any process manager3. Quickly change that file extension to anything you want, for example \"Corsair.Service.CpuIdRemote64.exe.dumb\", this will prevent the service from restarting4. EnjoyI got the Corsair after going through a bunch of different keyboards:- Das Keyboard Model S (great keyboard, Cherry MX keys, but no backlighting, and no volume knob - I tried the one with the volume knob and didn't like it for a forgotten reason);- Razer Black Widow (nice keyboard, no volume knob, got it at least a half a decade ago and from what I recall, I just don't use it because it doesn't have a volume knob);- G.Skill KM780 ($100, nice keyboard, Cherry MX keys, macro keys, backlighting, volume knob, I went through two and they usually lasted about a couple of years for various reasons, it is no longer available);- Redragon K580 ($50, lighting, clicky keys, macro keys, volume knob, it had a couple of issues with some keys, so I returned it);- Microsoft Surface ($85, soft keys, portable, Bluetooth, with soft non-clicky keys for conference calls and web meetings, not a fan: it quickly started having Bluetooth issues and you cannot even give such a relatively expensive keyboard away on eBay); and- Logitech MX Keys ($110, great backlit Bluetooth keyboard, I swap this in to replace a Cherry MX keyboard for conference calls and web meetings because it has soft non-clicky keys so you don't annoy listeners, it also has an extra little perk of dedicated buttons for pairing it with multiple devices).I got this $200 Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT in an attempt to ensure everything was rock solid and high quality.  So far, everything has been pretty great...  Aside from the big headache it caused with the audio.  So much for spending a lot of $ to try to get a product without issues.  Since I finally figured out the audio problem, I am keeping it because it is otherwise a great keyboard.(You might be wondering why I keep mentioning the volume knob, and that is simply because all the websites, streaming services, local media players, web meetings often have different volume settings.  Thus, you might have the volume up for one service and then open another service that blows your ears off or open a webpage that you didn't expect to start playing loud audio.  A dedicated volume knob is the quickest way of setting the volume to a reasonable level and I filter my searches for keyboards with volume knobs).",
          "I've had this keyboard for a couple years now. I think it has been long enough to leave an actual review of it here. It works great for gaming or typing in general. The keys are tall therefore it is easy to clean. You can even pop off all the keys if you want a puzzle to put together. Maybe use it as a game for your kids.I don't have any actual gripes but if there is one possible complaint that some might have. It's that when you drop it on the floor several of the keys might pop off and fly into random places around the room, or under your couch, bed, or wherever you use it. I've dropped mine a couple times and had to go find keys and sometimes I have to do it quickly before my dog finds them.The cables that connect the keyboard to the PC are great too. They are not just rubber cables, they have a nice covering that worked well to protect the cables the few times my puppy decided to try to chew on them and I didn't see it in time. They still look pretty well protected despite those incidents.Overall this is an awesome keyboard. You can have a light show or you can dim them or turn the lights off as well, or just go to a single color. The volume control thing is a nice addition also.97.5/100",

          "So here is the deal. I did not but this for a Gaming rig. At work I use my system so much that I regularly wear out conventual keyboards and mice. I had to look for a good mechanical keyboard to get my money's worth on something that will last. Before I would go through about two to three sets a year. I have been using this one about a year and a half now without any problems.The feel is wonderful and the durability is fantastique. I expect nothing less for Corsair. I use their products at home on a gaming rig there as well.",

          "Rally wanted to go with a wireless keyboard as the entire setup is essentially wire-free. The keyboard is the only wire present on my desk. The cord coming from the keyboard is quite beefy, terminating in two USB connectors. One for the keyboard and the other for powering the USB port on the top of the keyboard. The cord is adequately long and separates in to two USBs maybe a foot from the end. Although it is expensive, I really like it. The keys give a gratifying click. It isn't light by any measure. The iCue software doesn't readily agree with the Asus Aura I have for the rest of my build. I have downloaded the Elgato software, but haven't setup any of the \"G\" keys yet. Having the two different RGB software on my rig isn't ideal, but there haven't been any real conflicts; I'd prefer to use one for all the RGB components.The keyboard was shipped in the keyboard box as-is, not in another amazon box which seemed weird. Regardless, it worked fine and no damage to the keyboard itself.I don't plan on upgrading the keyboard anytime soon, so will continue to use this until it eventually gives out 50 million clicks from now (or whatever the insane number is).Past the initial cost of the keyboard, I recommend.",
          "This keyboard has been my daily driver for about two years now and I\u2019ve had basically no issues with it. The key caps are easily removable and allow for easy cleaning and my only issue with it is that the rgb computer program can be a little clunky and hard to figure out.",

It did not have noise cancelling and for other reasons this became important to me.  I bought a Bluetooth headset produced by Monster.  Love the feel and the quality and no cord however I was getting audio breakup.  After a lot of digging, I found out my beloved iMac Bluetooth wasn't up to running a headset, mouse, and keyboard without issue.  For years I have heard from others (family) the advantages of the Corsair keyboards.  So I gave it a shot.  Love the keyboard.  I haven't figured out just how I want to use the LED features.

          "I had/have the K95 Platinum XP with the speed switches and I loved it, for gaming it's phenomenal. However if you also type quite a bit those can get a little lifeless in my experience. The browns are probably the most balanced for gaming and typing but I have been eyeing one with Blue switches for a few years, reminiscing of my old Northgate keyboards from the 90s.The keyboard is fantastic, everything works great, the lights, the feel the keycaps etc... My PC setup is all Corsair from an RGB standpoint - Keyboard, Headset, Mouse, AIO, Memory, fans etc... Perhaps because I'm not running software from multiple vendors I don't have issues with iCUE as some others note but switched from another gaming company about 3 years ago and haven't had any issues with Corsair's software.The one thing I will note is that this is my first set of MX Blue switches. They are a little more stiff than what I was expecting. Coming from the Speed Silvers they are very different. Typing a lot my hands do not get a tired with the Blue Switches, there is more bounce back however I actually believe I can type a little faster on the speed.Bottom line is that if you want clicky these are fantastic but I don't think you can go wrong with either option on the K95 Plat, it's an amazing keyboard all the way around. I can also say that my youngest was happy to take my old K95 Plat as an upgrade from his K70... I think he actually uses the macro keys more than I do!",
          "Keyboards like this are of course marketed to gamers. However, I am not a gamer. I am a writer. From my perspective, this is an excellent keyboard.The Cherry MX RGB keys are excellent for typing. I chose the Blue keys for their feel and for their clacking sound -- I do not have to worry about disturbing others as I have my own workspace. (I had another keyboard mechanical Cherry Blue keys and loved it for the same reasons, although it had far fewer features than this one.) I am able to achieve a typing speed of about 85 to 90 words per minute with this keyboard if the wind is at my back.Of course, the keyboard has pretty, pretty lights. Honestly, I don't need them. That said, I have built my own PC with advanced gaming components in order to handle music mixing. It, too, has pretty, pretty lights. Why not have a keyboard that has them too, right?Still, functionality and not esthetics is my priority. So, I set up my lighting scheme so that it highlights the home row with a gentle pulsating glow, and even alerts me when I have the caps lock key down by sending a red wave through the keyboard. I have various other lighting configurations set up on the keyboard that serve an actual function. I have to admit, it looks cool.This being my first RGB keyboard, I was puzzled that the keys weren't as bright as the monochrome LED Cherry Blue keys I have on my prior keyboard. On this keyboard, even at its brightest setting, the key lighting doesn't show very well in my well-lit space. Maybe if I were a gamer, I'd have a dimly lit space so that this would not be an issue. After doing some research, I learned that there are keycaps I can purchase that have translucent bases so that they pass through more light. I've just ordered SteelSeries PRISMCAPS, which are in a double shot pudding-style. TIP: In my research, I learned that the Corsair keyboards do not use the standard sizes of keycaps in the spacebar row. The PRISMCAPS keycaps are bundled with the right spacebar row keycaps for this keyboard.I already have an Elgato Stream Deck so the macro keys, which can optionally use the free Elgato Stream Deck software, are really not needed. That said, as long as I have them, I have set them up to launch various apps and/or websites that I frequently need when I am working. In my case, I used the Elgato software. After just a few days it was easy to get used to the escape key no longer residing on the upper left of the keyboard, but one key over, to accommodate the macro keys.The keyboard is excellent and I'm happy with it. Even so, I gave it a four-star rating rather than five. The reason is that the software is quite powerful but not especially intuitive. I was irritated that there was not a detailed reference manual to refer to. Sure, there are videos from the manufacturer to look at, and quite a few forum threads and YouTube videos that users have made. But honestly, the software has evolved quite a bit, which perhaps shows that Cosair is working to improve it; but as a result, many of the user videos and postings I found were obsolete in some material way and not very helpful. That cost me about an hour and half of time learning to use the software to customize my keyboard. My time is valuable.",

          "I wanted to write a review in case someone else ran into the issue I did.  Corsair updates their accessories through ICUE at this point.  When I personally tried this myself, the update failed and basically bricked the keyboard.  DONT BE ALARMED IF THIS HAPPENS!  Corsair was extremely quick and helpful when I called their support #.  Mine fell under the CPR DISABLD error.  Once I mentioned what it was, Corsair sent me over a new file to drag over and all issues went away.  Of course this isnt ideal, but it was something I was concerned over as I didn't even get to use the keyboard!!However, once the issue was resolved, the keyboard has been functioning great ever since.  Corsair did a nice job with the versatility of the RGBs through their ICUE program.  As far as function of the keyboard goes, this is my first mechanical keyboard and I am very satisfied with the feel of it.  Do your homework on what style of action from the keys you want.  The Cherry is definitely a nice soft feel which I prefer, instead of (I believe) blue where it feels and sounds like you're typing on an old school type writer.",
          "This keyboard is great. The keys are very responsive, and it takes next to no effort to get an input on screen. It is a dream to play video games with, and the typing experience isn't bad either, even with the curved wasd keys you get (this is optional, it comes with the regular keys installed). The wrist rest is nothing special, I wish it had a thicker, more firm cushion. It's very thin and cheap. I'm pretty sure my wrists are resting on the hard part right now, but it's not uncomfortable when using it so it's ok. I think the wrist rest should be better for a 195$ keyboard. The software is a little less than great, but it's totally fine. It offers tons of fun light preset options and allows you to make your own. The only issue I have with it is that when I boot up my PC, it doesn't launch automatically, and at the same time it will automatically create a minimum of 5 profiles named after the keyboard. I don't know why, but it happens after you delete those profiles. I deleted them because I accidently switch profiles with a button on my mouse actively changing my button maps on my mouse. It's annoying for obvious reasons.  I just mapped the profile switch button on my (Dark Core SE) mouse to \"tab\" so that should fix the profile switch problem.If you want a quality top-of-the-line gaming keyboard with all of the bells and whistles. This is a strong contender. I recommend this keyboard it's great gaming keyboard despite its shortcomings.",

It appears to be very well made.  If you are only a gamer and you have medium to large hands, I am sure you will love it for typing.  If not, then it is not quite perfect, but more than adequate for all purposes. I would probably give this a 4.5 if I could.",

And I only do blue/green switches, so my options are limited.The Razers feel a little more solid to me and the typing experience is a little better.The dedicated macro keys, better volume control (the round rocker on some Razers stop working over time... the Corsair volume roller is much better) and the USB passthrough of the K95 Blue are winners for me.",

          "Great keyboard.  I am not a gamer but I wanted something with mechanical switches and the Cherry MX Blues are close to ideal if you touch type and don't have anyone nearby.",
          "My first mechanical keyboard, had it about a month so far I and I really like it.  Exclusively used for typing - emails and some light coding - for work, 8+ hours a day at home.  The tactile bump that's there at the halfway point is barely noticeable, for better or worse.Two things I wish I knew.....1)  iCUE software is a pig.  I use a USB dock to toggle between work and home PCs, installed iCUE on my home PC to get everything setup.  Checked a couple days later, and the app takes up almost 4GB of disk??  And it runs a bunch of background processes.  Thankfully, you can load your lighting schemes and macros, keymaps, etc - although with some restrictions - into the KB memory.  So I config it from my home PC, save to hardware memory, and switch to my work PC that doesn't have iCUE installed.  As an IT guy, we would never let users install such a big bloated piece of software just to run lights and macros.Not a deal-breaker, but I wish the hardware mode did more of what the software does.  HW lets you onlyk have 5 lighting \"layers\" (combination of which keys and which lighting effect), SW seems unlimited.  Macros/keymapping in SW have more and easier options than HW.  For example, I wanted to map G1 to calculator (I use that shortcut button a lot for work on my old Logi).  In SW it works great, you can setup any app to launch.  in SW the best I found so far was to have it map the old CTL +ALT + <key> hotkey setting from the Windows shortcut.  For some reason it's much slower to respond to that vs the native launcher from SW, and I'm still having some issues getting it to work consistently from SW.2) Non-standard keycap sizes.  One of the reasons I bought this was to have some fun with customizing keycaps.  I did some research and understood the different profile heights, materials, etc.  What I didn't realize was that this and some other Corsair keyboards don't use typical key widths on the bottom row.  Typical seems to be 1.25U CTL / Win / ALT and 6.25U Spacebar.  Corsair is 1.5U CTL, 1U Win, 1.25U ALT, 6.25U spacebar.  I bought a complete set of Orange and Brown keycaps for my Atari theme in the picture, but had to keep the original space and win key, and get a little creative with the right-win and right-click keys since the intended ones don't fit.  I've since found a very few \"Corsair 104\" keycap sets specifically designed for this KB, but in a much much smaller variety than the the standard size sets.I bought this used on Amazon at almost half off in like-new condition, so considering that I'm happy.",
          "Pros:  Cherry Brown Switches are extremely well made to last for years.  You can program each individual key any color you want plus it has some fun lighting effects.  The macro keys are handy.Cons:  A bit noisy, clickety clack, would not be good in an office environment or a roommate situation.  The software is huge (1 gb) and programming is a bit of a learning curve.  The price is steep.",
          "the extra usb port on the keyboard itself is wonderful.the macro keys are perfect and you can set them up with streamdeck to do normal stuff.i'm a gamer so i'm pretty lazy, but the keycaps come off relatively easy so you can do a deep clean.compressed air will suffice though.this mf is a unit i don't plan on replacing mine anytime soon.",
          "starting my career on IBM mainframes way back in the day, I used 3277-type keyboards for years.  Loved the mechanical feel and that \"clack\" sound as you struck the keys.  After IBM sold their keyboard technology a couple of times, a company in Louisville bought the rights to produce the original design mechanical keyboards and I have been using them for years.  I started seeing Cherry MX keys popping up everywhere and looked into them to make sure I was not missing anything.  I ordered one of these and WOW.  I know some folks don't get excited about a keyboard, but I have worked from a home office for years and have several home PC's, so I use 3 keyboards across all of those systems.  I type a lot.  AND I have played FPS video games for about 25 years, so my keyboards get a workout.  This Corsair is simply fantastic.  I have always typed fast, but I can really fly across this board.  I got the brown Cherry keys that require almost a full stroke to actuate.  And corsair didn't forget about the FPS gamer in me.  they include replacement keys for W, A, S, D, the lifeblood of PC FPS gamers.  they have a dish shape and a diamond plate surface to prevent slippage.  I'm not really into LED lighting systems on keyboards, so I have the light on all 3 keyboards set for white.  the soft padded wrist rest finishes out the package nicely.  This is an expensive keyboard, but if you are serious about your PC use, you must try one of these.  Cannot recommend highly enough..",
          "The keyboard feels great! I love the tactile feedback of the brown switches. The hand rest is comfortable. It feels stable and of high quality. I also like that the USB passthrough is on the left because I use it for my headset. However the software, icue4, is not intuitive and is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Another imperfection is the space bar. It's barely noticable, but the space bar does have a tiny bit of wobble.",
          "My previous keyboard was a Corsair K70 from about 4-5 years ago.  It was a nice keyboard and served me pretty well.  My main gripe with it was I was having to unplug/plug it in frequently.  This problem occurred on 3 different computers (2 PC's and a Macbook Pro).  Found messages in the Corsair forum about it - but not answers.So, I build a new computer recently and decided to get a new keyboard.  I liked the feel of the K70 I used to own.  This one feels great to type on.  The keys have more texture.  I also have a different Cherry switch - blue.  It has a lot more click to it - but I work in the basement by myself for the most part.  I spend 90% of my time coding - so lots of typing.  It's a nice feel.The keyboard comes with extra keys on the side that I probably won't use.  I might have been better off getting a model without these.  They throw my typing off - I am not a proper typer and have been used to my pinky reset on the side of tab, shift, and ctrl.  This isn't a ding against this keyboard - but it is throwing my typing off.  I'll get used to it eventually.I'm not a big fan of the font they used on the keys.  The alpha/numeric keys are fine.  However, parentheses, curly brackets, and regular brackets are not exactly clear.  I'm used to the location as I'm a coder - but looking at them, it's not always clear what key is what.RGB LEDs - I will admit that these are cool.  However, I have them very subtly lit when I'm working.  I do not want the shiny lights distracting me.  I'm going to have to check for any Visual Studio Code integration - would be cool to highlight some of the short cuts or similar.  The iCue software is nice enough - I played around and created a few different configurations I like.  I also use a different configuration for work vs personal time with it.  Nice.Volume/media controls - these are the same as my old K70.  I like these a lot - especially the volume wheel.New wrist pad.  I think I like it.  The old K70 had a hard piece of plastic - it worked fine and I was used to it.  The new one is much softer and in theory should provide more comfort.  I'm not used to 100% but think I will like it.Feet rests - junk.  Come one - what is up with rests that fold out sideways?  It is very easy for a lateral movement to cause these to collapse.  The K70 had the same feet.  I am scratching my head over this feature.  I don't use them but would be disappointed if I were.USB passthrough.  Seems to work fine.  The K70 worked fine as well.  Good spot to plug in your mouse.As I mentioned before, it has macro keys  on the left - 6 in total.  I kind of doubt I will be using these = but could be nice if I could integrate into an IDE I use for coding (like Visual Studio).The most important feature of the new keyboard - I don't have to keep unplugging/plugging it in.  My monitor has a KVM - I share the keyboard, mouse, and web cam with a Mac and Windows computer.  The old K70 was a 50/50 if I had to do the unplug/plug dance.  It was infuriating.  Haven't had the issue with the K95 yet.This keyboard was expensive.  I could have gotten by with less RGB, no macro keys, etc.  However, I will probably be using this keyboard for at least the next 5 years.  I will get my money out of it over time.",
          "This keyboard has it all in terms of a feature list.Pros:1. Good switches. I went with MX Brown which is my preference for most mechanical keyboards.2. RGB is really good. Building layers to have a base backlight in addition to effects is really fun.3. The macro keys work well as long as you stick to the iCue software. Stream Deck is very limited.4. The volume scroll wheel is really nice. I wish all my keyboards had a scroll wheel like this.5. I can type fast (for me) with few mistakes.Neutral:1. I appreciate the Doubleshot PBT Keycaps but the keycaps on my Durgod feels much nicer.2. I actually like the wrist rest but I don't think it's quite as functional as it should be.Cons:1. Sound. Most mechanical switches produce a slight metallic resonance. This keyboard amplifies it the extent that you will hear it all the time. Honestly sometimes it's too much. Some will not mind if but if you don't want to hear high pitched metallic sounds with each keypress then don't buy this. Not a great sounding keyboard.2. No-standard bottom row key-caps. Not a huge deal but limits those who want to customize more.3. Bad software bricked mine. Three times!!! They claimed it was old software that failed to update the firmware but even after updating the software is bricked my keyboard. There's a manual work around posted on their forums.This is a keyboard where the sum is not greater than the parts. It has top parts and capability but overall it just doesn't hold up to some of the cheaper alternatives. I have a plain Durgod I got here on Amazon with no backlighting that I will always prefer over the Corsair because it types and sounds wonderful.But...if you don't care about sound or feel as much (why would you by a mechanical keyboard) and want all the bells and whistles then this might be your jam.One last note. I rate things harder than other people. 5 = the best I've ever used. 4 = Excellent. I'm giving this a 3 and it'll probably be a 4 or 5 for some of you.",
          "so far so good",
          "The keyboard is made well, very solid, heavy. One thing I need to get used to is the lack of clicking when typing like what old mechanical keyboards used to have. I'm not sure whether a key was pressed properly without hearing that clicking sound. This new keyboard replaced my first generation Razer Blackwidow, it is still working, I just passed it to my son.",
          "Look, lets get this out of the way:  This is a great keyboard.  Really solid and well put together.  I've tried around 12 mechanical setups in the past month and this one is clearly the best (most were in the $50-$75 range while this one is triple that, so it should be).  Big fan of the volume controls + roller, user/brightness/lock shortcut keys, and the 6 hotkeys down the left.  They give you 10 highly textured keys to swap out the left hand gaming keys.  In case you're unfamiliar, that's 6 for MOBA-style games and 4 for FPS games -- these are a nice set.  The base keys have a slightly rough texture that I like -- few typists want fully smooth keys.  I had no performance issues (response, ghosting, etc.) whatsoever.  If you're not familiar with Brown switches:  These give you a bit of feedback on keypress without all the noisy clicking of Blue switches (which sound like the old IBM mechanical keyboards) -- much better if you spend much time on the phone while typing.That said, once we've established its a REALLY NICE keyboard, I'm a bit annoyed by it.  I bought this high end mechanical keyboard because I want to customize it for typing and work.  But Corsair only considered customizing for gaming.  I thought I could use the gaming keycaps to meet some of my needs.  But the heavily slanted key tops make them undesirable for anything but gaming.  I was all set to bitch heavily about Corsair's lack of forethought in regard to non-gaming customization.  But honestly its gotta be tough to predict all the non-gaming ways someone may want to customize their board without including an entire set of alternate caps.  But at this price, maybe a full set of alternate caps shouldn't be out of the question.  At minimum, they should include ESC, WIN, DEL, F, J, ENT, Arrows and possibly a select few of A, F1, F5, F11, CTRL, ALT, Home, End, Backspace, and Tab (and 1-10 while they're at it!).  But again, this is just whining.  Its a great keyboard and its got good options for gaming.  If you want more, find a good set of laser etched PBTs and start swapping.",
          "Everything about this keyboard is perfect. The worst thing was the rainbow LED effects when first firing up the Corsair kb. This issue was quickly addressed after installing the ICUE (bloated app) and adjusting to a nice solid color. Love the feel, response, and accuracy of each keypress.Have not yet messed with  the Stream Deck features but will get to it eventually. Solid purchase, highly recommended."

          "The headphones are very comfortable, sound is great and battery life is amazing, even for someone who uses them for around 12 hours a day. They are very good all around, and they are the best headphones I've ever had. They would be perfect, but there's a few things weighing it down.The main problem for me is Corsair's GOD AWFUL software. You'll need iCUE  in order to monitor battery, change the lightning pattern or color, as well as change any other settings like disabling voice prompts or auto-shutdowns. The problem is, iCUE is quite possibly one of the worst pieces of software I've ever used.I'll try and list some of the software issues I've had while using iCUE:- I try to turn on the headphones, and they light up but this isn't registered on my computer. Nothing happens for around 15-30seconds until I finally get the voice prompt for it powering on. I would say this happens 1 out of every 5 times, and sometimes this also causes audio delay issues until my computer is restarted.- For some reason you can't check your battery level while the headphones are charging. You'll need to unplug the headphones in order to check the battery level. Sometimes, the software glitches and the battery status fails to change from Charging to show the battery level, so you just have to guess.- I'd say 9 out of every 10 times whenever I charge the headphones, the battery level won't go past 93%. Perhaps this is because I'm using them while they are charging, but no matter how long I charge them for they just won't go past 93%. The first few weeks of owning these headphones I thought this was just how it is, until one day I unplugged and it was at 100%. Next day it was back to not charging past 93%, so now it's a little mini-game every time I unplug it to guess where it's charged to 100, or 93%.- The voice prompts are LOUD. And there is NO WAY to turn their volume down. They are quite useful, so you won't want to disable them, but every time you disable your mic you'll get this lady shouting at your ear.Overall, they are great headphones, and I'd recommend them to anyone who doesn't mind dealing with Corsair's poor software.",
          "",
          "I've owned Corsair peripherals since I built my first gaming PC, and while I no longer own a desktop, I still use a Corsair mouse, keyboard, and headset with my laptop docking setup. I got the Corsair Void Pro RGB USB headset a few years back and loved them. They had great build quality and feel and sounded great with full Dolby surround 7.1 support. So, naturally, when looking for an upgrade/refresh, and wanting a wireless headset, the Void Elite RGB seemed like a great choice. They have the same overall design that I've liked so much and appeared to be at least a minor upgrade in every way.However, upon receiving the new headset and di=aiuly driving the Void Elite for around a month, I found myself disappointed with the sound quality. I didn't have the highest hopes for the uncertified 7.1 surround sound, and I still found myself disappointed. Not only does the surround on the Void Elite fail to live up to the Dolby 7.1 on the Void Pro, it honestly just sounds bad. I'm not sure if my unit is just defective, but the surround sounds horribly tinny and lacks the oomph of the Dolby 7.1. Furthermore, the stereo functionality of the Void Elite lags far behind the Void Pro as well. When comparing the two side-by-side, the Void Pro just sounds better in every way. The Void Elite lacks the same bass power, with the bass in the Void Elite unable to match the Void Pro even when the Elite has the bass cranked and the Pro is left at standard in the Corsair iCue EQ tuning. Furthermore, the mids tend to be noticeably muffled and the highs get drowned out by the bass.Overall, I'm disappointed by the Void Elite. The build quality and overall comfort were improved and the wireless functionality is great, but the sound quality took such a big step back that I honestly can't even force myself to use them anymore. If I was still within the return window, this headset would be on its way back to Amazon. Unfortunately, I'm stuck either keeping a headset I don't use and don't want or trying to sell them on eBay or Craigslist.TL,DR; Don't get these unless you don't care about sound quality. Better yet, save yourself the money and get the Void Pro USB headset. They sound lightyears better and the wireless functionality of the Void Elite isn't enough to tip the scales.",
          "Fits well, isnt fully noise canceling but it works for what I need. good price, mic is clear. very good sound quality",
          "Luego de tanto tiempo aun los sigo usando, funcionan correctamente. y la carga les puede llegar a durar un dia entero. La calidad es buena y la distancia tambi\u00e9n.",
          "Initial one star review: Straight out of the packaging, the headphones are disgusting. They smell as though they are covered in peanut butter. The microphone is damaged. I haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to use them because of how gross they look. I don\u2019t know how Amazon can let a product like this be sold. I\u2019m truly hoping I simply got a defective headset. I will be returning this headset for a new one. Hopefully then I can give this a better review.Updated review: I am going with four stars, because of the initial product being sent to me. The replacement headphones are so much better. The packaging was perfect, and there were no signs of tampering. The headset itself fits comfortably over the ears. The quality of sound is really good. The added bonus of getting to change the flashing colors on the side of the earbuds is fun. The software that needs to be downloaded, is free and easy to use. I am quite happy with the new headset that was sent.",
          "Mic can be finicky with mute on and off since you move it up or down to turn on/off but it will do it itself sometimes.Charge port broke at the headset a year after use.",
          "Bought for my bf and he lives them! He had an older pair, he says these are better all around, sound quality, comfortability, and also these are noise cancelling! Excellent purchase !",
          "For the price, it's a very good headset! Definitely an upgrade from the cheap one I had. It is by no means a top quality headset. But it's not cheaply made either. The sound quality is good. 7.1 surround is amazing! Bass is decent as well. I play a lot of FPS and with this headset you are able to easily hear footsteps and the direction they are coming from. The microphone picks up your voice pretty clearly. The iCue software works pretty well. It allows you to control everything from the EQ settings to sidetone levels to RGB color and intensity. The headset does fit loosely on my head. I actually like that because I wear glasses and it makes wearing the headset more comfortable for a long period of time. It's not too heavy either which helps keep it comfortable. The headset is very easy to control while wearing it as well. Volume switch is easy to find and work. The volume switch also allows to change the EQ settings to any of the presets quickly. You can also mute the mic by pressing the mute button on the side of the headset or by flipping the mic boom up. Pretty convenient.Some things I do not like about the headset are the battery life and, because it fits loosely on your head, it tends to shift position if you look down to the floor. I'm not sure if the issue with the battery is that it will not fully charge to100% or if the software isn't recog9that the battery is fully charged. It will charge to about 92%. However, the battery will last me a full day of gaming without needing to be recharged. So it does last as long as it's advertised, even if it doesn't show its 100% charged. The loose fitment, while it does make it more comfortable with glasses, it can let the headset move if you look down fast. I don't tend to look down too often so it's not a huge deal for me.Overall, I think this headset was worth the price and I would definitely buy it again.",
          "Excelente producto",
          "Have a Corsair keyboard and mouse. These fit right in the mix.Good sound and range, work well with Icue software. I wear glasses so headsets don't sit well on my head for long periods. These are no exception. Not going to blame the headset. I wear glasses. Recommend.",
          "Lo compre de 2da mano y es un producto nuevo, ninguna queja",
          "Before all, make sure you're reading a review for the exact product you are buying, since Amazon tends to group reviews of similar products together.The Corsair Void elite RGB wireless are a great pair of headphones for their price, keep in mind they are not audiophile or enthusiast level and you'll see a lot of people trying to compare them to headphones of that level.That said, I've had no problems since unboxing them, you do have to do a little set up which requires ICUE software since the headphones firmware comes outdated out of the box, so make sure to install that, update them and then open the setting tab and adjust to your liking.The battery does last a full day on charge, they're really confortable once you get them set up for your head, it make take a couple of days to get the feel right but once you get them to where you like them they can stay on your head for a long time and you won't even feel them so make sure you sit down and adjust them, don't just throw them on your head as soon as you open the box.They fit perfectly over my ears and I consider them quite big, no issue there. The materials do feel premium, the only thing that it feels cheap is the little volume rocker on the back of the left headphone it does makes it up by being rather solid with no felt or audible wobble and it does serve various functions other than volume control (this wheel controls your actual PC volume, it's not separate which in my opinion is a plus, no more fumbling around trying to find if your headphones or your PC are outputting in low volume) for example, pressing it cycles through EQ profiles, holding it down toggles the 7.1 sound. The mic, features an auto shut off when the mic stick is lifted but if you want, there's also a button on the left headphone for mic shut off too, above that is the power button; the power up and pairing is rather quick so if you like turning it off when you feel you'll be away from your pc and don't need them is painless and quick, I had no issues connecting them to the USB dongle they come with, once I turned them on for the first time, they immediately synced to it.I will answer this question since I had it before buying them and could not find the answer easily, THEY INCLUDE THEIR OWN USB DONGLE FOR PAIRING WITH YOUR PC. It uses a proprietary connection so no bluetooth functionality make that of what you will, I find it excellent since when I built my PC I skipped any bluetooth including motherboards or dongles but for you it might be a big downside.Finally, the signal strength is great, I live in an all concrete house and it's able to penetrate a wooden door closet and a full concrete wall with no signal loss or audio distortion, further than that I do get a disconnect, but I'm able to walk up to my living room and keep the signal with a somewhat clear line of sight to my PC.",
          "Great headset! but for some reason the volume knob doesnt work for ps5, doesnt go up or down or maybe i just need some help..",
          "I bought this headset for Black Friday 2022 because it connects with some software I use. Headset worked fine for about a month and a half. Then it started emitting random bursts of static sounds and wasn't fully \"connected\" to the things I was using my headsets for (spotify, web browser, etc.)So I set up to get a replacement headset and sent back the faulty one. I open the replacement headset out of the box, and the static sounds are even worse than then other headset. It literally doesn't stop. They're literally unusable at the point cause it's constantly skipping out on the audio.I want to give Corsair a chance to troubleshoot this because they're a good company, but if I end up getting ANOTHER replacement and that one still doesn't work, I will move to a different manufacturer.",
          "Gave these as a gift, and the receiver was very thrilled.",
          "I've been using this for about a year and I'm mostly happy with it but there's a few things I wish I knew before buying it. Honestly I'd give it a 3.5 if I could but since I can't, I'm okay with rounding up.Good things:-Very comfy! I have a big head so it's hard for me to find over-ear headphones I actually enjoy wearing for long periods of time. I used an Arctis 7 before and while I thought that headset had a lot of good things going for it, it definitely got uncomfy after an hour or so. I can definitely keep the VOID on longer without issues.-Never had any complaints about mic quality.-Sound is solid. Nothing mind blowing but I can hear postional audio in games like Apex or Splitgate which is essential for a headset like this to me.-Wireless range is pretty good.The Not As Good:- Battery life is disappointing. I end up keeping a charger next to my PC because I end up having to charge it almost daily.- The swivel that lets you lift up the mic to mute it broke after a few months and will often slide back down. Probably not a huge deal for most people, but annoying. Wish I could just detach the mic if I wanted to.-No audio jack port like the Arctis 7, which was useful for when wanting two audio inputs at once like Discord on a PC and game audio from a Playstation.Overall, I'm mostly satisfied with it and I can recommend it, especially if you've found other wireless headsets to be uncomfortable. I'd just be aware of some of the quirks.",
          "My son says the work well and and say the range it good  walk away about 30 feet and still stayed connected",
          "The build quality is not great at all. I went through 3 of these already in 3 years. Wireless version has a horrible mic. But yes, they do break often. I had one where the ear cups joints broke. Then the second I had split right down the middle. I still buy these because they are pretty comfy and the mic is great. But this will be my last one. Next time I'm going to try out different companies. The QC is waaay off in Corsair.",
          "Comfort (5/5):  If you have a big head and / or ears this headset was designed for you.  The ear cups completely cover my long elf ears and doesn't cause any pressure on the side / top of my head even when wearing glasses.  The soft mesh cups don't get hot even after long sessions. They feel lightweight and study (Some metal but mostly plastic).  For me personally (Tall / thinner head with long elf ears) they fit great but they can feel loose compared to other headsets and can fall off when making extreme head movements.Sound Quality (5/5):  For a $99 headset these things sound amazing.  Surround sound is booming and doesn't feel washed out or distant.  EQ settings are bountiful and Bass Boost sounds deep.  They don't advertise any noise cancelling features but even without any sound output, they easily drown out my PC fans (which sits on my desk) and background noise in the next room over.Chat (5/5):  Chat quality is good.  Sidetone is clear and without static.  I would not use these as a primary Mic but for gaming they get the job done and I haven't had any complaints from my friends when listening to me while on discord.Software and Dongle (3/5):  I really want to like iCue (Corsairs software) but it can be troublesome.  Voice command prompts are an amazing feature: a voice will tell you what settings you have applied, when the mic is on or off, when surround sound is enabled and when battery level is low.  That is, it's amazing when it works.  The software can be buggy and some features can occasionally disable when turning the headset or PC on / off.  This isn't all the time but the occasional hiccup can be a headache.  The dongle is stupidly massive (why Corsair?) Distance is great.  I lose no signal / quality walking 30 steps away or playing on my TV the next room over from my PC.  EQ and RGB settings are plentiful.Battery (4/5):  Battery life is just Ok.  I get 10-12 hours (+surround sound and RGB off) before I get a low battery indicator.  I haven't tested them to empty but the advertised battery life is 16 hours.  RGB is a killer and will drain your battery incredibly quickly.  If you HAVE to have RGB on you might want to consider playing plugged into a power source.Overall: These are my favorite gaming / PC headphones.  I upgraded from a Void Pro Wired headset and the comfort and quality from Corsair has been outstandingly consistent.  The most comfortable over the ear headphones I have ever tried and for larger/longer heads and ears, no other brands have come close to such a great fit.  The sound is great (even the 7.1 surround sound which typically sounds like garbage on most headphones).  The software (iCue) and be troublesome at times but nothing deal breaking.  Overall, these are great headphones and the price of $99 make them amazing buy.My review score is weight based with Comfort and Quality weighing heavier than other features.",
          "Sound quality is good, highs and lows come through clearly and are crisp. I like the fabric on the ear muffs so my skin can breathe however this leads to less noise canceling, but I'll take the trade off. Battery life is as advertised, I get about 16 hours of use before recharging. I really like the auto mute function of just raising the mic boom. Overall I am very pleased.",

          "It\u2019s a pretty looking set of headgear but it comes with a lot of random issues that can only be helped by babying this device. My personal set won\u2019t charge unless it\u2019s sitting in \u201cjust the right position\u201d on my desk. I don\u2019t recommend wearing them while charging. That\u2019s how mine broke.But a coworker has the same pair at work and the left ear randomly gave out. Other than that it works fine.It just seems like a bit too problematic for how expensive these are. I was trying to get a solid pair for less than 200$ but I guess that\u2019s not these guys. Lol.",
          "Out of many headsets I have had in the past this headset has from what I have been told by many people a great sounding microphone, it may not be the best but its pretty great. The sound quality is something to get used to, and in the ICUE app you can actually change the headset between Stereo and 7.1 Surround. This headset has amazing noise cancellation, i can barely hear myself talk when im playing with others so if you live in a household with others be careful of talking too loud.1 Key flaw in the headset is the Battery life. It states that it has a 16 hour battery life but that is far from the truth. Because this headset has RGB on the sides, the color changing kills the batteries super fast and on a full charge you can get around 5-6 hours of game time. The only way to actually make this headset last from 10-16 hours is by turning off the RGB through the Corsair ICUE app, which im sure people would be okay with doing that since its not like you can actually see it while you're gaming.Other than that 1 flaw, the headset is great, its not as top heavy as people have said. They are super noise Cancelling, and the headband has a super long stretch fit, which helps a ton when you use them over a VR Headset.",
          "Overall, I love this headset. The sound is incredible and it's comfortable to wear for long periods. It's not a noise cancelling headset by design, but  when wearing it, the cups do cover all the way around the ears and when you've got them on and your listening to something, it's extremely difficult to hear anything outside of them. I do have one con for this and that's for the battery life. If you use the RGB function, even though it's just a little insignia for Corsair, it really hurts the battery life. After more time, this gets worse. I've had these for a year now and I have to keep the RGB lights off and the battery still only lasts a few hours. You can charge it while using it but that defeats the purpose of a wireless headset. Even with that issue, I would highly recommend this headset. It sounds wonderful and the mic is crystal clear",
          "I purchased these to replace a wired Astro A40 headset that I'd had for about 8-10 years and the wires were starting to give out, causing audio loss and sensitivity to movement. I had read several negative reviews on here about audio quality, the fit on the head, customization, and software complaints. To be honest, aside from the fit on the head, the rest seems a bit excessive.First for audio quality I give it a 10/10. It's great, and a noticeable improvement from what I had before. They also are able to produce spatial audio, where you can get omnidirectional sound (if that makes sense). For example, a sound meant to come from the front/right side will sound like it comes from there as opposed to something from your back/left side. The ICUE software settings for the headphones are simple to understand and the EQ options can be changed to your liking (my favorite so far is the Movie one). I have listened to music and an ASMR video just to test it out, and I can say the audio is amazing. The bass is powerful but not overbearing, and seeing as I prefer heavy metal music, the vocals not being drowned out by the music is no problem here for this headset. It is comparable to the Bose system I have in my vehicle, and that's saying a lot.The fit on the head is the one thing I could agree with on some level. It is adjustable, on both the left and right sides - however it is not a super snug fit, at least not on my head. If I were to lean forward to bend down to pick something off the floor, they probably will start to slide but not fall off completely. So, not sure where people were saying otherwise, but hey, everyone has a different shaped head, etc.The comments about not being able to customize the RGB effects, not sure about where those came from either. The ICUE software allows you to change them to your liking, whether on/off or specific patterns and/or color effects. Pretty easy to understand. The only thing I wish they had is that when they headset is plugged in and charging, it merely shows the charging symbol without a current percentage number (unless I missed a setting) which I'd like to know.Overall, if you're looking for a new headset or an upgrade, and this product fits within your price budget, go for it. I have not been disappointed and I have been thoroughly impressed in the time I've had them so far.",
          "when I first got the headset the audio was left to be desirable but went into my settings and did some digging to change the audio out side of normal means. the mic flip to mute was nice at first but after about a month it kept falling down and would unmute the mouth piece cover kept falling off. but over all a great headset and excellent noise cancelling tech. I do like the wireless ability just wish range was slightly more. oh and very comfortable on my head",
          "The style of this headphone is the only one that doesn't hurt my ears. I could games for hours at a time and not mind wearing them. Round headphones push on my ears; my ears aren't large, but they are \"tall\".My first pair of these headphones fit a little loose which I prefer. This second pair is a little tighter on my cheekbones which is a bit annoying.",
          "the Void Elite wired is REALLY comfortable, like, barely can tell its on my head. there's no clamping in the ears, the cups fit over them perfectly, no sweating or heat buildup in the ears, headband is padded well, mic is sleek and clear sounding to everyone I've tested it with as its fresh out of the box and replacing a cheap mic headset I got for free. Construction looks and feels solid, plastic feels nice, adjustment for the band clicks solidly, it sits nicely and securely on my head as well.Surround Sound on games with the proper settings performs as advertised, and sounds pretty good.The Negatives:Having said all that, unboxing the unit it looked like a man had shaved over it. There were, to the best of my identification, stubble hairs on the box and inside of it. Does this mean it was a return? Shoddily boxed at the factory by an unwashed worker? Seals were all intact, no blemishes I could find on the unit, all protective plastics and twist ties present and looking factory.The Surround Sound is pretty meh with music. It still sounds better than stereo setting in the iCue software using the usb dongle, but id put it at where you'd expect a kinda alright headset to sound like off the bat, and im not really an audiophile stat queen.The Bass in these is absolutely terrible for music, and really meh in games, if you want to be *very* charitable and call it bass. The bass boost preset in iCue barely does anything, and my motherboard has built in DAC's built for pushing out serious sound (my PC *is* built like a stat queen). Using only the 3.5mm jack in the DAC ports produces even less bass, which is pretty head scratching as the outputs are made for it without the use of a dongle. My desktop 7.1 surround sound system absolutely bangs using these 3.5mm ports, as do my other headsets.I didn't buy the headset for playing music, but with an advertised large driver, I was expecting something on par with non-mic'd headphones. My Sony MDR-XB450 headset sounds way more amazing, almost like it has surround sound and powerful bass without a USB dongle and without EQ/software modifications.Mic flip-to-mute works, but there's no indication light that turns red when muted, either flipped up, manually muted on the headset itself, or through software (OS, Webex, Steam, etc) I've checked the product listing, and this specific listing does not mention the mute light, whereas on the wireless RBG it does. The mic boom definitely has the led lighting section in it right before the pickup, so I dont know if its a miss in the manufacturing or if its just not included in this specific non-RGB product. It seems like it would be a base feature for all units, especially if they're going to the trouble of manufacturing the boom with the indicator section. Who knows, maybe its cheaper to have the single tooling and manufacture process and just not hook it up.I've noted that after about an hours worth of use, taking off the headset, the very tall foam padding on the inside of the band seems to be slanted towards the back of the headset. This will likely mean that the foam will eventually twist within the mesh covering it, and not sit nicely within the headset band. More time will tell, and I will be keeping an eye on it during the return window for this and the other above concerns.Bottom Line:This headset will be more than sufficient for lengthy work conference calls because of its comfort, clarity and mic, but will really lack when there's in-game music, explosions or other sounds on the low-end. Top and mids sound crystal clear. Voice is delivering as advertised, clear and precise. Maybe I just got a bad headset like many of the reviews? The lack of low end sounds is really disappointing even if I was not using it for music, it is a gaming headset and games use a very wide range of sounds, it seems like the bass missing is a big \"Swing and a miss\" on Corsair's part, even if the headset was only $60 at the time of writing.",
          "Bought this headset a year ago and it just stopped working. I mean it was great while it lasted but kinda was expecting more than a year of use since I am a casual player and probably only clock a few hours a week on it. I take good care of my electronics too so its not like it was setting in a pile of cheeto dust either.I am disappointed to say the least...Update: I got it working don't know what it was possibly a bad charging cable. Changed the review other than that the headset is good.",
          "This headset was recently purchased for streaming and other uses such as work. I love the ergonomics of the headset but it does have some nuances that will need to make this head set run properly and at its optimal settings for Windows 10.If you're hearing feedback from your mic:This is the \"Sidetone\" listed inthe ICue program from Corsair's website. You can deactivate this by sliding the bar down for it in the program to 0 or you can press and hold the mute button for 5 seconds and it'll switch between it being on or off depending on your preference (some people like it on for streams).If you're wondering why does the sound sound like you're listening to the audio with your ear in a cardboard tube:This is audio dropoff from possible multiple reasons depending on your set up.1: check to make sure Windows Spatial (Windows Sonic for headphones) IS enabled.2: make sure the audio output in the window sound settings is not on Nvida Broadcast (AKA RTX voice) and is on the Corsair headset option instead. It would be wise to turn off all options for speakers on Nvida Broadcast for using this headset. You can still use it for the mic however.3: double check you have the latest firmware on your headset. It's done through the ICUE app on Corsair's website.The noise canceling is decent but that's due to the design. The ear cups cover the entire ear (going around the ear unless you have elephant ears). The mesh muffs are quite nice for breathability and keep the heat down. There is some pressure on the head from the headset's weight and the headset pushing a little hard fresh out of the box on pressure points around the ear but those will go away after good use and \"stretching out\" the headset to a more worn in feel (don't try to stretch out the band yourself just let it happen naturally).The worst parts to this product are not related to the product:Windows spatial doesn't have an equalizer. For audiophiles, this is kinda a let down, but again this isn't corsair's fault. The stock one in ICUE isn't the best either... which is their fault.The dongle is pretty chonky but seems durable to a point. Wouldn't recommend pulling it out often if you have too.Good headset and after doing the changes to get the audio to work, it's a decent wireless headset for the price of 60. Go for it but don't expect absolute perfection from it... 8.5/10",
          "I wear glasses, and this is the first set of headphones I found that doesn\u2019t hurt my ears. They are comfortable, the sound is great, and the buttons are easy to reach.",
          "I got this to replace my old headset and I couldn't be happier! My only complaint is the charging. For whatever reason, it only charges to 90% when it's powered off. Not the biggest issue in the world, but an issue nonetheless.There's also a few other things that, while I personally don't have issues with, some people might. - Mesh ear pads are very comfortable (easily one of the most comfortable and breathable headsets I've ever used), but offer basically no sound absorption, meaning you'll be able to hear basically any sound outside of the headset. - The 7.1 Surround Sound is good, but it takes a while to get use to it if you're use to other 7.1 surround headsets. - The software is, like most software from gaming hardware manufactures, weird and sometimes glitchy(although much better than most other lighting / sound controlling software I've used for other hardware I have). - The mechanism for expanding or shortening the length of the headset can, on occasion, get your hair stuck in it. I have medium length hair (longer than most guys I see), so it may affect me more than other people. Nothing dramatic, but it seems like a \"style over function\" design. - It doesn't use USB-C. This one actually bugs me a bit, since almost everything else on the planet (except Apple, and even that is changing) uses USB-C.  Why would you use a cord (USB Type B Micro) that is basically only used by cheap  consumer products nowadays? (Yes, I know this type of cord is used in some very expensive stuff like some drones and other devises where locking the cord in place is very important, but a USB-C cord should work in this situation no problem). Again, not the biggest complaint, but I've had so many of those cords fail on my in the past that I'm almost afraid to use Type B Micro cords more than I need to. I'd happily pay $5 more for a USB-C model. - Lastly, the gloss finish over the lighting elements, while looking very nice, attract figure prints like you wouldn't believe. I thought I should point that out since, if you're getting the RGB variant, you probably care about stuff like that.",
          "This headset sounds better than my speakers, and so has been perfect for gaming",

          "Ok so we have tried others like the Razer Kraken and were so disappointed by the battery charging issues and it not connecting. This corsair headset just works and stays charged and charges without issue. The sound is amazing with Dolby and DTS compatability. The attenuation to allow outside sounds to feed back into the headset through the microphone is perfect so you can hear your wife or mom calling you. When it is off you get nothing but pure game sound. It is lightweight and does not hurt your ears with prolonged use. I own 6 of these for my tech team at work for a call center and they just work. The only con is the USB mini jack as always is fragile. The other nice part is the steel construction for the arms going over your head makes it unbeatable for durability. If Corsair up graded the charging port to usb C, I would buy me a new pair.",
          "Working from home and sitting down at a desk all day is exhausting and this headset has made My job so much easier especially with having little ones while working they can\u2019t hear the background noise just the sound of my voice as well as when putting the mic up it goes into mute automatically highly recommend",
          "todo espectacular lo recomiendo totalmente",
          "Had a SADES 902 headset for 3+ years and loved it but the time was approaching for me to get a new headset. My laptop has Corsair iCue built in so I figured why not go for some more Corsair peripherals and sync them up. After having the Corsair Void Elite for a few days I figured I could safely give it an initial review.the Sound Quality is great, sounds are crystal clear and after putting it through some audio tests it seems to have held up well. The bass is low and the trebles are clear without static as well as the 7.1 surround being apparent HOWEVER this was only achieved after enabling Windows Sonic instead of the Corsair software within iCue. Idk what the software does to make the audio come out so garbled but that's what my experience was with the presets that came preloaded with the headphones. Windows Sonic or Dolby Atmos takes care of that.The build is beautiful, it's extremely comfy and the weight is well distributed around the head. The ear muffs are soft but firm and I have used them for class for 7+ hours straight as well as gaming and I get no headaches or anything like that. My only problem is mine came with some scratches on the mic arm. The corsair logos glowing on the side is a nice touch as well as an expected one from Corsair.Features on this headset include a mute button on the left ear with a volume knob below that, and when the mic is up is it auto-muted, a feature that is excellent for MS Teams. The Black version is fairly long cable, ~6 feet ending with a 3.5\" headphone jack that works with your phone or Mac with an adapter for USB 7.1 surround on PC. I live on a military base and could still hear the bugle play even gaming at 50% volume in a firefight on Borderlands 3 so noise cancellation is pretty subpar but the muffs also don't fully cover under my ears, allowing sound to travel in.Mic quality is slightly better than my SADES headset in terms of sensitivity to external noise and the inclusion of the wind reducer piece for the mic end is nice, it reduces breathing sounds and even \"pop\" filters a little bit. Again, flipping the mic up will mute and the range for this is very forgiving, as it doesn't have to be all the way up, you have about 2 inches of wiggle room.Hope this review helped.",
          "I have had two pairs of Corsair Void Wireless headphones. The first pair I got several years ago and it experienced a similar failure to this. However, at the time, I blamed myself for the failure because I was using the non-included cord and an ASRock motherboard.But yet, here we are: I got this pair of headphones in 2020 and they worked well until the day before last night when I decided to plug them in: I felt the microusb port not set in right and I was like \"oh thats not good\"- I turned on my light to find that it had melted and experienced the exact same failure as my other pair.I am unsure what design with the headphones is responsible for this: I would imagine the charging circuit not having proper safety mechanisms / charging port. Corsair should adopt some sort of safety device to prevent this failure- or just move to Type C charging. I feel like this failure wouldn't have happened if it was Type C (the connector is more current resistant.The first set I had that failed was much more big of a deal, as I was wearing them when it melted suddenly and it almost burnt me. I remember rushing it all to the bath tub. The damage was much worse (I will update if I somehow find a photo of it).Either way: both of these pairs are in the trash now... and I have purchased wired, studio grade headphones.Apart from this issue though: the voids are extremely comfortable and sound great (to my untrained ears). They're good value. The microphone quality/levels could def be improved though. I enjoy the overall design of things- except the melting part. Especially the cloth earcups!",
          "Okay",
          "We have all had really terrible headset mics. Either the headset itself is uncomfortable, tinny, or breaks if you look at it funny, or the mic has you sounding like a WW2 dispatch officer. This is not those headphones.If you call yourself an audiophile, or need something with studio quality noise, I do not recommend this, and for that it loses a star in sound quality. Its certainly far from awful, and frankly I feel most people will experience nothing but good things coming from this headset. You should NOT be expecting audiophile quality at this price point, so this is not why I chose 4 out of five stars overall.First off, these headphones are pretty balanced as far as low to high frequencies, while not being extremely good at either. This DOES mean it gives you better sound quality, and so long as you mix correctly on your end, you will experience the details of whatever you are trying to listen to. At its maximum, its definitely not as loud as some headsets I have had, but I have never struggled to get a louder sound from these during normal use (gaming, movies, or music)These are not active noise canceling headphones, but the ear cushions are a comfortable and snug size that don't fit extremely tight (more on that in a bit) so it does about what I'd expect from a standard over-ear headset would insofar as noise canceling goes. You're not gonna shut off the world with these, but you will turn it far enough down to enjoy whatever you need to enjoy.The advertised 7.1 surround sound capability is a virtual one (so it doesn't have those special quad drivers or whatever) and it works pretty well when configured correctly, certainly enough to pinpoint directions of noise in games. For people who struggle to test virtual surround sound, try turning your headphones backwards for a bit. You'd be surprised how you can sort of reset your senses this way. Be sure to turn them the right way though or you'll be having a very confused time lol.The input quality (mic) is pretty good, and unlike with other headsets I have had, it filters out white noises and extraneous noises pretty well (as well as breathing and typing noises, the bane of headset mics the world over) which probably has a lot to do with both the windscreen that comes with it and my first complaint about the product.The mic is rigid and only folds up from a joint connected to your left ear speaker. This seemed fine, at first, until my own voice sometimes was too quiet in game chats or didn't always pick up when I have \"detect voice\" settings on. This can likely be fixed if I tune everything correctly individually and I have made an effort, but since this is not always the case with headsets and removing the windscreen only made it pick up more external noises, I'm including it in my complaints. Either its too far from my mouth hole or not sensitive enough, but its an occasional hassle to be wary of. At least I'm not blowing out my friend's ears when the game gets intense.Beyond that, I have some friends using Yeti and other stand mics who sound far worse than I do, which is likely because that havent spent the few hours needed to tweak and test their own settings. You will likely not have to do that for this, outside of quick adjustments for your own output volume.My second and final complaint is that these are definitely made for bigger heads. I don't have a small head by any means, so take me at my word that these will fit over hats, big hair, or just a big old noggin. I often feel it getting loose and try to tighten it (which is easy enough, btw) only to find that at its tightest it angles the ear pieces slightly, while not fitting as snug as I would like. I am likely used to headphones with higher tension in the band than these, but it should be noted. As implied before, these can also struggle to keep the size you set it at, but considering how little labor is required to fix it, its not a huge complaint.Its managing software is pretty unobtrusive and easy to use, and its much better than Razer and other accessory softwares I've been forced to deal with.Its Corsair, so the quality is pretty good and its taken a decent amount of stress since I've gotten it, as I can be reckless with my accessories. It also has a good looking design that isn't blasted with Gamer lights so if you appreciate sleek appliances with a touch of flair then these are perfect. The have adjustable lights with the corsair logo that you can turn off, flash, change colors, or keep on. The standard light options.tl;dr at this price point this is the best pair of headphones I have had for casual use. With only minor complaints I would happily buy this model again rather than taking a risk on another pair of similar price. If you want extremely high sound quality, you're going to have to spend more than this, but for most people this will be high tier.",
          "Before reading this review you should be aware of two fundamental facts: I am a PS5 user and I have a big head as well as thick hair.My hunt for the perfect PS5 headset continues, and most recently brought me to this headset after much research (Sidenote: I need to stop taking Reddit recommendations seriously). I thought I'd finally found \"The One,\" sadly I was mistaken.On design alone I'd give it 5 stars, no question. It's a beautiful headset and the white is a perfect complement to my PS5. I love the RGB lights even if they do eat up battery. It does not look or feel like a <$100 headset, it looks much fancier than my old Turtle Beach (first gen Stealth 600). The default noise cancelling is good, as soon as I put it on the background noise in my apartment seemed dull and far away. Unfortunately the positives end there.Now the bad stuff. PS5 users CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ICUE. Which means you can't tweak settings in it. Technically you can access iCue from your computer and even change settings, these settings will all reset to default the minute you remove the dongle from your computer. So there is no sidetone which is something I specifically wanted.#2 issue: as previously mentioned, I have a large head. The headset was initially very comfortable, I love that the cups have good swivel on them and how they sit on my ears. But I wear glasses and have several upper ear piercings, within an hour or two of use this headset got real annoying, real fast. Removing my glasses fixed this but then I couldn't see soooo...#3 issue: because the volume roller on the cup doesn't work with PS5, you are limited to just the PS5 settings and even on max volume this headset was not very loud. Despite this the sound was good and my friend I game with said that the mic sounded \"very professional\" so those are both positives but as an old lady who went to way too many concerts in the 90s I need more volume. Boo.I also noticed that in a couple hours of use I went from full charge to under 60%. I assume this is because the RGB is always going and again, you can't turn this off in iCue if you are on PS.I'll be returning this one, though I wish I didn't have to because I really, really wanted to like it. I bet it's fabulous if you are on PC, alas I am a lowly console scrub. Ah well, off to try something else.",

The second thing to look out for is the flip mic is only good for about a year, it still sounds crisp but it becomes too lose to hold position.

The largest issue I've had is with the quality of the mic. Because it's detachable from the headset the connection easily comes loose and I've had multiple complaints from co-workers and guild-mates that I'm giving off a ton of static.

Great sound love the detachable mic feature. Also love the headset colume and mute is all on the headset its self unlike others having it on the cord.  Love how universal it is. The audio is extremely good for the price point",
          "First off let's address \"mic bleeding\" many reviewers have claimed.  That means when the mic is muted, this headset is alleged to bleed output sound into the mic stream. I tested this with loud sound and miccheck.me recordings and did not find that to be happening. Physical mic mute by rotating the mic upward works properly.These have the best integrated mic I've heard on a gaming headset.  The range, fullness and noise level are all very good.The comfort is excellent for large ears as the cones surround the ear completely , with no pressure on the ear itself.Sound quality is very good. I tested with RDR2 on Xbox and many more subtle & spatial sounds work.  Music & movie sound quality is also good \u2013 a balanced but not reference-quality sound.Build quality is high for the price, a metal frame and detents for sizing.Overall a great value at $40 and even up to $75",
          "So how do these compare to my $20 Chinese headset? A bit better I guess. The sound quality is good. They are comfortable, but my one big complaint is that the \"leather\" earcup material keeps coming loose. hard to explain but the earcup material keeps coming out of where it tucks into the hard plastic. I use a spudger to tuck it back in but that only lasts a few months. if it weren't for that one little thing I would highly recommend  this headset at the price I bought it for. Half of a hundred dollars.",

          "*Update to my earlier review, this headset broke on me today. As I stated is a common occurrence in my main review, the headset randomly stopped working on me today and I figured I'd just unplug and reconnect it to its USB port because that usually fixes the issue for a few hours. This time it did not work, instead I heard very scratchy, garbled audio and the mic was not working. I checked the playback device menu and instead of CORSAIR HEADSET, the headset is now being displayed as CONEXANT USB AUDIO. The headset is no-longer recognized by Corsair's iCUE software so I can't try to update drivers from there, restarting my PC did nothing, and my PC says there are no driver updates for this device. Even after uninstalling the device and its drivers and reinstalling everything, it still shows as CONEXANT AUDIO DEVICE, so looks like I'm out almost $50 in only 3 months. If you are reading this, the best thing I can recommend to you is to seriously consider another brand. I have bought many corsair products (capture cards, software, other hardware/accessories) in the past and it's often a toss up as to if the product you receive will work correctly without having to exchange it for another. I would have to recommend another brand, at least for headsets. If I had to drive one final point home, it would be DON'T BE DISTRACTED BY CORSAIR'S SLEEK PRODUCT LOOKS, OFTEN TIMES THE PRODUCT QUALITY JUST ISN'T THERE AND PEOPLE OVERLOOK THIS BECAUSE THEY LOOK COOLER THAN MANY COMPETATORS PRODUCTS.So I got these because I had been using a cheap $35 gaming headset and wanted something a bit higher quality, and since about 60% of my PC was using Corsair parts already (that I was very pleased with) I decided to go with these since they seemed to be a nice, stylish gaming headset.But after receiving them and using them for a few months now, I have to say they were underwhelming from what I was hoping for.The first thing I noticed was that the high-end (and overall treble for the most part) actually sounded less crisp, almost slightly muffled compared to my previous headset. Bullet cracks in one game I frequent, for example, sounded loud and crisp on my old headset but sounded almost distant in comparison on the Corsairs. I thought maybe the treble was just low, so I went and checked but it was as high as it could go. Took some getting used to but after only wearing the corsairs for a while, I adjusted to it and forgot the difference, but just knowing it was there kinda stunk. The speakers also have a faint but distinct hiss at the higher volume levels, but the bass has a good range and rumble to it though, so that's nice. The earcups are pretty good at noise cancellation but they don't breathe very well and I sometimes find my ear area getting sweaty underneath if it gets warm/hot in my room.The second thing I was bummed about, was that the mic quality seems to somehow be worse than the cheap chinese headset I had been using. When I got the headset, I asked my friends over discord to listen to my voice and then quickly started using the corsair headset and asked them what their thoughts were on the difference. All but one of them said they thought I sounded worse. It wasn't a 'bad' mind you, but they all agreed I sounded more artificial, or just lower quality in general than I had with the old headset.The last thing, and the one that really made me just shake my head, is that this headset will randomly just shut off, or lose power, or disconnect - I'm not sure which it is. All that I am sure of, is that *at least* once daily (if I'm using them for ~4 hours or more) I will be playing a game or listening to youtube, ect. and suddenly the sound will cut out and my PC will no longer see the headset in the sound settings. The only way to fix it is by reaching down to my PC, unplugging and re-plugging it into the USB port. It doesn't happen super often, but it happens enough that I start to get pretty frustrated when I'm risking death in a game because I suddenly can't hear anything or speak to anyone for ~10 seconds while I fix it and wait for it to reconnect to my PC. Sometimes it happens hours apart, sometimes 10 mins. I've used multiple headsets in that same USB slot and never had any disconnecting issues so I'm 99.99% positive it's not the USB port.Because of this issue alone, I would have returned this headset and maybe tried to get a different model or maybe even different brand, but my dog destroyed the product box shortly after receiving it so I guess I'm just going to use what I have.",
          "\u2705I have a logi540 headset also and my ears were hurting! These ones are way, way more comfortable! Finally some relief!\u2705They are not noise cancelling, just noise reducing.\u2705For Home office, I preferred to have the button to mute the mic, perhaps that was something I did not check. This one you have to pull up the mic, which is cool, although not that good for frequent use.\u2705If you have long puffy hair, it's good to use a cap or something on the hair because it gets messy!\u2705FYI: The usb-mini jack addon configuration causes issues for voip calls, you need to get Nvidia broadcast to prevent disconnections or strange behaviors on calls!I use them ALL day, and once wearing a cap I feel no discomfort at all! All day means 8-12 hours!!!There are nice equalizer options available in ICue.Regarding sound quality, I am no expert, and I was wondering what difference it would make.I played Fallout 4, there was no noticeable difference. Then, I played Skyrim and yes! The surround audio kicked in and it was much more... Atmospheric? I guess it depends on the game?Music and movies are also good! And more importantly, very, very comfortable \ud83d\ude2c",
          "I like the fit and finish of the headset. Feels sturdy and like it will last. Audio sounds decent out the box. Would definitely set up an Dolby eq if you're on console. Headset sounds pretty flat so I boosted the bass and raised the highs. Also I wear glasses and had no discomfort from the ear cushions. Mic sounds good too, a little but on the quiet side but not bad. Friends say it sounds better than my razer blackshark Overall pretty good headset.",
          "-Literally studio quality headphones-With an crisp clear quality mic-FIVE STARS for everything!-Get it while it is $50!!!Here's how to get the best possible settings on PC:-Download iCUE and Nvidia Broadcast (if you have a Nvidia card)-Turn on Dolby!-Do the Corsair Sound Test ID-Adjust Settings in iCUE to your taste-Go to PC Sound Settings > Output Settings > Format to 24bit, 98000 Hz...Literal studio quality, THIS HEADSET--HS 65 offers studio quality!!! And it's on par with a few of my iems and studio headphones too! (Sound profile for me, when adjusted sounds like my Moondrop Chu, (a $20 iem but an amazing $20 iem) but BETTER, no harshness or sibilance. No audio equalizer needed.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HEADSET!!!I used to use Razer and Sennheiser for gaming. While Razer headsets are lightweight and have a decent mic, they suck in terms of anything audio EVEN with their added 7.1 surround sound. Sennheiser was just too neutral for my usual taste (in gaming), though I still use them for music. With the HS65, you can adjust everything to your taste! Did I mention it's studio quality too? I think I did that like thrice. Anyway, audiophiles will love this headset. Me rn. I don't even have to use my equalizer, it basically comes with everything already.",
          "This is a GREAT set of headsphones for the price. Very comfortable and great sound paired with Corsair's software for customization of sound EQ.BUT there is a sound card that is connected by USD into your PC. You plug in your 3 band 3.5 mm jack into the sound card which is how digital sound gets interpreted into analog for your headset and processes inputs from your mic.Somewhere inside this sound card, there is an issue where the inputs from your PC sound (for example, if you were listening to music) are misinterpreted as mic inputs from your headset and can be heard by people you are talking with in a virtual hangout like Discord.While it may not cause you any problems, it causes many disruptions for people I talk with. I don't have any sounds going on during a Teams call at work, but I'd guess it could happen there as well.To fix the sound card issue, get rid of it and get a 3.5 mm jack splitter that will separate the headphone speaker and the microphone. Then plug both directly into your PC. I think by doing this, you lose the ability to listen with the 7.1 Surround sound which is a bummer.",
          "I\u2019ve owned dozens of premium and budget headphones, and I find that this headset lands somewhere in the middle \ufffcof those two categories.Build quality 3/5These headphones feel pretty sturdy. It has an adjustable metal headband, but the rest is made out of this soft-feeling plastic. Compared to some of its competitors in this price range (like Logitech\u2019s G433 gaming headset), it feels better built.The audio quality 3/5While audio quality can be pretty subjective, as some people prefer a sound with heavy bass, the audio should be good enough for most people. For me, the treble in this headset is slightly underwhelming for music. For gaming, however, the mid-range shines through, and the sound stage is excellent for hearing the directions of footsteps in-game.Mic quality 4.5 /5This has an excellent mic. Not much to say here; for the price, I\u2019m not sure you can do much better. \ufffc\ufffcComfort 3/5I think for most head sizes, this will be a very comfortable headset. \ufffc\ufffcYou shouldn\u2019t have any issues with ear fatigue after wearing them for hoursConclusionIn 2022 this is one of the best wired-gaming headsets on the market. Would I pay full retail (80 US dollars) for them? No, you should be buying these for around $65. I really enjoy this headset, but for $80, I think the price-to-performance isn\u2019t on par with some of its competitors. With that said, if these are on sale, buy them. You\u2019re not going to do much better at this price range.",
          "I got these as a replacement for my previous Corsair VOID Elite headset that broke due to user error and I gotta say that this is an upgrade. These stay on my head much better, have better sound quality overall, and have better build quality.Sound quality is important to me and I have a background in audio engineering. The drivers in this headset are a little muddy out of the box, but the Corsair iCUE software can help with EQ and smooth it out. They sound warm and smooth. They're not $200 headphones by any means, but they are a good deal for the price.The microphone can be described as XBox Live chat quality from the 2010s according to a friend on Discord, but that's not all that important to me because I'm not looking for amazing mic quality here. I have an external mic for higher quality sound if I need it. Picks up my voice fine.The one complaint I have is the braided cable, but it's just my own quip; the texture is scratchy and makes abrasive sounds when rubbing against my clothes that transfers itself through the cable and into my ears. Mildly annoying when nothing is coming through the headset, but when I'm gaming or listening to music it's not noticeable.Overall it's one of the best headsets I've had at this price point, period, if not the best of them all. Here's my stamp of approval.",
          "After trying many headphones, I found a keeper. I love the way they fit around my ears and the sound is great. I mic works well and I like that it\u2019s detachable. The noise canceling feature is another plus. I also really like how well-made it feels. You can tell it\u2019s made of quality. They only criticism is that it hurts the top of my head after about 20 minutes. I\u2019ve tried to adjust the size, but nothing works. It\u2019s  annoying, but I\u2019m willing to stick with them.",
          "This was a W upgrade imo because I wore some 10 dollar gaming headset and this was a huge upgrade \ud83d\udcaf",
          "Meet expectations",
          "How much do I like these? I bought them as a gift for my spouse based upon the reviews and the brand's reputation, but I had not tried them. When they arrived, I gave them a try. Holy smokes. I deeply regretted that I don't care about myself enough to buy quality headsets for myself; I have been denying myself life's little pleasures all of these years by buying cheap, off-brand headsets. A whole existential crisis occurred and I emerged from it with a vision of the world I had not previously possessed.That said, these are not much more expensive than the cheap ones I had been buying since I would end up getting a replacement set when the cheap ones wore out. I'm also sure that there are even better headsets out there, but the difference between these and the \"budget\" ones I always bought is tangible.So then, what is the difference? The sound quality, for one. The sound is rich, crisp and clear. There is depth and dimension to it that the budget headsets I've used lack. At the same volume as I normally use, I can pick up little detail sounds in my games that I had previously not heard. Definitely a more immersive experience. The sound is also well-balanced between the right and left ears. No more fumbling about with cables to try to get the jack in just the right way to keep one ear from hearing nothing (also, now that I'm typing this, that sounds like a weirdly specific problem, but I digress).The fit on the headset is good, too. Maybe a little tight over the ears, but not something that distracts me. Plus, the earcups are soft and that helps a lot. The headband is great with excellent padding. Could be a little lighter, but overall, it's quite comfortable.The microphone quality is good. I've heard my spouse talking through it on a game we play, and it was an improvement over his last headset. I like that the mic comes with a little foam cover to help keep down incidental noises that interfere with the voice quality.As for the price, I paid full price for the one I bought my spouse since it was a gift. But I saw it was on sale several months later and very heavily hinted that it would be a great time to buy a birthday gift for me. My spouse gets hints, and I now have a very nice headset. All of that is to say that the price on this headset fluctuates, so you might be able to score a set for only a little more than some of the budget headsets.To sum up: very good sound, solidly comfortable, very good mic, reasonably priced. I'm very happy with this purchase, even if it did involve a crisis exploration of the metaphysics of existence.",
          "While working from home, my Logitech on-ear headset was beginning to cause rashes on my ears from hours of continuous use.  To be fair, the maybe 2 hours of day they were used pre-pandemic when I was working in the office was fine.  However, the 8 to sometimes 12 hours a day was not working.  I wanted to find an over the ear headset but didn't want to invest too much into some of the game headsets.  I already have two Sennheiser gaming headsets which fill their role but are on the expensive side.The Corsair HS60 is a good set of headphones, especially if you can pick them up on an Amazon sale.  I have a relatively small head and the headset fits snug.  The top is padded but it can start to bug you if you are wearing the headset for many hours straight (and you have little to no hair for cushion).  You can adjust it so it's not resting on your head but then the headset will lean forwards or backwards which you will feel around your ears.  I've had extended days of working and have worn the headset for almost 10-11 hours in a day.  Not continuously, but total and have had very little discomfort.The sound quality is really good for the price (on sale).  No, it's not going to beat an expensive Sennheiser set, but it does not disappoint with sound quality.  I'm an avid music fan and have not been unhappy with the quality.  Keep in mind, this might vary depending on what you are using to drive the headphones.  If you have an elaborate Schiit system or something higher end, look at higher end headphones.  For normal computer and/or soundcard output, the headphones do really well and have a good range.The mic is another topic.  As you can see from the pictures, the mic is not a boom mic.  It is optional to use and plugs into the headset with a 3.5mm connector.  The headset does not echo your mic through the headset.  Also, these are a close back headset.  This means you can't really hear yourself taking and sometimes has you yelling into the mic to hear yourself through the close back headset.  The other thing is that the mic reads extremely quiet in Windows.  I did some searching through online forums and found this to be common.  Even with the mic cranked to the maximum in Windows, it still reads low when you talk.  The good thing is that I haven't had any complaints of co-workers not hearing me but it does make you feel like you need to speak louder.Since the mic isn't a boom mic, you can't just swing it out of the way.  You can bend it out of the way of your mouth (if you are eating or drinking) but you can't really get it out of your viewing area which may bug you.  Next, when you lay down the headset, since the mic isn't a boom mic it's a little awkward.  If you lay it forward, you have to bend the mic back.  If you lay it backwards, you will move the dial on the back for volume.  If you have a headset stand, then it doesn't matter.The volume dial, this is likely the weakest part of the headset.  The volume dial is extremely easy to accidently move.  The last complaint is the USB cord.  I believe it's got a nylon coating which means it's forever tangled.  I've had similar cords before on other devices and trying to untangle and keep them untangled typically does more damage than good to the cord.  I wonder if some of the reviews complaining about the cord breaking were trying to keep it untangled.Overall, for the money (on sale), it's a good product.  Don't expect $200+ headset quality for $50 (or whatever the current sale price).  I do think at $100, there are some other options out there but at $60 or less, these are good to have in your consideration.",
          "good sound quality , hugs ears, durably made.I've had several headphones break from minor drops off table height, these seem to have lasted longer than all others.",
          "Mic and sound quality are very good. The headset however can be a bit finicky (do NOT toss the converter dongle), you may need to try a couple different connection configurations before both sound and mic work well. Also pretty heavy for a wired headset. Quality and hardware are very good though definitely pleased.",
          "The only reason I don't give it a 5 rating is I am a big guy(6'7\" 250pnds) and it pinches my head and makes long use uncomfortable.  I have to switch to my Sony ON THE EAR headphones when not needing to communicating with folks!",
          "love the audio and comfortable fit, but after a few months the dongle wasn't being read. First my rgb Void headset now my hs60 pros. its a shame, I truly love corsair.. everything including my chair is corsair, still a supporter, cheers.",
          "10/20 update, the sound is fantastic. The surround sound on pc is great and really makes the movie watching and gaming more immersive! Although the surround sound is not applicable on ps4, the sound is still great. I can identify exactly where the sound comes from when I'm playing Ghost of Tsushima.------Okay, just to be clear, I'm not a fan of Razer or Corsair. I just bought my first razer headset a few days ago, the Kraken tournament edition (Prime's Day price was just 50$). And after I received the headset, I found the sound was fine, not so great but acceptable. But I couldn't get my mic work, and also, the razer software just kept failing to start. I had to return that. Luckily I found this corsair one was still on sale, also 50$, and then I decided to give it a shot.It's way better than the Kraken one...- Surround SoundHs60 pro and Kraken both have 7.1 virtual surround sound. I'll say hs60 is better. The Kranken one's surround sound is kind of blurring, and I found my left side was obviously quieter than the right side, and I couldn't adjust (the headset was not defective. The issue was related to the software). Hs60's surround is more recognizable. Because I tested it by watching Marvel's Avenger movie. When the aircraft is flying by, I was amazed a little by the surround sound.- General soundRegardless of the surround sound, I'll say hs60 and Kraken are similar. Maybe hs60 is a little better. As I said, the Kraken one's sound is a little blurring. But I didn't test the Kraken one's sound very much.- ComfortablenessTo me, Hs60 is the winner. First, the earpad is comfortable in both hs60 and Kraken. But there are 2 things I don't like about the Kraken one. 1) the headset could not stay on my head... when I lowered my head, it'd slip down. 2) the earpad cannot cover my ear very well, not a big issue, but hs60 does cover my ear obviously better.- MicHs60's mic works well and the sound quality is nice. Well... the mic on my Kraken one just couldn't work correctly. The volume was low and I couldn't adjust it. But I do like the retractable mic design in Kranken. Hs60's mic can only be attached or removed.Funny thing: I couldn't get the mic on hs60 work too at first, and just as I was so frustrating I found the problem was that I didn't push hard enough on the mic boom and it wasn't actually attached. After it's attached, the mic worked great.",
          "Delivered in a thin plastic bag, box was damaged like it was supporting a boulder but thankfully the only feature that isn't working is the raise to mute. The sound is good and the mic still works. I'll just have to repackage and wrap it up. I have no doubt that if you receive this with a better looking outer package, this headset will last some abuse with only a convenience feature to fail first. I'll update more later if the headset fully dies before a year.",
          "Just be careful with the headset.  This is the 2nd time I have purchased this particular Headset/Mick combo and I absolutely love the way it fits and the quality of the mic.  Now for the down side, Please be  ultra careful when using the headset  or it will  break.  The over all design is well done However, and this is the big  very bad design  flaw  the clamp that connects the head band to the headset is made of plastic and overtime this clamp  will break (it should have been made of metal or plastic covered metal)  allowing the headband and headset to become detached .  this is  simply a bad design choice.  Other then this  the whole thing is praise worthy",
          "I've been using these for about two months now and I think they're a good pair of headphones.PROS- The quality sound is really good and you can adjust it to your like with the iCUE app (only works when plugged with the USB adapter)- The cord is long enough to use in a CPU but not long enough to bother you when connected to a laptop or PS4 controller.- They're soft and cushioned, also pretty lightweight. The earcuffs fit over the ears.- The full swivel let's you place them flat on a surface.- Flip to mute mic comes very handy for gaming and videocalls.CONS- The mic produces good quality sound, but the volume is super low. Beware that even when you enhance it in the iCUE app it still sounds low. I had to go through my computer settings and adjust the gain, to the point where I can hear some other outside noises when I talk but now my voice is loud and clear.- These headphones are narrow and can be tight for the first few days. My head is small (5'1\" here) and it still felt like it was pressuring my temples. Once I got them a bit stretched out, they sit nicely on my head.Overall they're quite good for the money. Just beware when watching a YT mic test, they have probably enhanced the mic volume a lot in order to sound good. That's the only downside for me. You'll have to take your time to adjust many settings to get it where you want it.",
          "A great pair of headphones thats been reliable for almost two years now, though you will need to change the muffs eventually the stock ones do tend to fall apart, but replacement kits are easy to get and cheap. For the price its hard to beat especially the frame of the band itself  is tough, padded and ive had no fear of breaking it.Sound quality is great but i would imagine not as good as studio level headphones, but you probably got these for gaming than anything. The mic is good and picks you up clearly. The two negatives to this pair is the very short cord is extremely limiting and confines you to your pc space, i cant even reach the other side of my desk with them on! The other issue is the mute button seems to be non functional but you may need to mess with the sound driver they want you to download to get them to work.",
          "We had one just like this before, but the cord got tied up in the chair wheels so grabbed another. These things are great!",
          "This headset really slaps the floor when I lose in a game match. Has a mute button for when you want to use slurs against your opponents\u2019 or teammates on the fly. Comes with memory foam cushions that encompass your ear more than an ASMR playlist at 12 AM. The headphone brackets are made of a lightweight metal, which is great for durability and when you step on the scale for the first time in 6 months. Would recommend and purchase again if need be.",
          "Only the headphones came in the box.",
          "First off, the headphones are great! Sound is crisp and detailed, and for the most part comfortable. However if you have larger ears or ears that stick out more you will likely find it being uncomfortable after a while. The cups are not the deepest and the plastic protecting the speakers bulge out a little bit so it puts pressure on bigger ears. I\u2019ll be ordering a different set of Corsair headphones but will be keeping these as back up or to let a friend borrow and what not. Would definitely recommend if you have smaller or more flat ears!",
          "These headphones have decent sound, good feeling build quality, but after some time they start to feel uncomfortable on the top of my head. My earcups started coming right around the end of the warranty, but corsair support didn't really hesitate to get me a replacement set of earcups.also if you grab them by the metal on the sides, over time the paint will start to come off (see picture)",
          "Pros: Comfort is 8/10, the ear pads are amazing and headband is very well cushioned. Clamps a bit tight but I\u2019m sure will get better with time.Microphone quality is almost on par with a stand alone USB microphone like a blue yeti only a little more compressed .Cons:Sound is a bit veiled to my ears. I\u2019m playing on PS5 with and without included USB sound card and the sound quality sounds okay for FPS games. But it sounds like there is something covering the driver and limiting how the headphone could perform.Obviously sound is very subjective. Other than that, these headphones are a pretty good all in one solution for gaming. With a microphone that you could 1000% use for live-streaming and people would think you\u2019re using an actual mic.",
          "I got these to improve my hearing while gaming, FPS specifically. As an audiophile I have a pretty well tuned ear to good sound quality, and overall these are pretty well balanced and sound quite good considering their primary intent is for gaming use. The mic works well, with minimal to no complaints being heard. The reason for my low rating is these over ear headphones which are supposed to be noise cancelling/minimizing cause a significant amount of noise if I ever move or press on the headphone itself. The left ear is particularly bad. It sounds as though the cone itself is being flexed with compressed air which clicks, as well as the sound of air escaping the enclosed area of the earphone itself as well. I have had a handful of $100+ headphones, including a pair of high end B&W PX wireless headphones, and a studio quality pair of Sony MDR7506's, and I've never experienced this phenomena on any previous pair of over the ear headphones. I'm not sure if this is something unique to my particular pair or if this is more common, but it's unpleasant and makes me enjoy wearing them less because of the added sound the headphones introduce to my ears. Buyer beware.",

The only way to get it to show up is to physically remove/reinsert the dongle.Intermittently, audio playback will stop for a few seconds every so often while watching videos.There is a noticeable delay in resuming audio from a paused state.  Likely due to iCUE's audio processing.Sometimes when resuming there will be no audio.The above issues are not present if bypassing the USB dongle, but then you're paying more for features you are not using.Took a full week to get a basic response from Corsair support concerning the iCUE issues.On PC, these may work great, but on macOS, not so much, think these are going back.",
          "The audio on the headphones are so loud that if you are in a voice chat or party it echos very bad, you literally have to turn it down to the point where the game volume is almost unbearable to be able to not only hear ur friends but cut off the echo. I would definitely recommend if you are a solo player looking for audio quality for your games, but if you play multiplayer I would suggest a different mic unless u have no problem with turning it down everytime.",
          "I go through headphones pretty quick, not because I'm necessarily hard on them, but I use them everyday (mostly for work) and they just don't seem to last.  These have outlasted all the others, mostly IMHO because of superior design.  I mostly use them plugged into the USB port of my PC, and the included attachment to do so is short while the length is provided by the long cord, a much better design that my HyperX headphones, where the cord and amplifier are about equal length...which sounds great, but because I move around a lot, I guess the headphone jack got loose and after a while I could only hear out of one ear unless I jiggled it around, but if I pulled it out slightly to get stereo sound, the microphone no longer worked.This design also has the volume and mute button on the headphone itself, much easier than on the amplifier like others that is not always easy or convenient to reach, especially if you need to mute quickly.  The microphone can also detach when I'm not using it, and it even comes with a little cover for the jack to keep it clean with the microphone is not plugged in.The cord itself is hardwired into the headset, so I can't use the headphone case I had because it won't quite fit with the cord (granted it wasn't designed for this model, but it would fit if the cord was detachable), but this doesn't really bother me as I rarely put them in a case and honestly feel better about hardwired cords as I've just had too many problems with headphones where everything detaches, just more chances for things to go wrong or get damaged.Overall, great headphones, sound is great, others can hear me perfectly clearly, ears don't get tired even after wearing them all day, and the \"top part\" that connects the two sides and fits on your head is extra padded and sturdy, something I haven't seen in even the most expensive headphones.",
          "The overall build of the headset is very solid. I honestly thought that it would be a bit flimsily but trying it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised. The metal and material hold up extremely well. The microphone is also adjustable and fairly flexible. It bends in almost every direction and is very dynamic. The sound quality from it sounds very clear and thorough, great for gaming or just talking in general for Discord or Zoom calls. My only gripe with this amazing headset is that it is definitely geared towards smaller heads. The headset band is very rigid and feels very tight for someone with a bigger head like me. The cushioned earpads cancel the noise almost to perfection but they're really tight in my opinion. They clamp down really hard and it feels cramped for my ears.Of course all of these issues might be completely non existent for someone with a smaller head but for a bigger person like me, it causes a lot of pain after just like 30 minutes of usage. It crunches down on my head and it pains me head after a while. Just a little note for the bigger folks in search of a head set.",
          "If you are looking for a good PC gaming headset then this is what you want. The USB adapter is everything for me. It adds so much more accessibility. The headset is solid and does not feel cheap. Sound and voice are good.",
          "TL;DR: Lasted me about a year of casual use, decent surround sound and noise cancelling, great sound quality, gets uncomfortable after a few hours of use (picture above is them finally giving up and breaking after a year)I bought this headset nearly a year ago and during that time it's done me pretty well, especially for only being about 40 bucks whenever I bought it. Don't expect to use it very long term, given the headset only undergoes very basic use and only lasted about a year. During that time there's also been a noticable degrade in mic quality. The sound stayed pristine for music and TV shows. For videogames, probably not. The surround sound could definitely be better, and it has trouble articulating where people actually are.The earpads are generally comfortable, just don't expect to be wearing the headphones for long periods. They are pretty tight on your head and in my experience it gets pretty uncomfortable after only a few hours of use. Whenever I have them on, they have good noise cancelling. I'm not sure if that's even a good advertizing point, since I bought them primarily for the (false) open-back. I can't hear anything other than the game whenever I have them on. Not that great when you have people calling for you, but if you're into that then these are a good option.",
          "Muy buen sonido y personalizaci\u00f3n. Juego csgo con ellas",
          "Wow just wow. This is probably one of the best headsets I've had the pleasure of using. It came with mostly plastic free packing.The sound quality is  amazingly crazy good and the cord has a small silicone belt to keep the excess cord bundled gently.What are you waiting for buy this headset now.",
          "I'm not picky, but most headphones hurt my ears. These ones sit comfortably around my ears. Sound quality seems better than my other audio devices. The headphones do muffle outside noise at least a little. Sometimes when I am gaming I need to reposition the mic for my friends to hear me better, but this sensitivity seems worth it. Loud noises that are away from the mic do not seem to get picked up as easily.",
          "\u00a0As a gamer, I have used the Corsair HS60 PRO for 1 year and 6 months, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The 7.1 virtual surround sound is amazing, allowing me to immerse myself in games and hear every detail. The USB DAC provides clear audio and eliminates any background noise. The headset is comfortable to wear for long periods and the microphone quality is great for communicating with other players. I have used this headset on multiple platforms including PC, Xbox one without any issues. Overall, I highly recommend the Corsair HS60 PRO to any gamer looking for a high-quality gaming headset.",
          "First of all the microphone is very good. Sound quality very good as well. Even plugged into a controller. BUT if you so much as touch the cable near the controller it has a seizure. Also these headphones are extremely tight they are comfortable around my ears but uncomfortable on my temple.",
          "Terrible echo",
          "Very good gaming headset",
          "The first one I had was broken after the second day. The replacement one is working so far. it is great when it is great",
          "Sonido espectacular..para trabajo en casa o para oir musica en alta definici\u00f3n",
          "The sound quality and fit is nice.  I have a big head, and it fits well.  As far as I know, it doesn't have noise canceling, but I wasn't expecting it to (advertised correctly)."

          "I do like these headphones and generally enjoy Corsair's products. When I was in the market for a new set, I landed on these and overall - they're good. I can't say they're the \"best\" headset as everyone is looking something different. Whether it's noise cancelation or sound quality, I'd say these serve my needs personally.That being said, I don't like the ear cups. The material itself is fine. I like leather cups, but the problem is the size. I have small ears but even that didn't help the fact that my ears are pressed up against the inner walls of the headset. They do at least give you the option to remove the cups and replace them with a better pair (which is what I plan to do) but I do think the cups could be just a little bigger - or at least have a second pair that are bigger in comparison.Overall, pretty satisfied with these.",
          "I like this headset, coming from a Logitech G935 it feels like a bit of an upgrade but a different flavor of headset, as my G935 had macro buttons and a flip up/down mic.Pros:Good sound for gaming (I have other headphones for when I want really good sound quality, and if you're trying to get audiophile levels of sound quality, digitally, lol)Free Dolby Atmos licenseBluetoothPremium constructionCorsair software is alright (I count this as a pro since most gaming headsets require software anyways)Cons:Previously my G935 didn't have 2.4ghz interference, I sit right under my router and this headset kept cutting in and out. It only stopped after I turned off that channel.No dedicated on/off buttonThe mic does not retract or flip up/down",

          "Los headsets tienen buen dise\u00f1o y calidad del sonido. La cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido se puede compensar usando el software y con los tonos de bajo. Y su usas Dolby, se pone aun mejor el sonido.Los contras: cada vez que los uso, no hay un momento que el headset me hace un sonido de *clang* como si se estuviera pegando algo en las bisagras a pesar que no les hago presi\u00f3n. De vez en cuando el headset se desconecta del dongle a la par de el y hay que esperar que vuelva a conectarse. El precio es algo excesivo para la realidad del producto, asi que si lo consigues en rebaja u oferta, puedes pensar en adquirir uno. De lo contrario, ni lo hagas.",
          "It is awsome!! but the battery time is shorter then what I think...",
          "This is the first headset I've used that has everything I need:- High quality audio (studio quality)- Clean and clear mic (I get comments on how crisp my voice sounds with this mic)- Comfortable (stays on softly and firmly, which I need while moving in VR or just walking around)- Aesthetically pleasing (I just like the simplicity of the shape and color, it's just really nice to look at)I've tried several different high-end headsets (SteelSeries Arctis, HyperX Cloud Revolver, Astro A50, Logitec Pro X) , and this one beats them all, as the others have some shortcoming in one of the above areas. The Virtuoso XT is the perfect version of the previous Virtuoso (which I've used for nearly a year) by adding more padding, making the mic less stiff, and lowering the intensity of the RGB.It works perfectly. I'm very happy with the redesign, and companies that deliver what people want should be supported with reviews.",
          "Good headset all around, but I'll have to return it as the audio quality isn't up to my standards.  If you like your music but don't mind low actuation in the bass and mid areas, you might like it. High range sounded very nice and crisp, which makes for a better FPS experience.Ear pads are trash which makes the headset uncomfortable as well, you'll likely want to replace the pads with something nicer.",
          "The depth of sound is fantastic, the highs and lows are great, i saw a lot of feedback about the ear cups being \u201ctoo small\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m a big 6\u20194\u201d dude with sizable ears (not dumbo but big man ears lol) and these ear cups fit PERFECTLY. I did order some cooling gel replacement ear cups but totally unnecessary. Literally plug and play\u2014 have now used on PS5, gaming pc, work pc and will Bluetooth my phone tomorrow\u2026 all seamless plug and play. Couldn\u2019t be happier.",
          "I was on a search to replace my old Turtle Beach X12s that had finally died on me and was amazed to find that almost none of the available headset options had a sidetone/mic monitoring feature. These Virtuosos were the rare ones that do, albeit enabled through the desktop app, so I decided to pick them up despite the steep price. I am on PC and don't know how well they work with consoles.Pros- SIDETONE/MIC MONITORING. I like being able to hear my own voice so I can hear how loud I am talking so I don't annoy other people I am living with. This feature was a must and was extremely hard to find. It was also really easy to set up, despite what some other reviewers have said.- WIRELESS. It's nice not getting tangled up in wires all the time and I didn't notice any latency. Set up was painless as all you have to do is plug in the provided USB wireless dongle thing.- CONTROLS. The controls on the headset were pretty good and easy to use.- BUILD QUALITY. These things are sturdy and very solidly built, however that leads into my first con...Cons- HEAVY. These were so heavy that my hair hurt after wearing them for 30 minutes. If I turned my head at all while wearing these, they would shift out of place probably due to how heavy they are, and thus I was constantly adjusting.- FIT. Building off of their heaviness, these also just did not fit right at all for me. The perfect circle ear cups are well... not ear shaped and didn't fit my ear-shaped ears. I found that due to the shape of the cups, my ears were constantly touching the pads and I couldn't get a good seal to block out sound behind me. I also felt like the pads on them were not deep enough, so my ears were hitting the insides.- BREATHABILITY. Not great. My ears would be very hot after only an hour of gaming, something that doesn't happen to me with other headphones I have.- BATTERY LIFE. I don't know what the standard battery life is for competitor productss, but compared to my wireless Sony headphones, the battery life on these was terrible. On top of that, there didn't seem to be an obvious way to check what the battery level was at and I ended up having to play games with them plugged in a few times, which was awkward because I didn't have any cables long enough to reach my normal sitting position.ConclusionUltimately I decided these were not worth the steep price of $270 and decided to return them. For that amount of money, I can get a separate pair of really good headphones and a studio quality microphone, which is what I have decided to do. I initially was going to give 3 stars, but considering the price tag I bumped it down to 2.",
          "It's a very good headset that can play audio from your Bluetooth devices and pc simultaneously. Almost everything about it I love...  except the headband. They said to have added more padding but it still isn't much. Thank goodness I have a small head or I would have returned it by now. Even though I had a small head the first couple of days it was actually quite painful to wear. Eventually it breaks in and there is a sweet spot for small headed people like me. I broke them in and haven't had a problem since. They are my daily headphones now. I would definitely reconsider though if you've always thought yourself to have a larger head size because you will feel that headband. The premium build and cool features are just not worth the pain.It's also nice to by some third party ear pads for it. You can even find some nice fuzzy ones that keep your ears warm in the winter. Cool! I like being able to customize!",
          "Got these headphones as a christmas present for my teenager who likes to game while talking on the phone with their friends. I've tried them out a few times as well for various things like playing games, watching TV, etc. After a couple months of use we've got mostly positive things to say. My kid loves the ability to hook up to both the PS5 and their iPhone at the same time. They've told me the sound is great both through the headphones and through the mic, and they are very comfortable even for long periods of time. I find the sound to be really good and although they are comfortable for me as well the only negative is they are pretty heavy.",
          "Es un excelente producto. Las terminaciones son muy buenas. Se nota que es premium y tiene calidad en la construcci\u00f3n.Compatibilidad con todo, menos con Xbox (aqu\u00ed unicamente se puede usar de forma cableada al joystick). Lo podes conectar al celular por USB-C o bluetooth. Lo uso en la mac, en la PC con windows y en la play de forma inal\u00e1mbrica o cableada.El micr\u00f3fono, es el mejor micr\u00f3fono inal\u00e1mbrico que vi hasta el momento. No parece que fuera inal\u00e1mbrico, es demasiado bueno, me vi muchas reviews donde streamers y youtubers lo usan para sus videos, en vez de un micr\u00f3fono dedicado.La \u00fanica contra que tiene es la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda, cuando las luces RGB que est\u00e1n a los costados est\u00e1n activadas.  Y eso es pr\u00e1cticamente siempre, porque no tiene memoria interna, entonces la \u00fanica forma de desactivar las luces es utilizando el software propietario ICUE (que no funciona bien todav\u00eda en las macs con chip apple m1). Es  decir solamente podemos tener una duraci\u00f3n \u00f3ptima de la bater\u00eda cuando lo usamos con luces apagadas, y eso solo pasa en windows.Si no fuera por la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda, debe ser el auricular inal\u00e1mbrico m\u00e1s perfecto que hay, para video llamadas en el trabajo, juegos en red, juegos offline, playstation (xbox, solo con cable), y con un microfono que con una precisi\u00f3n asombrosa. Repito el microfono debe ser el punto m\u00e1s alto del headset.Recomandable 100% si no te molesta cargarlo cada 2 dias usandolo en PS4/5 o en mac (al menos hasta el momento) En PC apagandole las luces, dura muchisimo m\u00e1s.",
          "For anyone upgrading from something older like a wireless Void Pro, the range on these is actually worse. Maybe if you live in a studio apartment with no walls, or a field perhaps, you\u2019re not going to get 60ft of range out of these. Maybe 25 ft if you\u2019re lucky. I was looking forward to being able to let my dog out back while staying on audio, but no chance with these.However, being able to use the wireless and Bluetooth to hear audio from two sources at once is a big deal, especially if you work remotely. If you want to listen/watch something on a phone while not being tracked by your employer (or just saving some resources on your work device), this is a killer add-on I never knew I was missing until I had it.Bass is disappointing.",
          "I will be the first to say that I am not an audiophile, but I expected better for the price.  I am a huge Corsair fan and I have a set of HS60 Pro Surround headphones and I don't think the quality is any better no matter if they are plugged or using the wireless receiver.  They definitely are not louder as that I can hear about anything going on in my house when I'm in my office and they are turned all the way up.",
          "I was a little skeptical about this product based on some of the reviews.  I was using the Arctics Pro Wireless which I enjoyed.  Thought the Arctis pro seemed a bit closed in and not so expansive.And I haven't used the mic yet so I don't know about the noise cancelling.After listening to the Corsair.... Wow, so much better spaciousness and sound.  It is definitely much much more comfortable to wear also.  I also do like the fact that there is a switch to turn off the wireless to preserve the battery instead of an timer.  Dolby Atmos is a game changer.Overall I gave it a 4 out of 5 review because it's battery life is not as long as I'm used to but all in all a great product.",
          "What am I looking for in a headset? I want a headset play wireless and bluetooth at the same time. I want a headset that doesn't scream gamer as I plan on showing my face in conference calls. I want a headset with a good microphone so that I don't have to repeat myself. I want a reliable headset. This headset seemed to have checked all the boxes. Except Corsair manages to screw up everything they get right about this headset. I love the microphone. It's great. Sounds super clear. Why is there a bright LED at the end of the end of the microphone that is always in my periphery? It's super annoying. You can turn it off in the iCue software! One might say. And you'd be right. But that setting doesn't get saved to your headset so if you use it on a different device or if you decide to use it via bluetooth only the light turns back on!The headset seems to be really well built and is heavy. That's usually a good thing. The problem is that the clamping force on this headset is really light. Most other headsets will spread the weight of the headset against your ears and the top of your head. The top of your head bears the whole weight of the headset which makes it very uncomfortable to wear for a long time. At least for me.Well why don't you just upgrade the earpads to make it more comfortable? First of all I shouldn't have to do that after spending over $200 on a headset. Second of all I did and now I know why Corsair opted to use the thinner pads. I bought a pair of the thicker pads and I look absolutely ridiculous with the headset on. Like some kind of robot princess Leia. One of the selling points of this headset for me is that it doesn't look \"gamer\". The super wide head doesn't exactly look professional either.I'm not an audiophile but the sound is bad. Voices seem distorted and higher pitches hurt my ears.I want to like this headset I really do, but there are so many negatives that I have to pass.",
          "I was really upset with the way these sounded straight out of the box, but after messing with the EQ settings in iCue I was able to get a nice sound out of them. If you don't feel like messing with them yourself, The Techne has a video on YouTube called \"The Best EQ Settings For Your Gaming Headset\" and the preset he shows in that video sounds miles better than the default profile. I haven't had any comfort issues so far and my only complaint with these headphones is that it would be nice if the EQ profile could be stored on the device to be used on other systems like the PS5.",
          "When you receive the package you feel premium quality immediately. All materials are fancy, with great quality, comfortable and robust at the same time. Battery lasts around 10 - 12 hours in my case. Wireless connection might depend on the amount of interference you have in your house (walls, doors, closed spaces, etc.) is normally around 8 meters in closed spaces. Sound quality is outstanding, you enjoy the videos or music in a more immersive way. You just feel it different.For some people it might be a little bit heavy in your head or if you have big ears you may need to buy additional earpads for more comfort.",
          "I really like these wireless headphones, I use them A LOT, maybe 6-8 hours a day. The sound is amazing, the ability to detach the mic is useful. My only complain, since I have glasses, is after a while it can dig my frames into my head and my head starts to hurt where my frames are. Beyond that however, I really like these headphones. Zero problems so far technically.",
          "The Virtuoso XT is by no means a cheap option, but the quality of the build itself immediately lets you know you\u2019ve got a quality product.I use this on my PC for high quality gaming with Dolby Atmos and the sound quality is incredible. The surround is mind blowing, and the ease of use is really good. I can have it simultaneously connected to my phone via Bluetooth and can chat on the phone while also playing games and hear both really well. It\u2019s a very versatile unit. If you\u2019re going to be using it with a laptop, the Bluetooth connection does do Dolby Atmos surround also so you can enjoy that without using the USB connection.Battery life is really really impressive as I can get a full day of gaming out of one charge. I\u2019m not sure how many hours the battery lasts, but it\u2019s really a lot.Couldn\u2019t be happier with this headset.",
          "I wanted a set of decent gaming headphones w/mic that would work over Bluetooth so I didn\u2019t need to plug anything into a usb port on my laptop.  These have been working perfectly.",
          "This is not my first Corsair headset, I had several cheaper models before and they work fine.  I bought this headset to upgrade from my current Corsair headset.  The bluetooth, USB wireless dongle, USB wired, and 3.5mm wired connections are excellent options to make this a versatile headset.  But this ended up as an expensive disappointment.When I got this headset, I was very impressed with the premium built to it.  It came with a very nice packaging.  Inside the box is the headset, the detachable microphone, USB dongle, USB C cable, 3.5mm cable, carrying pouch, and user guide.  I will primarily use this headset for PC gaming, so I used the USB dongle for wireless connection.  The setup was quick and easy.  I made sure to have the firmware updated both for headset and USB dongle.  It should be good, right?  wrong, immediately I noticed that the audio keeps cutting off.  I tried different games, and even watched movies, and same thing, the audio cuts off intermittently.  I tested it on a different computer, and same issue.  I tested the bluetooth connection,  USB wired, and 3.5mm wired, and they all worked fine, so I know it is only the USB dongle connection that has an issue.  I tried looking online everywhere and seen a lot of other users having the same issue.  I tried the suggested solutions thinking it is caused by interference.  I tried to stay as far away from my wireless router, I even changed the channels in my wireless router, but no go.  I even tried bringing my laptop outside the house in a spot where there is no wireless signal or any other wireless device, but still have the audio cut off frequently.  I also adjusted the  audio format to the lowest setting (44.1kHz), and turned off Dolby Atmos,  still didn't resolve the issue.  I finally gave up and just waited for Corsair to provide a firmware update.  I couple of updates later, and I still have the same issue.  I think I have given Corsair enough time for firmware updates, and I'm really disappointed.  The audio cut off is so annoying as it happens like every couple of seconds.  I can't enjoy a game or movie with the USB wireless connection.  In fairness, the bluetooth connection works fine and I absolutely love it with bluetooth.  But for gaming, I prefer to use the USB wireless, and the experience just makes me regret purchasing this headset.Maybe it's just a bad USB dongle?  I don't know, but I do know that there are several other users out there having the same issue.  I gave Corsair enough time to provide firmware updates, but that didn't resolve the issue.  I love everything about this headset if not for the audio cutting off.  So, beware if you are looking into buying this headset.",
          "I've had these for about a month now and they're just alright. I had to buy the after market ear cups for them because the ones that came with it were so horrible and uncomfortable. I bought them on sale, so with the earpads added it was something like $270 total. My head is small, so I bought it despite the reviews that warned me about this.I wanted a headset I could connect to both my home and work PC at the same time and these allowed for that due to the bluetooth. They're sturdy, good quality build, and the battery life is great. The quality of the sounds is alright, nothing special, the mic sounds meh, and comfort is non-existent without the buying the earpads. Also, many headsets these days have the head band at the top rather than the padding they use on this. Even their much cheaper HS80s have that design. It is kind of crazy they didn't use it as it is just objectively more comfortable and these are so dang expensive.In the end, my biggest issue is Corsair putting these at a price point north of $250 and people having to buy aftermarket earpads for them to keep them on for more than 30 min without getting a headache. In the end, I don't think I'd recommend these to anyone given the price. If I hadn't got them on Black Friday I probably would have sent them back.",
          "The build quality is great! Although sound is not to my liking. At max volume it does not get loud enough for me. The Corsair ICUE equalizer is great to adjust sound to your preference but there is no way to increase it's max volume. So I am returning these and sticking to my Void Pros as they are louder and cheaper.",
          "FOR HEAD-PAIN or EAR-PAIN:A sennheiser HD280 headband can be added to fix head pain. It is a tight fit, but it is extremely comfortable.Also some cloth cooling pad ear cups will help with heat and not deteriorate like stock Corsair cups.Both are on Amazon.This headset can accept audio from: wired USB C, Wireless USB dongle, Wireless Bluetooth, and wired Aux(3.5mm/line in).This headset can simultaneously (at the same time) combine audio sources from Line In (aux/3.5mm), Bluetooth, and EITHER USB line in or USB wireless dongle. (Meaning you can use 3 of the 4 audio inputs at the same time, where you can only choose one of two USB options)You control the USB volume using the volume wheel on the right cup (choose either wireless or wired USB using a switch near the volume wheel), the Bluetooth volume using the volume buttons on the right cup (hold the middle button to enter Bluetooth mode), and the AUX volume using the volume wheel on the provided aux cable.You can only output audio (via the mic input) to one device at a time it seems. It seems to prioritize Bluetooth mic input over USB mic input. But I haven\u2019t done a ton of testing.Great for PC discord over Bluetooth, PS5 gaming over USB Dongle.The PS5 connection via AUX was echoing a lot when mic input was on, but worked perfectly using the USB Wireless Dongle.",

They have a good amount of bass that can be increased, the sound imaging does very well, the Bluetooth and wireless dongle features work great for my ps5/phone.

Somewhere in the labyrinth of articles that corsair calls their help system, I read that for some reason, it should be charged from a standard USB port instead of a charger, but that didn't charge it fast enough either. Ten-ish hours of charging should be enough to fully charge it, but it's not. The sidetone \"feature\" cannot be turned off, so screw you if you like wearing headphones so that you don't hear things in the room you're in. The sound will also occasionally \"hiccup\" for no discernible reason. As a result of all this, I have come to a few conclusions:1. Corsair is grossly incompetent at anything software related, including firmware.2. They are fully aware of this, and will not do anything to fix it.3. I will not be returning these headphones.4. Corsair either ignores the \"X of Y found this page helpful\" ratings on their help pages or doesn't care that many of these pages are less than 25% \"helpful.\" Some pages have a helpfulness rating in the single digits. These ratings are completely deserved.5. Corsair's hardware is still good, but they're slipping.6. Bitter though I am, I still like these headphones. The sound quality is good and they're fairly comfortable, even for a person with a bigger head like myself.Original review as follows:I'm returning these. They're comfortable, and the sound quality is good, but I had to charge the battery twice in a single day, and it didn't finish charging after a full night. It's unusably short.The standard suggestion is to disable the LEDs on the sides, which isn't an option, because iCUE 4 will not run on my computer. I have tried everything on the forums, everything on reddit, and everything I could think of, but iCUE 4 always crashes when it starts up (As far as I can tell, the problem has to do with one of Windows' DLLs, so I can have either iCUE 4 or Windows, but not both). The lesson I've learned from buying Corsair is that the hardware is good, but the software is abject trash.A real shame that these are unusable, because they are pretty nice besides that.",
          "Positives:\u2022Comfortable for long periods of time. I\u2019ve got a bigger head\\ears than most and it\u2019s not an issue.\u2022Looks great and has great build quality as far a material goes. Packaging is great and comes with a travel bag.\u2022Audio is good.\u2022Bluetooth connection while also having game audio is the highlight.Negatives:\u2022Wireless connection is too sensitive. If anything gets in between headset and wireless receiver you\u2019ll get constant interruptions.\u2022Wireless range is weak especially if you let\u2019s say step out of your room.\u2022Wired set up sounds better but for some reason causes friends to hear their own echo.\u2022Has a default power save setting where if the headset doesn\u2019t sense it\u2019s in use it it turns off Bluetooth after (I believe) 30 minutes. Can be changed on computer.All in all it\u2019s a good headset with great features I just wish that for the price they polished out the imperfections.",
          "If you searched for \"Xbox Wireless Headset\" and got this product as a result, keep searching.  Yes, you can use them with Xbox -- but only by plugging into the controller and losing most of the advertised features.  (There is one small photo in the product description explaining this but the title in the store is very misleading.)That being said, they *are* quality headphones.  The build materials are sturdy and nicely machined, the sound is good (from PC), and I expect them to last longer than the many plastic headsets I have had to retire simply because they worked but could no longer be worn.I give three stars because of the misleading title and because, if you have a large head like I do, they are not especially comfortable.Bottom line:  I would return these if I had not already returned the *other* pair (from another manufacturer) that also failed to disclose the lack of compatibility with Xbox.  If you have a small to average size noggin and only play on PC, buy these.",
          "After sifting through a myriad of reviews, I picked out the Corsair Virtuoso XT version because of various reviews ha pointed out that this headset was one of the most well-favored headsets around.In terms of comfort, my head is actually pretty large. This usually means that headsets can actually run pretty tight on my head. I also have ear piercings around my cartilage, and many headsets tend to press against this piercing, making it a bit agonizing to wear headsets at times--but not this one. With my large head, the Virtuoso headset stays snugly onto me. I feel no major pressure on my head after wearing it for nearly two hours straight, and frankly the sound quality is good. I personally listen to a lot of house music and pay very close attention to bass--to be honest, the bass on this headset is above average. I tend to use the song \"Infinite\" by Notaker to test bass, and it does a better than average job. The bass in this headset will not rattle your skull, but you will certainly hear it. By purchasing this product, you also get Dolby Atmos, which is basically a neat feature that gives movies, certain games, and videos a very crisp, theatre-style sound--which is really quite awesome.The microphone quality is also actually very good for a microphone on a headset. The slipstream feature allows your voice to come out clearly, and not muffled or drowned out (looking at you, Razer). The finish and feel of this headset is nice, and will not be a hamper to you if you also wear glasses or tend to put headphones around your neck.I'd rate this headset at a 8.5/10--because if I wanted 9 or 10/10, I'd basically start getting a professional microphone stand and a Sony WH1000XM4/Apple Airpods Max.This is as good as it's gonna get.",
          "I bought these to work from home, I also paired them with the Virtuoso XT Ear Pads because after watching review videos on YouTube, everyone complained about the ear pads being too thin.  This combination is perfect, the thicker ear pads stay cool and keep the noise out.  The mic only picks up your voice, not background noise, I have tested that with a crying and screaming three-year-old, and a barking dog in the background and my clients have never mentioned anything about noise.  The only thing I don't like is that there is no power button, you have to hold down the Mic button to shut them off, but when you plug them into charge they power back on.  Corsair should implement the power button, these I love the fact that you can swap mic's.  These are also high fidelity and the music audio quality is fantastic, you can use these as a headset for work, zoom, gaming and for just music they also come with a blue tooth dongle to use on any gaming console or pc etc. etc. definitely worth the sticker price.",
          "I needed a headset that would connect to 2 devices at the same time.  My work computer and my phone.  It does that! It came with a USB dongle that I plug into the computer (plug and play! No extra software needed!) And I Bluetooth connect to my phone. So I can be wireless for both devices at the same time!",
          "I've been on the search for a solid wireless gaming headset, and after a ton of research, I decided to give the Corsair Virtuoso XT a shot. I ordered them along with the Corsair HS80s, and the Razer Blackshark V2, and sadly the Virtuoso XT's were the worst of the bunch.As a disclaimer, my product may have been used even though I bought them as new. The unboxing experience left me thinking that the headset had been tampered with, and none of the components were wrapped the way they were in the HS80s box. This is just a guess, but something felt off when I opened the box.The Positives:I liked that the earpads were replaceable. I was able to grab some aftermarket earpads from Wicked Cushions, and they were easy to install.The Bluetooth and wireless dongle simultaneous connection is the best feature about this headset. This was the main reason why I wanted to try these so badly. I love the thought of being able to play my game and not worry about missing a phonecall or important notification. The headset's separate controls located on the headset itself was also perfectly convenient. This feature worked great!The range was good enough for my small house. When I walked from one side of my small house to the other, I had 2 small hiccups at the furthest point, which isn't perfect, but it was good enough. This, however, was the worst of the 3 I tested as the HS80 and BlackShark V2 had no hiccups in the same distance.The Negatives:Comfort is seriously lacking for a headset this expensive. The headband might've actually been worse than the earpads. The way it pushed into my head was really uncomfortable, and even after about 30 minutes with them on, I had to take them off. I also have a big head, so that could be part of the reason for discomfort. The earpads were too shallow and didn't provide the comfort I wanted in a premium flagship product. This was something that I read in other reviews, so I purchased some Wicked Cushions replacements, and they were the perfect amount of padding needed on this headset. I much preferred the aftermarket pads to the stock, which again shouldn't be an issue at this price point.The sound quality was not good enough. It felt like they were wrapped in plastic wrap before being placed on my ears. Everything was so muffled and not clean. Adjusting the EQ made things better, but still not good enough for me to actually enjoy my game sound and music.Sidetone was way too low, but this seemed to be a theme with the wireless headsets I purchased. It was roughly the same as the HS80s, with the BlackShark V2 having by far the worst Sidetone of the 3. All 3 were definitely not loud enough to be effective.The mic quality wasnt what I had hoped and expected. They boasted a broadcast quality mic, so I was especially excited to get in and try it out, but some friends pointed out that the HS80s mic was much better than the Virtuoso XTs. It was still good enough for daily use, but I guess I just expected better quality with how much it was built up in the description. In comparison to my wired $80 Logitech G Pro headset, the Logitech was streets ahead, but that's also a possible unfair wired v. wireless comparison.The final negative, and by far the biggest red flag, was the connection consistently dropping out in weird ways. Multiple times, my sound would cut out in my discord party, but my mic would still be working. So they'd hear everything I said, but I wouldn't hear a word of what they said. I had to exit the party and come back in to fix it, and this would happen 4 more times in the 2 hours I had this headset on. A major deal breaker. Then sometimes as it be fidgeting with the party to fix this, I'd go back into my game and notice I had no sound in my game. I fixed this by minimizing my game and bringing it back up. So the problems would almost alternate back and forth as I fixed them, which was incredibly frustrating. That just can't happen with a $240 headset.Overall, I can't recommend this gaming headset at all. I think there are far too many problems to make the purchase feel worth it. When you spend $240+ on a headset, you want something that's great quality and that will work without issues. The underwhelming mic, bad sound quality, too low sidetone, and basic connection issues make the Virtuoso XTs a headset to avoid. Ive been told that no \"good\" wireless headsets exist yet, and the 3 I tested have so far only confirmed that theory. It really is a shame because I think Corsair did a great job with the simultaneous Bluetooth/Dongle connections, but that's not enough for me to overlook everything else.",
          "I upgraded to these from the Void Pro and Void elite. One on my personal PC and the other on my work PC. I chose these in particular, probably like many others because the wide range of connection options. Everything from 3.5mm to USB to Bluetooth to corsair's own slipstream frequency works. On the topic of the new slipstream adapter, I immediately noticed I get less range with these than I did with the void. In a 800 sqft apartment I used to be able to go anywhere in my home with the void on and still hear the PC aside from my kitchen, and I'm fairly certain that it  only used to cut out there because the oven is in the way. But now I barley get enough range to get to the closest edeg of the two neighboring rooms, the bathroom and the bedroom.Rather frustrating that a newer and advertised as better wireless technology ends up with less range.",
          "I appreciate so much on this headset, but it just wasn't for me and I had to return it. This headset almost does it all with premium build quality, accessories, exceptional microphone quality(streamer level), compatibility with literally everything out there(phones, consoles and PCs), rgb lights, comfort BUT...the sound quality is a let down in my opinion. For the higher price of this headset plus the advertisement of hi-res and audiophile like quality I think the bass should have been much better. I acknowledge that Corsair probably wanted to move away from exaggerated bass or the muddy type seen on cheap or average gaming headsets which is is a good call but Corsair should have went with a flat frequency response but instead the headset goes beyond flat tuning and actually under emphasizes the bass frequencies(your bass frequencies will play lower than they should). The headset is very very clean sounding sure but bass does not feel punchy at all. The corsair software does come with a capable looking adjustable EQ among many other settings and the Pure direct preset helps a little but my main gripe is that increasing the bass using the EQ or using the bass preset does not help enough because the audio would distort with better tuned bass. Its like the high end drivers don't seem capable of reproducing low end frequencies like popular or good rated gaming headsets. Either that or I got a bad headset, everything else I tried worked well so I'm inclined to believe it was corsairs choice to either hard limit the speaker drivers or the drivers chosen might be just incapable of reproducing low frequencies well.I'd love to buy this exact headset with better drivers that can play punchy bass. I'd happily pay full price or more for that headset.",
          "At first I was a little worried about the sound quality bc I've heard that they are not the best of the best as far as sounds quality goes compared to my Astro A50 that I've been using. That being said they are very versatile with being able to hold the connection wirelessly and with my phone via Bluetooth. They are so much more comfortable and I'm very glad I made the switch to these headphones after experiencing so many issues with my prior headphones that I just gave up on them.",
          "The best headphones I had.",
          "Works great and I'm really liking it. The only issue I have is that the battery goes dead when the computer is on even if its not in use and even if you've selected another sound option like computer speakers.",
          "The headset is amazing and very very good compared to my last headset from corsair, the sound quality, the noise isolation and even the base in the music is extremely good there is one thing though the ear-cups are too small for my ears, my ears scratch against the drivers in the headphones I expected this to happen so I ordered a pair of a 3rd party manufacturers ear cups and now the problem is solved.Overall the headsets are incredible for gaming, music and everyday use I highly recommend this product.",
          "I bought them 8 months ago and this is the best headset I think I ever had. I used to be a Steele Series headset guy... No more.  Search for the velour replacement ear pads. They are worth the $20. I think they make the headset more comfortable, you can wear them for 6-8 hours of gaming with no ear pain at all, and they don't stick to your head if you sweat. The removable microphone is a nice touch, but be sure to remember where you put it if you take it off. Great sound solution for gaming and general music listening. I would buy this again.",
          "Mic not integrated so maybe that makes the Quality of Mic feedback Is Good maybe.If for gaming purpose only its surely its very Good, its not heavy and sound Quality Is Good.For Multi use Like Travel its going To be very bulky as compared To bose ofcourse which Is more anywhere on the Go.I highly reco This version and item.",
          "These are great headphones. The dolby atmos feature on windows 11 works great, makes spatial sound clear to pinpoint footsteps. Mic quality is broadcast grade so its clear and not muffled or tinny. One thing is I switched out the stock earcups for these wicked cushions because they are more soft and come with gel inside of the cups. Pleather makes my ears spicy and with these new earcups I can have the headset on for hours without the heat accumulating in my ears or discomfort. They can also connect with the 2.4 Ghz dongle WHILE using the bluetooth on your phone simultaneously for calls or listening to music AND at the same time can be plugged into my nintendo switch with a 3.5mm jack so I can \"for whatever reason\" have 3 audio inputs going to my headset all at once!! I did notice a slight delay when using the bluetooth function.",
          "I use these for work and gaming and they do the job well for both tasks. Great sound, easy to set up.Use the iCue software to turn the side lights off and get a large battery life boost.",
          "I would give the headphones 5 stars if it wasn't for two things.1. It was too small for my head. I am 5'11 I am on the chunky side, so I know i have a big head. But never have had an issue with headphones/headsets until now. They stretch just shy of being a perfect fit, Even after I got a haircut they fit small.2. While the noise cancelation are better than my previous corsair headset, the audio seems to be lesser than my corsair void pro rgb wireless yellow jackets. I'm actually a little disappointed, as I was hoping for an upgrade, but its only and upgrade with some sacrifices. Expensive buyer remorse, but we'll see how long they last. Hopefully not too long so i can have an excuse to buy something else soon.",
          "Para juegos maravilloso",
          "I really wanted to move these headphones as I am a huge Corsair fan.  Sadly, I had to return these.First the pros: Sound quality is fantastic and they are super high quality build materials, way nicer than others from SteelSeries or even Sennheiser.Cons: primary issue was comfort.  These are super heavy and gave me a headache every time I wire them more than a couple of hours.  The ear cups are not due big eared people so they didn\u2019t go around my entire ear.  The top put pressure on the top of my head and in general pinched my head giving me headaches.  Also the mic not retracting was a pain if you wanted to eat while gaming.  Also people said the mic wasn\u2019t very strong.Sadly I returned them and got a SteelSeries instead and they fit like a glove.  Nowhere tbe build quality or the sound but comfortable.",
          "I purchased these in December of 2021 and I have been using them almost every day since.Pros:- Incredible sound quality. While this is a mainly wireless pair, if you plug into your computer with the included USB cable the frequency range is much wider and I have found this incredibly helpful in games like Escape from Tarkov where sound is important- Great sounding microphone with feedback. Bonus points for the mic being detachable and having an LED to let you know when you are muted- Built in bluetooth so you can connect to a tablet or phone and listen to music or watch a show while you game- Decent software to customize your EQ settings- mostly metal construction with very soft leather padding on the ear cups and headbandCons:- on the heavy side (ok by me since it is a wireless pair but it might bother some people)- 2.4ghz connection is fast with almost no latency but it is the weakest I have used and doesn't travel well when I am walking around my small house- battery life isn't great, even with RGB off- the OEM ear cups are much too shallow and your ears will be uncomfortably close to the drives, I highly recommend getting thicker ear cups"

          "I bought this headset and I have to say the sound quality is phenomenal, the headset is extremely comfortable, and the build quality is pretty good. That's about where it ends. I wanted to love this headset, but the headset would just randomly cut out and eventually lose all sound and would never come back until I turned the headset off and back on, also the battery life left something to be desired. I returned and exchanged for the same headset just in case the first headset was defective, and it worked fine for a few days, but then it started having the same issues with random cut outs and then no sound at all. Headset showed it was connected, but no sound. Had to turn the headset off the and back on to get the sound to come back, and battery life also wasn't any better than the first headset. So I just returned it and said to heck with it. I don't know if it's an issue with the Xbox Series X and their Bluetooth setup, but I have other Bluetooth headsets with minimal issues. As much as I wanted to love the headset, I simply can't recommend it.",
          "Overall these headphones are decent. They are mostly comfortable and work for long periods of time. My major complaint is they do not fit as snuggly against my ears as I would like. I am of average build so it wouldn\u2019t be asking too much for them to be a little tighter on my ears to help block out more noise. The sound is nice and the connection is really good. I can walk across my apartment and not lose connection. For the price, they are close to perfect.",
          "TLDR; Sorry Corsair, but this product has some issues.Pros:-Fits snugly, doesn't move around. Maybe a little too tight for some folks with big heads.-Blocks external noise pretty well-Sound quality is decent-7.1 channels-iCue software-On headset controls-Best Feature: Build quality is pretty solid-Reasonably light and comfortableCons:-Microphone is awkward and doesn't mute when pushed back like the void pro.-Battery life for me is about 5.5 - 6 hours, so it doesn't last my work day or extended gaming session.- Worst issue: Sound cuts out and drops off like crazy. I can't go further than 5 feet from the dongle or it drops, intermittently drops, or has static. The voice prompts get annoying when it does that too because it'll keep saying \"Link Established\" and other stuff. My older Void Pro does the same thing but its range is about 15 feet.-Microwaves render it inoperable or drown out whatever you're listening to with static if you're within 6 feet of one while its cooking something.-If you tap the right ear cup, you can hear the speaker assembly inside rattle. The left ear does not do it.My experience:I am a fan of Corsair products, however this headset doesn't quite hit the mark. I have two Corsair headsets (HS70 and Void Pro) because the battery life in either one doesn't last as long as I need it. I decided to use this headset for work primarily and the Void Pro for gaming mainly because of the Mic. The iCue software is good for managing the device and keeping updates flowing, and the fact that it has options for 7.1 is pretty cool although I don't use it lol. The connection drops and the static prevent me from recommending this product. I have two other bluetooth headsets of different brands that do not have the interference issues the Corsair ones have.",
          "The headset is decently heavy, but after 2 weeks or so I built the neck strength to game for hours. However, the battery life is horrible, and you likely have about 4-6 hours of solid performance depending on what you are doing. Also, when plugged in to charge, the headset is unwearable. You can't wear the headset while plugged in for sure. That is not the reason why I am writing this review though.The icue software (essentially required, as the 7.1 surround sound needs to be activated here) is amazingly awful. I built my PC and this software is the worst piece of software on it. The worst part is that in order to set up your headset (change to surround sound and disable the GOD AWFUL VOICE PROMTS AND STATIC) you MUST install the software to change it. Seriously, who thought the voice prompts were good? Having a robot woman constantly talk into your ear like its Cortana or some bs talk about the sudden noise increase, or if the power is on or if its powering off, or if the mic is muted, etc. is unbelievably annoying. Sounds like a rushed \"quality of life\" extra to me. Luckily, you can change it through the icue settings to disable voice prompts, but even the beeping can be annoying. If it was an option, I would disable the low power noise beeping because around 20-25% of battery, this loud beeping noise repeats every 10 seconds until it dies, but of course, the software does not allow you to change this. Imagine the poor soul who couldn't change the setting for some reason and had to hear the robot woman bleed their ears out. Jesus Christ the icue software is a giant turd. I am disappointed that I have to reinstall this POS every time I have an issue with my headset. That's right, I uninstall the icue software IMMEDIATELY because the longer the software is installed, the more issues come in. And every time you have an issue, the corsair service is also awful. Its funny to look at the bottom of every page on the customer service self-help pages, as just about every page has \"25/7834 people found this helpful\", like your software definitely wasn't the issue here...What sucks more is that the headset constantly has issues with connecting and with balance quality. I am currently using the corsair service to RMA my product as the bass in the left ear has stopped working. I have used every solution available (uninstalling drivers, reinstalling drivers, physically seeing if there is a problem with the left ear, etc. etc. etc.) and with no luck, I may not be getting a replacement for another 2 weeks.That being said, the noise cancelation is quality and the sound is very, very good. I live in a loud house and it has helped immensely. What's better is that with every purchase, there is a 2 year warranty so you can RMA on the corsair website to get that quality back, or, until the headset likely spontaneously has another issue that needs another RMA request. I really wish corsair would spend more time on the product and especially on the icue software, because the issues are constant for a product which could be really good. I will continue to use this product because there is an option to replace it and get it new, but I definitely would recommend to look towards a different product for a friend.Writing this was therapeutic. I hope you have a good day.",
          "The sound quality on them is really good and you get some good volume out of them too. It does have a few draw backs, if i turn them on and connect it to my phone with Bluetooth and turn off the headphones for some reason they still die and i have to recharge them. And i wished they would send you a spare fuzz cover for the microphone. 4 out of 5",
          "I've been looking for a good headset, preferably wireless, for use with video conferencing and call center telephony work on two different computers. This was my fifth attempt of both wired and wireless, all the others fell short for one or more reasons. And I think I finally have a winner.  I've had these for two and a half days.I'm not a gamer, but all the headsets I saw advertised for more general use or conferencing-specific fell short of a couple critical needs for me. My home office has an AC in the window this time of year, and there is an active passenger  and freight rail maybe ~100 feet from my window and the horns blow right across from me. So I need something that provides both sound isolation for my ears and noise cancellation for the mic. So that means over-ear, not on-ear, and not a cheap set.These are not lightweight. But they are well balanced across the top of the head and the grip force around the ears is firm but not tight. Which is doubly good because I wear glasses. I'd call these glasses friendly.  Unlike one of the others I tested, the buttons are placed that I do not hit them when putting on/taking off the headset, so they're intelligently placed in that regard. That said, the buttons could be placed better. Charging port should be on the right can with the power button, then the mute and volume controls moved down on the left, closer to the mic. Speaking of the mic, I wish it was a flip-up mic rather than a fixed-placement plug-in with a gooseneck. Flip out of the way IMO is superior to unplug out of the way.Sound quality is very good in, and so far no complaints on the outbound audio (one 8 hour call center shift). Audio was tested with voice, music and YouTube prior to use with work. Don't ask me for a frequency range comparison, I'm a middle aged guy who used to play Led Zep, AC.DC and ZZ Top too loud when younger, plus motorcycles... (no hearing aids, but my hearing has suffered.)I did not rate the noise cancelation function because I don't know how good it is, if it's even there with the iCue software not running.About that iCue software... imo that's the worst thing about this. I get it that for some functions it's needed, such as the virtual 7.1 surround, EQ, and a couple others.  But other settings should be either on the headset or accessible within the regular drivers, such as the idle timer. Fortunately, it turns out that for my use I don't actually need the iCue software; I can't install it on the laptop I use for work. I was therefore concerned about the idle timer turning the headset off when not in active use, but it appears to be not a full power off, but rather a low-power standby as when I tested prior to actual use after letting it sit idle for an extended period of time I got sound within less than a half second vs no delay when in active use. And on my own PC the iCue software really, REALLY bogged things down after the post-install restart.",
          "Great headphones. You hear everything very clearly, footsteps loudly, omni directional. Very comfortable as well, but not well suit for those with bigger heads as the headset if pretty small. Appreciate the ability to use it as a standalone headset for just listening or gaming and having the ability to detach the mic or attach it as necessary. My main gripe with is that the USB adapter to plug in to the PC was causing some issues with Discord and other products I have connected. When I would join Discord calls, it would make it take upwards of a minute for the call to connect and for people to hear me or for me to hear them, making me assume that Discord was the issue but when I swapped to my original headset after this one died, I was able to determine it was the USB adapter causing the issue for the headset. Not sure if that has to do with my motherboard and the adapter not really liking each other but it can be minor to some. The main deal breaker for me was when I was in the middle of a game and my keyboard got disconnected several times while using the headset. That was the main deal breaker. Again, not sure if it has to do with my motherboard and the headset or what but that was a deal breaker and required to me return it. Great headset and worth the money, yes, for sure. I loved it. But with the interference with Discord and causing connectivity issues, I had to say no to a great headset.",
          "If these were made with quality components, I'd rate them 5 star, but they are made cheaply and will break. The sound is good, definitely appropriate for, or slightly better, than the price point. They are comfortable to wear and are pretty easy to customize to your liking. The battery love is decent and the detachable microphone is nice if you want to use a standalone mic. Where they fail is that they do not last very long, I've had these for 18 months and have already had two replacements. If they are not being used, they are hung on a desk clip, no heavy handling or anything that would increase the likelihood of breaking.The first issue was that one ear cup snapped off. The second issue was they stopped charging and wouldn't hold the charging cable in place. There was another issue where the side covers just above the ear cup fell off, but I didn't claim on that. The first issue was covered under the extended warranty purchased via Amazon. It was super easy to claim and got an immediate gift card for the full purchase price. I used that to buy the same set, which turned out to be a mistake. The second issue was covered under the Corsair warranty and took weeks to finalize and get a new pair sent.When they are not broken, they are worth the money. However, given the durability issues they have, I wouldn't recommend them. If you do decide to buy them, definitely but the extended warranty because you'll need it.",
          "I work from home and am a casual gamer. I've owned a wired Corsair gaming headset since 2017 and really, really liked it for both work and gaming. So when I finally decided to upgrade to wireless in 2022, I immediately came to Corsair and found/purchased the HS70 Pro.Pros: The weight, fit, and comfort of the HS70 Pro are all A+ from me. Setup was flawlessly smooth. I had sound range all around my home. Given how long my corded Corsair headphones have lasted with zero issues, I have high hopes for these headphones.Cons: The battery life is the most disappointing. I got maybe 8-10 hours out of my first full charge vs. the advertised \"up to 16\" hours. I did not need Bluetooth, but do wish this headset had a similar battery life indicator. There is also some static/white noise when on, more noticeable when the microphone is plugged in, but I do not find it distracting when I am on a video call or playing a game.Overall, despite the battery performance, I think these will suit my personal needs. I would recommend them!",
          "Am I search for better gaming audio, I bought these thinking there were probably going to be decent. I was correct, the audio is excellent, same thing for the microphone, and the bass is very crisp. However, the fact that this headset charges using micro USB gives me doubts as to its longevity because of the nature of that port.Another issue that I noticed with this headset is that the battery life is actually quite poor, it says 9 hours, but it's actually more like six. What's interesting is that this isn't an isolated observation. I wish Corsair would sell us or at least provide us with the details as to buying a larger battery, because I would be more than happy to install a larger battery pack to alleviate the issue.Also, this headset has a bit of hiss and it does hurt my head even when extended all the way, something to do with scalp tension I'm presuming. For extended periods of time. It's usually comfortable, but sometimes I do feel that its clamping force is a little too strong, like my head is in a vise. For reference, I have to wear an XL hat and it barely stays on, I have an extremely large head. But it fits my giant ears.",
          "First off, to make a long story short, id like to say that if you need a pair of multiplatform gaming headphones, that do simultaneous audio Wired+Bluetooth. This is your headset.The reviews for this headset scared me away, and this further proves that you cant trust what reviewers tell you. You have to form your own opinions. So finally, after months of looking, and coming up empty handed or unsatisfied. I landed on this. And i couldnt be happier.This headset does exactly what it claims, and does it very well. I listen to podcasts via Bluetooth on my phone, while gaming on PS5. And can hear both audio simultaneously. Thats all i wanted it for, but got ALOT more out of it. The microphone quality is clear, the sound is great, and the comfort is phenomenal, you know a headset is comfy when you forget you are wearing one! (And my head is the human embodiment of a boulder).The iCue software on PC is great, and allows Mic Monitoring, Custom EQs, and Sound Profiles, which is great as well. I didnt mess with it too much though. It seemed perfect as is. But its there if you need it.My only complaint, and its very minor, is the volume knob controlling the Mic Monitoring levels. I wish this couldve been done on the iCue app, because you need to turn the knob almost all the way up to experience good MM, but that in turn makes everything else extremely loud (yeah this headset is also plenty loud!). So having to fiddle with game volume and chat volume individually rather than on the headset made it a little annoying. Not a deal breaker at all though.Overall, i rarely if ever write Amazon reviews. If you need a dependable headset for $80-$100, that is also multi-platform compatible (I didnt try it on Xbox or Switch, but i dont see why it wouldnt work), i honestly cant think of a better pair. And big ups to Corsair actually filling a very niche market, of people wanting to use Wired+Bluetooth to game. I hope they make a Gen 2 of this headset somewhere down the line. Maybe a fully wireless version?",
          "Got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he said they work perfect. He uses them to play video games on a PC, so it's a nice gift option, plus his reaction when he received them was priceless. \ud83d\ude01",
          "I have had this headset over a year.  Still works as good as the day I got them.  They are comfortable and not heavy.  The microphone is magnetic and tucks in.  You can take them off and let them sit around your neck when you are not using them.  They do pull your hair though when taking them off your next to put back on your head",
          "Bought these a year ago, been using them since. Most headsets I buy they break within 6 months, either the puff comes off or the ear piece, something breaks. But this headset hasn\u2019t budged, I\u2019ve dropped it the most too, being away at college I had to move them around from building to building and they\u2019ve withstood. Using them for Tarkov recently and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it. Great mic quality, volume buttons. The only thing I dislike is they need to specify more about Wireless and Bluetooth. I bought the Bluetooth version and wanted the wireless, Bluetooth is for phone and Xbox like devices. Not for me, but corded is fine, no latency.",
          "Pros: great sound quality, comfortable, affordableCons: no way to know if mute button is on or off, may have lower wireless range than advertised, battery life a bit lowI bought threat headphones so I can walk around the house while still listening and talking on work calls. Really comfortable and not too heavy, these headphones are giving me a good first impression. The range seems to be a bit lower than advertised, they say about 40 ft but they disconnect when going from my pc on the second floor to my first floor, although this may be related to having the floor in between. The mute button is a press button, it would be better if it were an on/off switch or having an indicator light as you cannot know whether it is muted. The battery life is not as good as advertised, definitely not 16 hours, maybe 8 or so. That said, you can still use them while they are charging. Overall pretty happy with the purchase",
          "Love the fit and feel of this headset.  I better because I wear it for  8 hours while working from home.Then after work, I play World of Warcraft, game sounds in the headset as well as  using it in Discord.  My friends say I sound like my self over discord.  I got this headset because i is discord certified.  Reason for buying a Corsair head, I had tried a Logitech with blue voice it was great except for discord. The logitech with blue voice they said I sounded distance and unlike myself.",
          "Overall I think this is a great headset. The mic is amazing for being wireless, and the included muffler thing is a nice touch as well. The sound quality is comparable to that of high-end headphones; it's clear, crisp, and good sounding, not too much to complain there. You can always adjust your settings in the iCUE software which is also good.The main caveats I've had are with the connection, the swivel, and the button varietyConnection: It's stable when you're in the same room as the receiver. However, when I left the room, the connection would start to break and falter. It's not too big of a deal as it still works fine if I'm just sitting at my desk, but when I go get something in another room, I would very much appreciate if the audio kept playing.Button variety: I wish there were a couple of extra buttons on the side that I could program in the iCUE software. It's an easy software to use, and the inclusion of extra buttons to either read out info or do an action would be greatly appreciated. It would also be great to read out the battery on the headphones, as I have to open iCUE to check how much battery it has left.Swivel: It just doesn't swivel, I wish it would but it's not too big of a deal.Other than these three cons, I like this headset a lot. The mic is detachable which makes the headphones just look like regular headphones, meaning you can wear them outdoors without making yourself look weird. The earcups are nice, soft and big, and the top headband is also very soft. The entire inner structure is made of aluminum, which makes the build feel strong and unlikely to break with regular use. The voice prompts are nice to let you know what's going on, especially the inactivity prompt.Good job Corsair, I would definitely recommend this wireless headset to anyone with a tight budget.",
          "This is the second pair of Corsair headphones I've had and so I am starting to understand Corsair's headphone quality focuses on a lot of bass. I've gotten used to expect crisp/clean audio being a characteristic of good headphones, and from what I'm hearing these aren't like that. At first I thought \"ugh\", but after a while I appreciate the overall sound coming from them. Man, watching movies on these really immerses you in it. You hear everything and it feels like good surround sound. It also delivers when playing music. It brings out a lot of the instruments/elements of music that a lot of times I wouldn't really hear/pay attention to with other headphones.I think the microphone only works through USB, but don't remember since I only used it once while testing and it only has one cable to connect and that's headphone jack. I do know the mic worked perfectly for me which impressed me. All other headphones with mic up until now (even another pair of Corsairs) the mic was practically useless. Too low/muffled with too much static to really hear me for some reason, but these work great. Obviously not studio quality but still good enough for general pc usage.They're very comfortable also. The padding for the top of your head is very comfortable and the inside of the earpieces offer a lot of room for your ears so they go around your ears and aren't on top of them. Love the volume control button placement, and also love that it has bluetooth functionality.",
          "It's not too bad, though I'm surprised the surround sound wireless headsets have gotten way more expensive since I was last in the market, I paid $60 for my old Logitech G930. Not having any programmable keys on the head-set is pretty annoying coming from a headset that had it, but if you've never had it, you wouldn't even notice. The surround sound that comes with the iCUE driver is pretty bad, so I'm using Windows Spatial Sound (as the software suggest even though I have it enabled already) and that seems to work pretty well, though I'm no audio expert. Also, the range is very poor if you set-up the receiver the wrong way. My desktop has a few USB ports on the top of my case that I was using previously so I figured I would use the same port with this headset. Well I was very disappointed the first couple weeks because the range was pitiful. I couldn't walk more than 10 feet behind a wall without the connection dropping out. I thought about how if the receiver was oriented horizontally instead of vertically, maybe it would send the signals horizontally instead of vertically. When I did this I could walk half-way across my house without it dropping out so no complaints there.Overall, pretty good for the price, though still a little steeper than I would prefer. The audio doesn't drop out like my old Logitech G930 did, battery live is pretty good, sound quality is pretty good, my wife complains all the time that I can't hear her when I have the headset on so either it's got pretty good noise cancelling or I have bad hearing. :shrug:",
          "Sound is good base is decent much style is annoying.",
          "I absolutely love this headset. I ordered it after looking at many reviews online and it appears that it has been revised or this package just comes with more features. I thought it had micro-usb, but I am happy to report it charges via usb-c and came with a high quality braided cable. The included aux cable is very nice and flexible and also braided, but be sure to follow the directions to plug the headset end into the headset. I forgot to do this and was having some weird audio issues with the microphone until I corrected it. It also came with a microphone wind cover (the foam thing on the mic) that completely gets rid of the issues some people were having in windy conditions or when they speak loudly.The sound quality is amazing for the price point, with clear highs and good bass. It won't blow you out of the water like a proper surround sound system with high-end speakers will but it sounds very good and I really like listening to music on it. For a comparison it is most definitely ahead of AirPods in sound quality, so if you are looking for a good headset and like AirPods quality level this will be a good upgrade. I haven't had a battery issue yet because I haven't run it all the way down, but I've heard it lasts about 15 hours.Comfort is best in class. It lists snugly on my head and won't fall off easily, without pressing my head like a vice. The metal construction for the headband is very strong and I don't think it will lose it's ability to stay snug on my head anytime soon, but I'll update this if it does. Build quality is phenomenal, it is very sturdy, all foam pieces feel thick and I know they won't compress with time. I feel the headband on my head but it is very light and won't become uncomfortable or anything after long play sessions. The only issue is if you run hot the fake leather ear cups may become decently hot after a while, but I'm just sitting in my room with the fan on and it doesn't happen to me. Might not be fun in the summer heat though.The looks of it are great, it doesn't look like a gamer headset or anything and I love that the mic is detachable for when I don't want it. I really like the matte black look and it just looks really nice and feels high-quality in person.The microphone is good, albeit not the best it could be. My friends have no problem hearing me and I sound clear, the sound just sounds slight robotic and makes my voice somewhat lower and slightly flatter when it loses some of the high notes. I hope future iterations will be upgraded since microphone components aren't incredibly expensive and quality would benefit greatly. If Corsair decided to be really nice they could even sell a better microphone since it is detachable, but I doubt that will happen.To compare it to other headsets I've owned, it is the best I've ever had. I owned the first generation turtle beach stealth 700 and can't speak for the second gen, but this stays on my head much better, had much better sound quality, looks much nicer (much nicer than the second gen turtle beach's too in my opinion), and is constructed much better. The second gen turtle beach have usb-c, metal headbands, and probably sound better too so they will probably be a much better competitor though. Like I said, they sound better than AirPods but obviously AirPods are ear buds and are in a different convenience class.A lot of users had reported the microphone not working when using Bluetooth, but whether it's the updated version or whatever, it works perfectly fine for me. I can make phone calls from my phone perfectly fine using Bluetooth. Although, at least on iOS and macOS, only the play/pause of the multi-function button work. You're supposed to be able to double and triple click for skip/previous, but all that does is pause it for me, so hopefully that gets fixed. Another thing that would be nice with a firmware update is adding support for battery indicators in iOS and android operating systems, and making it easier to view in the iCUE app on computer. It would be really nice to look at the connected device and know what it's battery is since it doesn't have a button to say the battery level or something like some headphones do.All in all, this is a really nice headset that is very worth it if you have the money. With great sound, excellent accessories, and amazing comfort and build quality, it will be hard to find a competitor to this headset.",
          "I needed a set of headphones for use with gaming on my Switch.  I use my Switch exclusively in handheld mode so I needed a pair of wired headphones but I also wanted bluetooth capabilities so I could use them with my phone or laptop if I needed to.  I have used multiple corp meeting apps over the past few years (Stride, HipChat, Slack)  and the #1 issue was always the audio quality.  I got fed up with dealing with it and finally had my company buy me a pair of Corsair Void Pro gaming headphones and the jump in quality was amazing so when I started looking for headphones to use with my Switch I knew Corsair was the way to go.  I found the HS70 on Amazon and I almost had enough points built up in my Amazon Prime Credit card account to cover the full cost so I jumped on buying them.I used them for just under a month without issue then suddenly the audio quality was horrible.  It sounded like what you would hear if the audio cable comes partially unplugged.  1 channel was almost completely gone, the other was a bit faint but I found that if I turned on the bluetooth the quality returned to normal but only for a short period of time since the headphones shut off the bluetooth after a short period of time since they aren't making a connection to anything. Remember, I'm using these headphones plugged in with my Switch, not using bluetooth so I shouldn't have to turn on bluetooth to get them to work in the 1st place and never did for the 1st 3 weeks of use.  There is almost no information online about these headphones but I did manage to find something about how to reset them (I think) which involves powering off bluetooth then holding in the mute button for 10-15 seconds and then powering bluetooth back on.  I have tried this numerous times but it doesn't help anything since the issue is not w/ the bluetooth connection.  I've given up using them on my Switch and only use them with my laptop using bluetooth now.As far as using them with my laptop, I use Linux Mint 19.3 and the pairing was painless and they connect automatically every time I turn them on.They are very comfortable, but they are a bit large.  I have adjusted them down to the smallest size they will go and they are still a bit loose on my head.  the Void Pro I used for work was also too big (but extremely comfortable) but these aren't as bad as the Void Pro. I wear glasses and there is no interference there. They don't cause any discomfort due to the glasses, so that's a plus.Battery life seems to be pretty good, I get a few days out of them before needing to plug them in to charge.  I did pair them with my android phone (Pixel 3 XL w/ Android 11) as well to test that out and it works fine although I don't really use them often with my phone.Overall they are a great pair of headphones that work wired or wireless, but I can't recommend them for Switch gaming.  I don't have any other consoles so I can't speak about how that works.",
          "Update: The power/charge indicator is broken, and ive been very gentle with these bad boys, battery life has degraded significantly (i have to fully recharge them every couple hours) and the coil whine has actually faded since the headphones have burned in a bit. They still sound great for a \u201cgaming\u201d focused headset, but they seem to be very unreliable. If they are getting messed up with me being gentle, I can only advise you angry people to NOT buy this device.First Review:Alright, getting started with the headphones (headset since i dont use the mic because i have a separate one) They sound great, and Corsair has one of my personal favorite softwares (right below logitech in number one) which allows you to adjust the equalizer to your hearts content!!! The volumr and other buttons are placed in great places so you arent accidentally hitting them, but they are still easy to get to. And the headset feels premium, great materials, my only complaints about the construction is that they are VERY tight for the first day or two, then they loosen up a bit.The major annoyance for me is their coil whine though, I've had it on my void pros, and now on this headset. Theres also a slight static as well when playing any type of audio, corsair has not been able to figure this out it seems although its pretty basic hardware (i opened my previous void pros up) but i dont want to open these up for such a small (yet annoying) issue.As for connectivity, its great and virtually no noticable latency, overall a solid headset, just fix the coil whine and backround static, it's been 5 years Corsair.",
          "Very good headset for the price. I was shocked. Speakers sound like they are put together well and quality material. And louder than expected.",
          "I bought these because they are dirt cheap, however I understand why. I\u2019ve got two sets, one for me, and one for my son. They are identical, my head will sweat wearing these but the worst part is the battery life. On a full charge the headset may go 6 - 8 hours. If you have a free day and plan on gaming you have to charge these in the middle of gaming and that requires an extra usb port as you can\u2019t play sound through the usb connection, it is solely for charging. It\u2019s also a usb mini and it\u2019s located at 6 o\u2019clock on the LH ear piece so if you have a tabletop headset stand you can\u2019t charge it while on the stand without putting a hefty kink in the cable. Sound quality and the Corsair User Interface is nice, however I\u2019d recommend spending a bit more for logitechs $200 pair. These things get hot!!",
          "great build really comfortable and lifetime dolby atmosphere eq settings yes please and only $40 i got the hs75 xb",
          "I actually bought the Razer Barracuda X before getting these. I had to return those because they didn't have any type of software that I could use to adjust any settings I would need. The HS70 pros have been great for me. They provide directional audio that is more than enough for the games I need. I am a fairly casual gamer that plays mostly FPS games. I am able to track footsteps around me with ease.Pros:- Comfort- Software to tweak settings (Mic Volume, Equalizer)- Detachable MicCons:- Uses Micro USB- Mic quality is fine, but not good- Mic volume is low. I had to used a 3rd party app to increase volume of mic.- Took some time for headset to break in (in terms of comfort)Overall, I think this is the one of the best wireless options that you will get for the price range. There are wired options that outperform this headset, but I wanted the convenience of wireless. I would never go back to wired headsets.",
          "Listen, I bought this headset about 2 years ago and have been using it on a daily basis. I use it for work where I take calls and for gaming. The sound quality is great and the mic is decent. I never had any issues with compatibility. I also used it on my PS4 and PS5.Here is the one thing you should know:This headset is apparently well known for having battery issues. I had a coworker who used it and it stopped charging around the same time as mine did (2 year mark). This could honestly be normal for a charging headset, 2 years is a decent amount of time but my recommendation is to go with the 3 year extended warranty. I am going to be repurchasing this headset with it this time. (Yes, I like it so much I will buy it again).I tried purchasing a different headset, the HyperX Cloud II which is a modern headset but the sound quality and mic quality was not as good and it's much more expensive than this. The HyperX also has a terrible feature where it auto shuts off if no sound is coming in, the Corsair HS70 will only auto shut off if you leave the connection range and it will beep a few times as a warning before it does.My current Corsair HS70 headset does still work it just can't survive unplugged. I did look into changing the battery and in the instructional video I found they pulled out a puffy battery (that is bad) and the replacement did not work until they rewired it. I am pretty tech savvy but I am not an electrician, okay? So yes I could save myself a little bit of money but replacing the battery is a no go for me. But maybe you can do it. :)Pros:-Sound Quality really good (in my opinion)-Mic is decent-Comfortable, can wear for 8+ hours straight and I have sensitive ears-Wireless range is decent-When new the length of battery charge is okay but will slowly decline over timeCons:-Battery will die at about the 2 year mark if you use the headset as often as I do. Around the 1.5 mark it would slowly lose more and more time off charge until now when it finally cannot survive unplugged (but still works).-It is a little heavy on the head which could bother some",
          "Sound is great, with a lot of choices between headset presets and Dolby options.  Unfortunately it's very big, and heavy.  Not for smaller heads or kids.  I usually wear headsets on their smallest setting, but this one is just extraordinarily big.  Like smallest setting while wearing a hat big..",
          "Never tested these for gaming. Know that upfront. I did test the mic, which worked fine.  But I really got these to replace a pair of Corsair Vengeance 2100's. I watch a lot of Blu-rays on my PC (HP Spectre laptop with 47\" monitor), and I presumed the quality would be comparable between an older model Corsair, and a newer. It was not. After charging them, I plugged the dongle in, and powered these on. They didn't fit my small head too well. A bit too loose, actually. I started my new product experience by testing the sound quality with the opening of the Disney movie 'Cars.' Did not sound very good at all. But I didn't panic. Instead, I calmly activated Spatial Sound in Windows 11, and installed the proprietary equalizer software from the internet (iCue Setup), which requires just under 4GB of space; no big deal. I stuck with Disney's 'Cars,' and tested again; this time using the downloaded software's preselected modes/equalizer settings. (Including a movie mode.) But the sound didn't change much. It was still like listening to broken speakers through blankets. I've heard the argument 'you have to burn those things in,' but this was clearly not gonna be the case with these cans. And this was a brand new pair that should have had a crisp, clean sound. Also, the sound would only go up so high. And these things have FIFTY millimeter drivers in them. That really gave me pause.When I tried to vary the individual equalizer settings, I discovered you actually have to pay an additional software fee online to merely change those individual settings. At that point, I had had enough of this bad experience. I cut my losses and returned these in like new condition to Amazon for a refund. I cannot recommend you get these for watching a movie on a PC. Very pretty pair of headphones, though. Smelled nice. I'm left very sad Corsair changed their technology. And I'm also left wondering if people who only use them for games, ever realize how hollow and muddy the sound actually is, in comparison to Corsair's older product line. Sorry to see you go, Corsair. I knew you well.",
          "I bought these for my son for Christmas and he loved them. He is an adult die hard gamer and DJ. He raved about the quality and comfort. After a year of constant use, drops, spills, multiple moves and a couple of chews from his dog they finally quit. He asked for the exact same ones for his birthday so I bought a pair for each of us. Best head set I have ever owned and I have been gaming since AOL dial up. LOL",
          "I bought this for my 16 year old son to use with his XBox One and PC. It would blast year eardrums out at random and started falling apart very quickly (around 2 months after he started using them). They might be OK for someone with low standards and is very gentle on the headset. If your standards are that low and you are that gentle on them, then you can just get the cheap off brand headsets that cost half as much and replace it more often.First, it did have good sound when wired (except for the issue that I mention later). The mic was clean and didn't pick up a lot of background noise or breathing, etc.Unfortunately, it just couldn't live up to what I'd consider pretty low standards for a nearly $80 piece of equipment that uses pretty ancient technology. It was possible to use it, but it really ended up being a wired headset for the most part. It has to be connected to the PC with the USB cable to get the 7.1 sound. When it is in use it will just at random blast a loud sound at max volume and stop working for a few seconds. This seems to happen every 30 minutes or so. Not all of the time, but not a rare thing either. I updated it to the latest firmware, with the latest drivers and it still had the issue. I thought maybe it was the PC, but it kept happening even on a new PC. I didn't bother calling support, so they might know of a magic fix, but that shouldn't be necessary. (I do realize that if you don't report it, they wouldn't know, but this is something that should have come out in QA testing, if it actually happened.) Products should work out of the box as advertised as long as you are following the instructions. Maybe it was faulty hardware in the headset, which I could accept, were it not for the poor overall construction. My biggest complaint by far was that the joint where the headphones are attached to the headband was assembled with tiny screws with small threading going into relatively soft plastic. This joint is where the most stress is placed on the headset and where most headsets tend to fail. Usually it's the plastic headband, but that was pretty sturdy. Instead, it has some very sturdy parts held together with not much more than wishful thinking. My kid is pretty rough on headsets, which is why I was hoping for it to be wireless. \"Pretty rough on headsets\" is basically saying that he doesn't remove it by gently spreading the headband on both sides and lifting it off of his head at just the right angle as all headset manufacturers assume is a perfectly expectation for something designed for teens or young adults. Since it only took about two months to strip the screws out, Corsair did offer to open a case for them under warranty, but I just went with the add on warranty that I got through Amazon since any repair or replacement by Corsair would result in basically getting the same product that we weren't happy with. Better to eat the cost of the warranty than stick with a product that would never meet our pretty low demands.If you already have a pair of these and are finding out that they are out of warranty, I do have some advice. If you use some plastic cement on the joint and put a couple of zip ties joined together over each side, you'll provide far more strength than the screws could ever have provided alone.",
          "If you are looking for a nice headset with good audio, comfort, build quality and connectivity for your Steam Deck, well you found it. You can connect it to the Steam Deck 3 different ways. You can use Bluetooth for wireless, the included 3.5mm braided headphone cable or even a usb-c to usb-c cable (not included) plugged directly into the charging port on the console. Audio quality varies a little between the 3. Usb-c get VERY loud if that is important to you.I got this headset because I want to hardwire to my Steam Deck and chat with friends on Discord via my iPhone connected through Bluetooth. Works perfectly.Don\u2019t let some of these reviews make you think the Bluetooth doesn\u2019t work or it\u2019s not compatible with IOS. They don\u2019t know what they are talking about.I have not plugged it into my PC and changed any settings so I don\u2019t know if configuring it on there will have an effect on it when connected to the Steam Deck. I just know it works out of the box.For less than $100 this is a steal. Try it out. Cheers.",
          "I bought this headset in December of 2020 and now in August of 2022 the wireless part of the headset is a joke. It has to be plugged in at all times and there's a very noticeable buzzing or sometimes ticking electrical sounding noise on the left ear. I know its not the side tones because I turned those off. That being put aside all other aspects of the headset still are great. It still sounds great when it works and is comfortable plus the wear on it seems to be minimal. But the technical issues definitely make me want to look towards a different headset.",
          "Bought these for gaming and I got what I expected. Great headphones with a decent mic. It does die fast though.",
          "For the hundred dollar price point, i would expect great things. I originally just wanted a quick replacement for my dying 6 year old senheiser headphones, and these seemed to stick out to me. Offering new features such as being wireless and having the dedicated microphone seemed like an upgrade. I wanted open back, which these look like, but are not, and not advertised as such, which is fine. After about a month of continuous use i have some complaint.First thing i noticed was they hurt, fairly quickly. The top band would hurt my head, and the ear cups are too shallow for my ears. I already wanted to return them but am too lazy to do so. They can be stretched out to help the top, but i need replacement ear cups. While trying to stretch them i noticed they were also somewhat cheaply built. Not terribly so, but noticably worse than my comparatively cheaper senheisers, given they are simple wired headphones. The pleather ears and top are fine, acknowledging the dimensional issues, but not as comfortable. The sound quality is better, but not outstanding. I would consider it adequate. Battery life i would call similar. Thats probably a tradeoff youd have to take for price and weight. They can last hours by themselves, but should probably be left plugged in most of the time. The plug is not impressive, just being a micro usb that is difficult to put in without taking the headphones off entirely, and likely dangles out of the front port of your computer. They come with a sizeable dongle that must also be plugged in seperate to this cable, which admittedly doesn\u2019t have to go in your pc, but i have no issues with that. The range isn\u2019t a big deal to me. Enough that you can get up to grab something close by, but for me atarts cutting out out of line of sight or further than about 10 feet, however you could likely toy with the location of the dongle to get more range. The controls feel cheap and the volume knob is all but useless, having no detents and not enough friction to resist interference, so i just leave it on full. Most of this i can ignore, however mildly disappointing for the money, but i have to constantly switch which ear i have out to save myself the long term pain, or just find replacement cups or another work around. I should have returned these, but theyre not that bad.",
          "My grandson loves it.",
          "Its simple, the sound quality is great.It has a nice neutral sound with a slight loss of very low end bass.I can game, chat, and listen to music without any issue.Whereas other headsets I tried made the music sound so bad I couldn't stand it.It connects to the PC immediately without any app required.The earhole is big and the cushion is comfortable.The mic is removable which is a nice touch for me since I already have a nice mic on my desk.The design is minimalist which is also personal preference.There's a mute button, power button, and volume slider.Honestly it just does the basics perfectly.Which is wild to say but no other gaming headset (for pc) can seem to get that right.Every other headset is full of gimmicky features and all this noise cancelation crap but when you actually try to use it everything sounds like its running through a tin can on a string.This headset just works and sounds good doing it.Also it gets much louder than the other headsets I've tried.They need to make a v2 for like $80 more and make it have better low bass and charge with usb c.Don't change anything else.I don't want a phone app companion.I don't want bluetooth.I don't want active noise cancelation with an AI that maps my skull.I don't need leds that sync to my fan's leds or my screen.I don't need 35 buttons and a touch pad on the side of my headphones.I don't need a spoiler and two dragons drinking mountain dew on my headphones.Just keep making good straight up headphones.",
          "I was looking for a wireless xbox native headset with a good mic and atmos sound. The corsair checked all these boxes.Pros:Deep head cups for great comfort for big heads with big earsMic sounds excellent, according to players I've asked.Speakers sound amazing, especially with Atmos enabled.Native xbox wireless connection (no need for bluetooth or a docking station)Long battery lifeVolume and mix controls are well madeCons:Mute button function has delay and very very loud \"BOOP BOOP\" sound when muting and unmuting that also interrupts the game/chat audioMute button is small and hard to locate when needed.No way to tell if you are currently muted.Headphone cups are vinyl and found no replacement options, so they get warm over time.Sound volume does not remember where you set it, so I have to turn it down every time I turn them on.Lack of controls, when connected to pc, was surprising. A LOT of obvious controls were missingConclusion:The headset is great if you want great audio performance, both with the speakers and the mic and dont want to bother with aftermarket docking stations. But, there are a few \"quality of life\" details that keep this headset from being truly great.",
          "The second I took these out of the box I knew I was in trouble: swivel mounts above the cups. I spent two hours searching Amazon for wireless headphones WITHOUT any swivels or hinges or other \"comfort\" gimmicks because those are always made of plastic and will always break, and nowhere in any of the pictures did I see these.Another massive issue is that these seem like something for children. I don't have an especially deformed head but these things grip like a vice. It's amplified significantly by the lack of foam protection on the cups themselves. There's only half an inch at most, which is naturally reduced when you put them on; combined with the Jaws of Life-level power of the set, it means your ears are squished--mainly the top part that's the most sensitive. After an hour the pain is enough to make these unusuable. I'm not going to spend over $100 on something I can only use occasionally, I was looking for an all-day thing here.But if either you don't have ears or you possess a narrow skull, these will knock your socks off with sound quality. Even better: the software is SIMPLE. Razer and Logitech have the most obnoxious turds with eight thousand extra things they want to sell you, but Corsair software is one quick download and install, then you instantly have an EQ and settings. Ezpz.These would have been 5/5 if they didn't want to crush my brain. 2/5 only for the sound quality as it is though. Now I get to spend more hours shopping for another pair, yay!",
          "Excellent sound, remember it's a wireless USB dongle, plus it's comfortable.",
          "The mut happens Instantly! I have tested this several times. The notification of mute and unmute are almost a 2 second delay.The earcups are the right size for my large ears, and the clamping pressure is just right to keep them on and not give you a migrane. The set is a little heavy at 13.4oz (380g) but honestly forgot they were there after 30 minutes. They are open back head phones and thus they aren't super bassy, more like set of old korg instead of beats by Dre. Chat is crystal, and the mic sounds great.I don't like the power button. Tap for the headset to laugh at your vain attempt to summon it, press too long to enter pairing mode. You have to press and hold power just long enough to turn on, but I am sure another button on the pcb for pairing would have broke their budget. Luckily enough when the xbox powers off so do they automatically. Not a fan of the clicky volume wheel where I am convenced one click equals 1%. Lastly is the range. At 30ft (10m) , covieniently how far my fridge is from the xbox, the signal gets distorted. Problem is the signal never seems to undistort when you come back. Meaning you have to fight with that age old enemy the power button to power cycle and \"fix\" them.Still better than the others I've tried, and what I expected from the price point.",
          "I actually wanted to give this headset a second chance, so I ordered a replacement, both had the same issue.This headset is full of inconveniences,If you just need something to use for gaming, while using discord on your phone, or use on a single device, it's passable.But the big selling point is the compatibility with multiple devices.And this headset has some MAJOR design flaws that make that hard, I'd start with the more common obvious ones.This device DOSE NOT support bluetooth aptX!What dose that mean? well if you're looking to use bluetooh with your PC, you'll be able to pair up just fine,But if you want to use the mic, you'll need to switch to the classic 'hands-free profile' that will tank the quality of both the mic and your listening audio, and you'll fell like your using an old landline.Also the device will have a bit of lag too, so it's not adequate for Bluetooth gaming.(Supports SBS and AAC codec)Second, the AUX port seems to be wired incorrectly, if you plug in the included aux cable, the audio will sound weird, and part of the audio channels will be missing, (much like if you only partly plug in your headphones)You can fix this by Turing on Bluetooth (for some reason), but after a few minutes of no BT device being connected, the audio problem will return. I've found that plugging the aux cable in about 80%-90% gives the correct sound.And lastly, again related to AUX, It seems the faulty wiring is prone to interference or feedback from AC powered devices, when a USB device is connected.For example, If I connect to my PC via USB, and try to connect to my docked switch, I get a really loud buzzing, and it even bleeds into my mic line, so everyone on discord hears it too.and I can tell that it bleeds into the mic line, because even if I use the hardware mute button on the headset, it still goes through to the mic.But again, this only effects AC Powered AUX devices, and it's not limited to my pc:PC (USB) + DockedSwitch(Aux)=BADPC (USB) + SwitchHandheld(aux)=FinePC (USB) +PS4 Controller(aux) = FineSwitchDocked (USB)+TV headphone port=badLaptop(USB)+SpeakerHeadphone port =BadPS4 (USB) + Powered DAC (AUX)=badIt's really annoying and limits your use cases.-----Long story short, if you have a very simple setup,Like you just want to talk with your friends on discord while playing PS4 games, you could connect to your PS4 controller for AUX audio, then to a PC or smartphone for interference free voice chat.But at the end of the day, this headset could have been so much better if they just fixed the AUX problem, and added aptX(I tried multiple devices, multiple Aux labels, multiple usb ports/cables, and even two separate pairs of headphones.)But at the end of the day, it comes down to what you're using it for,The mic is a little above average, but not great.Audio quality is 'Fine', at least PC gets EQ settings, but you can't save them back to the device.It will still work for very limited use cases, but unless you want to lock yourself into those, your money may best be spent elsewhere.----Edit 04/02: I heard back from corsair support.---They claimed this issue is by design, The headset is only made to be used with a single wired device, along with one bluetooth device.And that using AUX and USB together is not supported.This is never mentioned in the listing,Sure my use case is not common, but if you say it supports 3 connection styles, and don't mention the exclusions, I feel that's a little misleading.",
          "I bought these to use with a PC and an Xbox wireless adapter which is where my rating comes from.  Sound quality and mic quality seemed good.  Comfort was great.  I loved how these felt while I was wearing them.  The earpads were thick and soft.  Also, the thing I really liked about this headset when used with the wireless adapter is Windows 10 will recognize when you turn the headset on and change your speaker output to headphones and will switch it back to speakers when you turn the headset off again.  This is not something easy to do with any other headset.However, when using this headset on a PC the volume of the headset resets every time you power cycle them.  So, every single time you go to use it you have to adjust the volume.  Also, the microphone monitoring (sidetone) turns back on if you have previously turned it off every time you power cycle the headset.  These two issues are really annoying.  There should be a memory setting to keep the volume and mic monitoring where you have it set.  I understand mic monitoring can be a useful tool but I do not want to hear myself and my environment coming though my headphones.  I am using them to chat in games occasionally and not to stream from or talk into for hours so I just don't want the mic monitoring active and it is annoying turning it off every time I use the headset.  I am guessing these are not issues when using the headset on an Xbox but I am using it for PC which is supposed to be a supported use case.  The 7.1 surround is even PC exclusive.  Also, there is no equalizer settings or anything else you can change when using these on PC.  Some of Corsair's cheaper headsets have equalizer settings you can change on PC in the icue software.  The only thing you can do on PC with these is update the firmware.It is possible a future firmware could address these issues but I kind of doubt it as I am not sure they are even considered bugs.  The reason I believe this is because the volume wheel on these is like an infinite wheel where there is no start or stop point.  You can just turn it forever which means some sort of software or programming needs to keep track of where the volume is at rather than the position of the volume wheel like on other headsets.Anyway, there were some nice thing about this headset.  The automatic speaker/headset switching is really nice in Windows.  I wish all wireless headsets could do that but I believe it is because you are using the Xbox wireless adapter that makes it possible with these.  Unfortunately, for the way I want to use a headset the volume and mic monitoring issues are not something I can live with.  I would give this a 3.5 out of 5 if I could.",

          "While I enjoy this headset for the most part, there has been some negative qualities.Before I get there though, I do want to say that these are comfortable. I used them all day and my ears never hurt. I use these for both PC and console play. The sound quality is really good on all platforms I play on. The 3D audio works well for PC and console. And I have yet to receive any complaints on how I sound when using the mic.Now to my complaints.First, you get two different experiences based on if you use iCue or don't use iCue. For some reason if I don't use iCue while using these I get a lot of background static noise, as if it has some kind of listening mode turned on. But that's not an issue if iCue is running.Second, I absolutely hate the voice assistant saying \"power on\" or \"power off.\" It's unnecessary and it's annoying if you have some kind of audio running, it talks over it.Third, it seems that the headset can't tell when I have audio running at times. I'll be watching a video and randomly it will say it's going to power down. I've even had this happen a few times while playing a game. So I'll be listening to something or in the middle of an online match and I hear \"powering down initiated.\" Then I have to press the power button once to stop it and it then says \"powering down stopped.\" That's really annoying when you're watching something or in the middle of an online match.",
          "After about 3 months these broke.  The plastic binder used to hold the metal ear piece on breaks and the earpiece dangles.  They try to fool you with a metal slide and metal saddle so you think it is stoutly built.  It is not they just made cheap flat metal pieces then held them together in a swivel that is plastic held by metal screws which everyone knows is cheap and worthless.",
          "I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.  The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.  I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).  The range on it is pretty good.  I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.  However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.  I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.  But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.  Size:  it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).  While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.  When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.  The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.  The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.  And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.  The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.  For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.  Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.  I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.  I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.  So, yes.  Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",
          "I purchased 2 of the used versions of this headset and I knew it would be a gamble. One pair looks 'Like New,' no scratches or messed up parts, only thing missing was a cable but it works just fine. The other pair looked like someone purchased a used version, liked what they saw, took those and set up a return sending their old, beat up headset. Still came out with a decent pair though so that's why I gave 4 stars.",
          "I used the USB version at work and enjoy it so much I got the Bluetooth version for my home pc. The icue software adds additional control.-Easy connectivity, better then the USB version.- great sound quality- great mic quality- extremely conferrable over the ear fit- charge while on use.-charge can last around 6-8 hours"

Everything comes through crystal clear and loud. The headset also includes an independent volume control which is great for me as I need it for my streams. The only complaint I have is that for long period of use they do tend to need an adjustment for comfort on my large ears but the over all fit is great!",
          "I bought these mainly to do recordings/calls for jobs at home. From my experience as a gamer and working years at a call center, I would rate these above-average. The headphones are lightweight, they have plenty of padding for the head and ears, making them great for all-day sessions.The microphone is also serviceable. You're not going to get a ton of depth here and the background noise isolation is decent to block out whatever is happening in a room adjacent to you. I'll probably buy a small form mic cover at some point, which should improve clarity and isolation.The speaker quality on these headphones are also great for the price. I would place them below budget non-headset staples, like the Sennheiser 202, but that's just nitpicking. These speakers have less range, but good bass, and quality pads that won't make your ears get hot.Highly recommended for gamers who want something that isn't too generic or those who do a lot of online conferencing/recordings that is low-profile and has a good mic.",

          "The sound on these is pretty good for gaming, everything is loud and clear such as footsteps and where do things come from, but the mic in the other hand, it has some really weird sound, it is encapsuled-ish and I had to make a lot of changes to make it sound good.",

          "I am a content creator mainly streaming games and YouTube.  I bought this headset it worked great at first the microphone quality was lacking some but what can you expect for a budget headset.  After about a year however the band made a loud sound while on my head then I noticed the plastic band had cracked.  I posted a pic of it.  I contacted Corsair support to file a warranty claim it states 2 years.  This is where it gets good.  They approve my claim but want me to pay to ship the broke headset to them.  (This would result in the product no longer being a budget headset) Then in 3-4 days after they receive it they will send me a new one.  I responded no way.  I wasn't about to pay more, I should have just bought a more expensive better quality headset in the begining (this is what I recommend)  rather than putting more money in a budget headset.  Later they respond and state, if I give them a credit card number, they will send a new one, and a prepaid envelope to send the old one back, then credit my card when they receive it??? Considering I bought this through Amazon I prefer to keep my payment info exposure to a minimum (not sending my credit card number through email) Well needless to say I bought a new headset from another company and will no longer purchase Corsair or Elgato products.  I have an Avermedia capture card that is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. Side note my son has the same Corsair headset in blue and the microphone is constantly crackling.",
          "Way too tight on my head.",
          "I can't say these have been the worst headphones.  The sound was adequate.  However the mic on this thing leaves a lot to be desired.I have had trouble with bleedthrough since day one.  I thought it was because I had to use the splitter that came with it, and maybe there was a short in it.But even when I switched to a new 4 prong 3.5mm to USB adapter with its own soundcard, every single shot I make in my favorite game (PUBG) can be heard by everyone on my discord channel.The mic pics up my voice sometimes, doesn't others.  I constantly have to fiddle with my settings.  Basically it needs to be almost touching my lips with the sensitivity way down and I get the best bleedthrough minimalization and clarity from my voice.To add insult to injury the plastic cracked a couple of days ago, first on one side, then on the other.  I've had these things a matter of months.Like I said, the audio was fine, they're comfortable, they were super cheap (I caught a sale and got them for like $25).They served their purpose but I was hoping to hand them down to my kid when I got a set of Void Pros.  Unfortunately I'm not sure how long they're going to last in her care given they're already cracking.Not Corsair's best work.  I highly recommend Void Pros though :D",
          "It's a ok fit around my skull (which is nice as I have a rather large head, ha) but the earpads squish my ears down and the speaker part grinds against them. After MAYBE an hour my ears are so sore I physically find it uncomfortable to continue wearing them. On a good day, MAYBE 75 minutes, but it's usually 45-60 minutes I have to take them off for a long time. My ears are then beet red and real sore.On top of that, Corsair's boast of this unit's sound quality doesn't hold up very well upon the first listen. It's pretty stock and basically sounds like your average 90s Walmart CD player. Good to see in 2022 that sound quality doesn't improve much for this Corsair model. Also it only came 3.5mm aux jack ready, no USB plug-in. Don't have one of those on standby, you're spending a little extra $ or you're just hosed.Buy this if you're don't really care how things sound or if any headset really fits your ears... but if you like to sit and listen to tunes with hi-def bass or play your favorite games for long hours, please shell out the extra $$$ and find a better headset with more foam in the pads and better sound quality.",
          "so if it's only for gaming these are fine, i'd say not as good as astros a10s but has good low ends.this headsets biggest problems in my opinion is it's bad high ends. it sounds flushed.the bass is really good and mid ends are ok.if you need a headset for gaming only go with these but if you want it for musci also look elsewhere. astro a10s are really good but these arent bad.",
          "BIG HEADS UP: If you don't get the Carbon, it doesn't come with a 3.5mm Y-splitter for PC. It was marketed as Green for Xbox, Blue for PS4, Red for Switch and Carbon/ black for PC. For that reason, only the carbon headset has a Y-splitter for mic use. Although if you get a Y-splitter, it doesn't matter which color you get. Since they all work for any platform. You actually have to read into these headsets a bit to uncover this reason, so you'll miss this information if you don't.So I had these for about a good solid year. I bought them as a cheap replacement for my headsets, as they had snapped on the band and I had no other headset to use at the time. So I got these to use in the mean time. A year or so later and they snapped finally after pulling them off my head. So yeah, a solid replacement type I personally think. I wouldn't get these to game forever on, but definitely good to use.They aren't the best sound wise, if your used to better headsets. However, they are loud enough already and won't have an issue with low sound at all from these. Mic worked good as well from what I was told. So never any real issues, plus it lasted so long I personally think. In fact, it lasted so long that I actually forgot to get a better headset until they snapped. While they are light, it does have a really tight fit at first though. It does ease up over time, but it really was snug at first.Thoughts? A good, cheap starter or replacement type headset to have around.",

          "If you plan to listen to music, stay in discord, or causally use these while browsing your PC then these are perfect. Though when it comes to gaming, these are diplorable with little to no quality base, lower pitch sounds being murky, higher pitch sounds being too bright, and all audio in both Tarkov and Apex is so distant and echoes like crazy.It sounds cheap, like they noticed the headphones sounded quiet and distant so they turned up the volume of bad bass and treble to \"fix it.\" In Tarkov the sound of grass and wind made it difficult to hear about damn anything else, and when I went indoors the footsteps of other players sounded so bright that I wasn't sure what I was hearing. Not to mention the directional sound is weak, only really working in Apex but with the sound feeling so far away you still have to focus on where you are hearing from.It's unfortunate that the targeted use of these headphones is so poor because I was excited to use Corsair for headphones, I figured a big name brand with other good products I use would shine. The build and quality of the headphones is great but the performance where it matters is a HUGE let down. My previous One Drive Headphones were both cheaper and sounded waaaaaay better, with more clear, rich, and directionally honed sound. They made playing games like Tarkov- where sound is a big deal, much easier.I am now choosing Razor as a big brand because of glowing reviews of their Blacksharks from Linus Tech Tips, though they also reviewd more high up headphones also from Corsair and it sounds like those headphones have some of the same audio troubles I found in these headphones which is sad. Even if I wanted to tweak these headphones and see about improving noise with Corsair drivers like they have with almost all of their products, these headphones do not with really only wirless headsets having drivers which is unfortunate.I want to choose Corsair, I love their other products, but I cannot in good faith recommend these headphones. Corsair, you can do better than these and I want you to, I'd pick your other products over competitors any day but I can't on these.I hope this helps other possible customers!",

The midrange is ok but it fails to really lay out any sound field in the music. Good for communication apps as a back up to my other higher end headphones.For reference I own and listen toDT990 Pros, DT770 Pros, Audio-Technica ath-ag1x, Beats EP, Focal Utopia, Sony wh1000, and more.",

This headset here is no exception to that rule.The Corsair HS35 offers a great audio experience for (what I paid for it) 38$! It has a bit of Bass inside of it and when playing competitive games like Overwatch, League of Legends, Rainbow Six and even CS:GO. I'm at least able to hear the other player's when do a certain action, however, with this said, I can't CLEARLY hear them like I do with other headsets, so if you don't mind having a bit more focus, then the audio experience is perfect for you!It came in a very durable box and came with all the needed cords and setup guides as needed. The one thing I think most people should know before buying this Headset is that you can only get the Audio Splitter in the BLACK headset! So don't leave that out!This headset works very well on my Gaming PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and Mobile devices!",
          "No complaints regarding the mic and sound quality. The headphones are made out of plastic, so after a few years it did fall apart and snapped.",
          "The y splitter used to plug in the mic and headphones separately that came with the product does not work. I will have to order this separately before I can tell if the microphone is any good. The headphones sound good and are comfortable. It is just unfortunate that the splitter is so low quality and in my case does not work.",
          "I was in need of a new headset but didn't have $150 to blow like I typically do on a headset. Generally, with headphones you get what you pay for.But I admit the sound quality of these $35 Corsairs are surprisingly good. They have decent highs and bass which is generally what you're looking for in a gaming headset. The middle range tones are flat but they're $35 and designed for gaming not high fedelity audio. And if you don't know the magic of high fedelity headphones then these will sound amazing to you.The connector is a single 3.5mm headphone jack with both sound and mic so you can use it directly with any mobile device that has the 3.5mm jack and use both the headphones and mic. And mine came with a single female to split male headphone/mic adapter so I can use it on my PC which has the mic and headphone jacks separate.The build is almost all plastic so I'm assuming that's where they cut costs compared to higher priced headphones.I haven't used the mic yet.The volume control on the headset is odd and unnecessary in my opinion. Generally these kinds of switches end up going bad so I'm predicting that will be the primary fail point for these.These are seriously the best headphones I've owned for a price point under $100.",
          "These headphones are great, the sound quality is really good but the microphone doesn't really work so great. Anyway used it for about a year and then it just broke in half on the headband while i was wearing it",
          "These sound and feel great. According to buddies I play with the microphone quality is very robotic",
          "I'm not a huge gamer, so I don't really care about the high end quality. These work fine.",
          "I blame my self for not checking to see the connection.  It's only 3.5mm audio mic.  Not all laptop support this, so please check first.  Also if you use some type of audio splitter  \"head phone / speakers with a switch\" Make sure it support Mic and Audio.  If not this will be useless as a Mic headset.I keep these and only use them for the head phone, and purchased a separate USB mic.Also the mic is a little flimsy, and wildly located and connected.",
          "This is the best headset money can buy the sound quality is soooo good and the 808's make the headset vibrate and it's amazing",
          "Cons:The microphone is trash. Voice quality is terrible, picks up all the background noise and breathing. Adds sounds not there, like static or pops? But not constant. Really hard to pinpoint the sweet spot on the directional mic. I've managed to work around this but still have issues on discord/FFXIV. ( Discord is specifically listed as working with this product.)Volume and mute controls are annoyingly placed where you might accidentally hit them as you are putting these on or adjusting the fit. They are fairly sensitive to touch. What I would call \"fiddly\".Pros:Sound quality is on par with price paid ($35)Sturdy construction. (doesn't feel like i'll break it if I sneeze, as my previous Logitech had issues)Nice finish on black plastic, Fabric is soft and durable, foam is holding up months out.Light weight and Comfortable! (the reason I bought these) Fit over the ear and glasses! Very rarely have headaches from wearing these for hours. 12+ Hours. Maybe days?For reference, I am a woman with a tall long narrow head shape. I wear thick plastic glasses.I have not noticed any noise cancellation at all. But I don't remember it claiming this anyway.The cord length is not an issue for me. I think they must have changed the length due to complaints, because mine measured 6'9\" to the connection with another 6 or so inches for the aux and mic split.Had no issues with shipping or packaging.TLDR wouldn't recommend but they are functional enough if you're cheap",
          "Very good headset. Recommend for gaming. Comfortable, clean, and lightweight with that premium feel of quality. It\u2019s just right for the price.",
          "The headphones are soft and can be used for anything even not gaming. They are very comfortable and have rat sound and pretty good noise cancellation. These are definitely worth the 40 dollars I paid and I think they will last long.",
          "The mic connector part wasn't working correctly, it works sometimes. Outside of that the mic is good and the sound quality is good for music. For gaming though the sounds are full of bass and that can be toned back a little.",
          "Not a luxury headset by any means - but it is a big step up from the knock-offs priced in the $30 range.Fit is comfortable for me, sits nicely on my head and doesn't get uncomfortable for 4-6 hour sessions.Sound is good enough that I forget I'm wearing headphones - not blowing my mind but not bad either.The mic volume was super low and it took me a while to get it figured out. I tried a bunch of different apps and settings in discord and window and it was a big PITA for a few weeks.To make it work well I needed to go into the audio driver software on my laptop (for me that's Realtek), and bring up the mic input volume there to about 120%. Raising it in Windows or Discord didn't really fix the problem - it helped a little but sound quality suffered and it never really got loud enough.I also had to turn echo cancellation off in Discord because it was causing problems. I think there is maybe a tiny bit of feedback from the headphones to the Mic - not enough to notice, but enough to screw with the automatic noise and echo detection stuff.I can't speak for the noise cancellation - they are not noise-cancelling headphones and I have a quiet apartment anyway so I don't know how well they block outside sounds. The earcups are porous textile so I wouldn't count on them doing a whole lot. For my basic needs they are fine.Overall I'm happy, especially for the price. Some gamers might find them basic - but they are solid, work well, sound good, and are not trash. For $35-40 I'm very satisfied.",
          "Worked amazing. They are super comfortable and adjustable, it is very easy to mute and control the volume of your headphones. Audio is great as well",
          "I LOVE this headset. I was recommended the Corsair brand by my boyfriend who games with me online. He originally recommended a more expensive pair, but after browsing all of the Corsair options, I settled with this pair and I am super happy! First off, the set as a physical examination is satisfying; they look clean and neat and they fit my head comfortably and perfectly. The noise cancellation is WONDERFUL. The ear pads are super soft and cover my ears completely without pressing on any sensitive parts of my ears and causing irritation. The mic is detachable (which I LOVE because sometime I want to lay in bed with a movie or music). The sound quality is MUCH better than my last [unknown] headset. I used to have my volume at full and still had room for more noise. With this headset, my ears are being comfortably blasted at only half volume. When playing my video game (World of Warcraft), I can always efficiently hear all the sounds of my game, along with the voices of my friends in Discord, at the same time I have music playing on Spotify. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone for any audio need. It is much better quality than I assumed it would be, especially for the price. I am super happy!",
          "Audifonos muy buenos, no me han dado ninguna falla desde el a\u00f1o pasado que lo compre, el material se siente un poco debil pero si resisten, muy buenos para su precio.",
          "I use this product for work, not gaming. I am not a gamer, just a corporate person who does a lot of Zooms. The headphones are great. Very quiet & comfortable. Only two complaints: Nowhere in the product description does it say that the plug is a old school \"headphone prong\" (IDK the real term) and not a USB plug. Would have been nice to know this in advance. ALSO...another negative... there is a very small and easy-to-accidentally-press \"mute\" button behind the left earphone. Furthermore, it's almost impossible to tell, from feeling it, whether it is off or on, you just have to start talking and if the person can't hear you....you know you're on mute. It's pretty annoying.",
          "Por alguna raz\u00f3n lo bolsa de silicatos estaba rota.Son c\u00f3modos, ligeros pero usarlo muchas horas terminas con las orejas sudadas.La c\u00e1lida de micro est\u00e1 bien. Tiene que bajarle ganancia.",
          "I have now owned this headset for 2 years now, its has served me so well and due to the construction quality, you would think I got it last week. The headset has never failed to work and the sound is still as good as when I took it out of the box. I have tried so many other headsets, ($100+ from friends and family) and these sound the same or if not even better which is insane for the price point. Great product by Corsair. I recommend this product to whoever wants a nice headset or doesn't necessarily have the money to spend a lot of money on one. The mic quality is ok, but I use a XLR mic so that part does not matter to me personally.",
          "fair warning. I have a significant hearing loss so my idea of sound quality is unique.these headphones are comfortable to wear. the cloth earpiece is amazingly breathable. with fake leather I started sweating underneath very quickly but these I could wear comfortably without issue. I got these because my prior set was not playing well with my hearing aids. (feedback is no fun!) I wanted to try a more name brand in the hope that they considered that. there was an improvement but not enough to make it useful. the fact that I could almost have them over my aids is what gets a good sound quality rating. I'm running at a high volume because well, I need too and I don't hear any distortion.  I use these just about daily for a year or so, the headband is now cracked and one of the earpieces is starting to break free of the headband. since these are used for both gaming and work teleconferencing. I'm going to need to find a replacement before they completely break.",
          "I work from home and the headset my company provides me with is uncomfortable to say the least. I am on the phones the majority of the day, so an upgrade was a must to prevent headaches.This headset was easy to set up. All I had to do was connect it to my cpu using the USB adapter provided and I was good to go. This headset is much more comfortable and does a a great job canceling out other noises so I can clearly hear my customer.I highly recommend if you need a good headset for work that is much more comfortable that what your company might give you. They\u2019re also probably pretty good for gaming but I do that in a different room so I have another headset for that lol",
          "I have a good system at home and was looking for a comparable system at work. These headphones a decent quality and very comfortable. I have a large head and run into the issue of small ear pads. These are large and the cavity in each pad is pretty deep. The flat black finish all around is great for a professional meeting as you don't want to flashly RGB. The Mic is removable. I found this great on lunch breaks while watching things online over break. The built in volume and mute button is an added bonus. I tend to not use the mute button as there isn't a good indicator that you're muted, just toggle and guess? Good Price - Good Value",
          "I bought two of these one works great the other has audio bleed even with a usb to aux adapter, originally thought it was my motherboard but after disabling all other sound devices testing it with a usb adapter instead of a splitter I was able rule out it being the motherboard.... I tested the pc with a different headset and no problem, wish I found the culprit sooner as its far past refundable. that said amazon would have happily help me get it replaced if I knew that sooner so I'm still giving 4 stars :D",
          "I like Corsair as a brand for their cases and memory products and this is the first item I've purchased from them outside of those categories.The sound tends toward enhancing midrange with only slightly tinny sounding highs. I was surprised that the bass response is decent. (for example in Dream Theater's \"Pull Me Under\" there is a very low bass note in the intro that these headphones pick up it's one of the first tests I put on speakers) but correspondingly the lower the frequency, the lower the volume in the mix. Acceptable at this price range.They feel very solidly builtI have a large head (hat size 8 1/4) with larger than normal ears that lay mostly flat against my head and these headphones are very comfortable for me.The overall volume is slightly louder than my previous set (which broke) of Logitech G430 and was pleasantly surprised that the Logitech USB DAC works when I plug this set of headphones into it (since these do not come with a DAC but rather a splitter to use the traditional mic/speaker jacks on your computer)I would recommend these to anyone on a budget looking for a headset.",
          "I like the price i like the design of it I like how comfortable these are, I like how light weight they are, I love the sound quality on these things, I'm telling ya I've bought alot of headsets i mean alot and it's too embarrassing to mention how many but between animals and my son still growing up we've went through alot of them and over the years this set of head phones have been not only a contender but it has reigned champion of our house for awhile, needless to say this headgear will remain the best headgear we've bought. The sound quality is outstanding I actually check behind me during a game ora movie because it sounds so life like and so real they've managed to take a flat sounding headset and finally give it alot of depth and richness i mean you'll actually look to see what or who is behind you as you play your game or watch your movie it's that life like that amazingly put together. It's tough to find headsets that'll go the distance but this one has, it's even survived the vacuum cleaner i swear to ya the cord was sucked up into the vacuum by mistake of course but it lived and was unscaved from it. I don't recommend doing this on purpose too see if I'm right or serious cuz I'm dead serious I review alot of things and trust me in not into putting out stuff that's not been done or truthful. I enjoy  reviewing cuz it helps people in a positive way so do yourself a favor but these headsets you'll not go wrong with this purchase",
          "The speakers are serviceable, more than good enough for everyday use. The mic is poor quality; it's tinny and muffled-sounding.",
          "I recently purchased the headset on sale on black friday for $30. Now, at first I thought this was going to be another headset that would break in the next 2 weeks, but so far I am extremely impressedSound Quality:I would give the sound quality a solid 4 out of 5, because of the bass it lacks. The mids and highs during gaming are excellent, but sometimes hearing grenades and footsteps can be tough, which is bit frustrating. Then again, remember that I only paid 30 dollars for this headset, so having bass as the only sound issue is actually quite impressiveBuild Quality:I would also give the build quality a 4 out of 5, since the headset is mainly made out of plastic, with lack of premium metals and leather ear-cups. Although the ear cups are a micro-mesh feeling, I actually don't find them as uncomfortable as you'd expect them to be. They feel tight with glasses on, and my ears also do not sweat, which is actually quite nice.Mic Quality:I'd say the mic quality is exceptional. It's not something you'd find on a blue yeti or a professional system, but it works perfectly for late night party chatsOverall, I am really enjoying this headset, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a name brand headset under $35, and is willing to risk bass and some build quality for that price point!",
          "These headsets are actually pretty good for the price. The bad reviews that I've seen are mostly complaining about missing the splitter, which isn't Corsair's fault that the consumer isn't capable of reading which model is specifically for PC and Amazon clearly states this on each model. The headset itself feels somewhat cheaply made, but again, they are entry level. If you take care of them they will last. Sound quality is actually pretty good, again, for the price point. They aren't 7.1 surround sound, but if you really require surround sound you probably won't be using headphones to begin with. I've been using these when playing Modern Warfare and they sound great. I'm not sure that even having 7.1 headphones would make a difference. Having a microphone that is removable is convenient for me, since I generally only use it when playing with friends. I tend to not use it so much unless the team I'm playing with is receptive to teamwork and communication. The mic itself from what I'm told is decent enough. I think really it comes down to playing with the settings to fine tune threshold and volume. Again, for the price, these are actually very good headphones. The cord is plenty long for PC, dare I say too long. If you just bundle the excess and leave yourself a little wiggle room you'll be good to go. I was hesitant to buy an entry level headset, but after using these a little over a month, I can't justify buying over priced ones. If I were to buy another or more expensive set, it would be a wireless model. Oh, and as far as comfort, they do well after a couple of hours. They are light enough that they don't weigh down on your head. Overall a good set for the money. There are a few things to be desired, hence the 4 star rating. But overall they are worth the 30 bucks.",
          "Very good high quality headset for the price. Hasn't given any trouble and the mic quality is passable, with a great range of sound and solid bass. Not to mention the cloth padding won't be peeling off on your ears like other headphones. That in itself makes this option better than most. Great buy, would go for it again."

Told them the problem, they replied asking if I had updated drivers.  I responded and they closed the account with no fix.  Requested help again, they again asked if I had updated drives in which I told them I had downloaded the latest from their website.After a day or two, I reached out to Amazon and had sent the mouse back and received my money before coolermaster was able to reply asking me about my drivers again.If your curious about the mouse, look on reddit for answers to the side button (ability to hold and use the button to use as a mic).  A quick fix was to create a Macro.There are plenty of good products out there, don't waste your money on this crap.5 stars for Amazon for their super quick response.  -5 for the lack of customer support from Coolermaster.",
          "This mouse has so much potential but I believe it's not ready to be a main mouse yet. The side buttons and shape is amazing but the whole feel of the mouse is very cheap. Mouse 1 and 2 buttons feel squishy and have a lot of post travel. Could be my copy but there has been lots of complaints about the clicks and wobble within the buttons. Once they fix these things I could see this mouse being great but until then I wouldn't buy it",
          "Very solid for how much it weighs. Great color, no issues with software, no tracking problems, good width coming from a 502. Again build is very good, but for those who are really peeved by it the right click has the slightest wobble. Left click is sold, and the performance is not impacted so this doesn't bother me at all! Now for many thousands of hours of play time...",
          "If you're looking for a gaming mouse and you have small to medium hands, this is perfect. I've had it for awhile now and the only time I thought about switching to another mouse was when the mm720 came out, which would definitely be more comfortable for my hand. The RGB is alright. You do get used to the holes.Update: Left mouse click worn within a year of use. Some clicks would not register. Would not recommend if you're gaming every day. Took 1 star off.",
          "So this mouse is very lightweight and is good for gaming. I love the RGB lights and it looks nice. It does feel a little cheap and to be fair it was $37 so it was cheap haha. But it feels a little flimsy and the mouse button move from side to side a bit. I ended up getting a higher end mouse Razer Viper Ultimate and I love it.",
          "Muy liviano pero eso no le quita rigidez se siente muy como en manos de tama\u00f1o medio y el cable es muy ligero y nada estorboso. Si se me da\u00f1a lo volver\u00eda a comprar.",
          "Love this mouse.  It has worked out great.  Fits my hand perfectly.  I can't say if it will fit your hand or not, but it fits mine.  I don't like huge mice.",
          "The hump is high enough not to fit palm and fintertip grips great. No creaking in the product and could tell a difference on the downloaded software when I calibrated the mouse sensor adjustment to the mouse pad. Great mouse all around, would highly recommend.",

          "Hand size is 19.5 cm by 9.5 cm. I primarily use a fingertip. I really like this mouse's shape and size. Reviewers on Youtube mention how they don't like the holes on the side, but I really like them. The real issue with the mouse is that there is a noticeable creaking on my left main mouse button. I love this mouse so much that I'll just deal with it, but do know that main mouse buttons are not that good. Personal preference, but I do not like the triangular style side buttons, I wish they were flat like other mice. Nothing wrong with the seller, only the mouse's main buttons are not nice",
          "Been using it for about a week now and I couldn't be happier. Clicking heads has never been so easy. It glides across my mousepad so smooth it's almost unbelievable that I only paid 55 bucks for it.Diffused RGB in the handle is gorgeous. Separately controllable RGB along the center mouse wheel. This mouse is super lightweight. It's a little short and I have big hands but I claw grip so it's absolutely perfect. I prefer this to some mice twice the price.",
          "I knew going in that this mouse would be smaller than what Im used to but still wanted to give it a try and I was in the market for a new mouse after accidentally damaging my Logitech G403 (RIP). The Cooler Master MM711 is a fantastic mouse with great build quality, beautiful RGB and solid frame. My biggest complaint is the hole on the sides where I rest my fingers are slightly annoying and fell unnecessary. Personally I will not be using it as my main mouse and will look into returning it if possible or maybe gifting it to a friend because its just too small for me, I have large hands and have used small mice before but couldn't find a comfortable grip after several dozen hours of use. I would recommend to anyone looking for a mouse in this style and size especially if you think the holes on the side wont be obtrusive to you",

A little bit of creeking when you push on the sides, mouse does rattle when you shake it, but for now it doesnt bother me or hinder any gameplay. The mouse is also sensitive, You might have to adjust the sensitivity in the settings. Otherwise a great purchase for my build.",

          "my overall review for this mouse is really worth the money. i just love the mouse. its damn light. its my first lightweight mouse and im damn okay with it. although it will take time for me to adapt to its shape from a g502 to  this one.it's actually a bit small for my hand (17cm x 9cm). but not too much that it gives me a problem, i can do a palm grip with it but my wrist slightly rubs on my mousepad. so i usually opt for a claw grip, which is perfect for it. the buttons don't feel mushy or wobble as much as people have reviewed, maybe i just got a good batch, who knows. its perfect for my taste. the side buttons on it are a bit closer than to my g502 but its not a concern \u2014 just something i have to adapt to. the RGB is fine but the software to control is a bit wonky, you can tune it but not to a certain extent. not the sellers fault on that, this is on CMs side - just letting you know.",
          "I am using the mouse for gaming and simple daily internet and similer stuff.The delivery was fast and effective, the mouse is great, its shape fits my palm, I have a fingertip grip. It is extremely lightweight (60g) and its cable is flexible and high quality The buttons feel very high quality including the side buttons as expected from such a mouse. The RGB is nice and contributes to the precise setup of the computer and the mouse sensor You can control a variety of features of the mouse such as dpi and various settings through cooler master software and also in rgb in different ways.Highly recommend for anyone looking for a uncompromising quality mouseI really liked it",

          "I loved the MM710 for the weight and fit in my hand. Unfortunately I bought gloss which leaves fingerprints and oil residue after awhile of use. It also made it more difficult to grip. I also own the razer viper mini for 2yrs. This mouse closely compares to the razer viper mini with the size, weight, and feel. I find my self swapping between the razer viper mini and the mm711 often with no issue. The only real difference is the hump of the 711 is slightly higher in the back and the side buttons stick out slightly more. It\u2019s really personal preference. In my experience the software for mm711 is not as good and feels more clunky than razors. Other than that really good mouse.",
          "Very light as advertised and has a nice flexible woven chord.  RGB colors work as advertised and the software from cooler master is very easy to use.  Honeycomb is well done and hasn't negatively impacted use.  I was coming from a very simple lightweight non-gaming mouse so I wanted to stick with something that would give a similar lightweight feel.  I've felt heavier/ more substantial gaming mice and while they feel nice they are harder for me to use effectively with games that require quick accurate movements.",
          "This mouse has claw grippers in mind. I have a medium sized hand and I used this for fingertip. I have to sacrifice the most forward side button to make this grip work. My thumb rests on honeycomb pattern towards the back of the mouse. Build quality, I thought, was better than most of the honeycomb mice but it is made of relatively thick abs plastic. The bad thing about abs is it yellows over time (if you get the white version), it is sensitive to various chemicals, and it sensitive to heat. Mine had warped from heat exposure. I love the rgb on it. Better leds and effects than most of the others. The shape is nice but it would take some getting use to with fingertip.",

          "I've always known my hands are small; can't palm a basketball, fingers have trouble reaching certain flute keys, xbox controllers are uncomfortable, most gloves are too big, etc. But boy oh boy did that minor inconvenience turn into a serious issue when I started computer gaming.I tried a lot of big brands like Corsair and Logitech, but after a few hours always started to get that tell-tale burning in my wrist. I even had to stop gaming for 2 months because of the Corsair.After lots of on and off research about gaming mice for small hands, I kept seeing this specific one pop up. Combed through the reviews, and almost every complaint was about the size being too small. PERFECT.I've had this for months now, and I love it. I can use it for hours at a time, have no problems with the left and right click buttons (which I was worried about because of the reviews), and as a bonus it has RGB to match my setup. I do wish I could slow the RGB cycle down a little more than the software allows, but that's not enough for me to dock a star on something I love otherwise.",
          "Very light and good qualtiy",
          "MM711 is better than the Razer Viper, because the sensor is superior. The shape is also more neutral an unobtrusive, and the clicks are snappier. The honeycomb cutouts feel strange, but I'm getting used to them. My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel, which is pretty uncomfortable compared to Zowie's, and about on par with the Viper. As a scroll wheel jumper, I was better off returning it.",
          "My main is a finalmouse UL2 Capetown i had this to give it a try and sell my Finalmouse, In some aspects is similar and it got RGB but despite of that the buttons wobble a little bit and the clicks doesn't feel powerful enough.On the bright side the cable and scroll wheel feel great, the RGB look sick and it's comfortable enough to not feel the difference between a FM and the mm711, but for me its not an apples to apples comparison having in mind the price breach between the two mice. If I haven't had my cape town first this mouse could be my dream mouse",
          "Light as a feather (feather may weight more). Smooth and glides across the mouse pad like nothing. Will take getting use to. Last mouse was a tract ball type. Wanted one without lights, so if you are looking for RGB effects this is not a go to. If not this is a great mouse.",
          "Loved everything from packaging to the mouse itself.  Spot on great product...",
          "Two issues:One the left mouse button is flakey, occasionally not registering a click.Two something is wrong with the pads on the bottom of the mouse so it doesn't sit perfectly flat.",
          "You know for a mouse with honey comb holes, it is really durable and light. Very nice mouse cooler master made",
          "This gaming mouse was very good why you may ask it\u2019s because the mouse was very light with a honeycomb design that was very comfortable for my grip. This mouse is good for small hands only so I wouldn\u2019t recommend someone with bug hands to use it. Other than that it\u2019s a great budget light weight mouse.",
          "I absolutely love this mouse. If you are a claw grip user it's a no brainer. I can Game on this mouse for hours without feeling any fatigue due to how light it is",
          "This mouse is for my son, he researched, and decided he liked the look of this mouse.  Once we actually had it, he loved it even more.  Good size (he's 13 yo), lightweight for sure, and looks \"WAY COOL\".  He does Fortnite and Minecraft with it, works great!",
          "Great lightweight mouse. The newest revision fixed all the issues they had originally.",
          "Had this mouse about a year and a half before it started giving erroneous double-clicks. Cleaned it and the problem persisted. Switched to a different mouse and the problem went away so I'm confident it's the mouse that is the problem. I expect longer life from my mice. I'm reasonably satisfied with the purchase given I paid a little over $43, but if I'd paid the price they're asking now, I'd be very unhappy.",
          "Me adapte muy rapido al peso es ultra ligero primera vez que uso un mouse asi, muy facil de adaptarse y se siente super preciso en los juegos shooter.",
          "I bought this mouse in 2020 and it work great until dec 2021, the left click is double clicking everything and now i have to change it. Not worth it.",
          "the mouse itself is flawless but the software needed to install to customize the mouse gave me trouble. Not sure if it was the program or my 7 year old laptop but wasn't able to install the program so I am unable to fully customize the mouse. But you are able to adjust the sensitivity strait from the mouse.",
          "This mouse is incredibly lightweight, Half the time it doesn't feel like i'm using a mouse at all, just moving my hand. Very impressed so far, Takes a while to get used to going from a weighted mouse to a lightweight mouse, but so far so good.",
          "As a person coming from the Logitech G502, the MM711 feels like a huge upgrade. Though the price tag may make some people assume the mouse to be cheap, I assure you that the mouse is very high in quality, especially for its price point. The plastic feels very sturdy and durable, the RGB lighting is tasteful, and the buttons have a satisfying feel to them. Though the MM711 falls a little short in terms of the feel of the M1 and M2 buttons, since they can move a little bit from side to side, but this isn't a big problem with the mouse unless you are very nitpicky with the quality of your peripherals.The ergonomics of the mouse is phenomenal and it won't take long to adjust to the shape of it. For those with larger hands, however, you must know that the mouse is relatively small at 11.6 cm x 6.24 cm, so make sure that you'll be happy with that once you get this product. I have larger hands, and I have quickly gotten used to it.Note that using this mouse gives you the feeling of holding nothing. It is an incredibly light mouse, and it was quite jarring to go from the G502 to the MM711.I recommend for those looking into this mouse to just take the leap and give it a shot. You cannot go wrong with this mouse. If you don't like it, just return it and keep shopping, but this mouse is truly in its own class due to its high quality, great ergonomic feel, and impressively light frame.",
          "Great for gaming, but highly recommend getting a bungee cuz on my desk I have a spot where there's a little hole which creates a lot of cable drag, but the cable is amzing tho.",
          "i bought this as a secondary mouse and i love it! my only complaint is that it feels a little weird when you first grab it, and its not great for much other than gaming, but if you are looking for a gaming mouse i highly recommend this",
          "He loves it till this day",
          "This mouse is very comfortable! The clicks are nice and crisp. It glides incredibly well across my mouse pad. Fits the hand well and is suited for people with a more aggressive claw grip. The RGB is nice and has a lot of adjustability. I have tried my cousins model O and it is nice but I like this more. I also came from a 6yr use of a Corsair M65 and this mouse is a great mouse but after playing I feel like my hand cramps up. When I game With the MM711 it feels like I\u2019m really responsive and can jump on target so fast...",
          "It's a good mouse overall, been using it for a month now. It feels good in my hand, it's light, and RGB customization is easy. My one issue with it is the wire. I play shooter games on low dpi so I make a lot of large movements back and forth with the mouse. The wire gets itself tangled sometimes and then I can really feel the resistance so then I have to find a moment to untangle it. It might just be my setup however I didn't have this problem with my previous mouse.",
          "I don\u2019t really use the side buttons, but they stopped working in a way they only worked. I couldn\u2019t do anything else because the side buttons kept on being pressed and they weren\u2019t even being pushed on. So I bought a new mouse; the same.",
          "I like the cord, speed, accuracy, weight, comfort and LEDs. The pads also slide very nice.  The led settings were strange."

I have some issues with my hand cramping when gripping a mouse for a while due to ring finger placement, but the support from this mouse negates it. I've seen questions about grip, but can say its not an issue. There is more than enough grip area, plus it is insanely light.I can't give 5 stars, as the left click button is starting to fail, plus the cord has kinking issues, but if you have cramping issues, this mouse is a must have. And with the price, I dont mind replacing it every year or so.",
          "Decided to get a different brand because my Logitech Hero mouse became unusable due to double clicking issue (that seems to be widely known and common among recent Logitech mouse users).This is one of the lightest mouse in the market. I have small female hands and use a \"claw\" type grip, and this mouse is comfortable enough for me. The wire is a very flexible cloth material, not like the stiffer \"braided cables\". The mouse has a different type of switch from Logitech, which claims to be resistant to the dreaded double clicking issue while being just as comfortable to click, and I believe it. I've used this mouse for over two years now, and I've experienced zero issues. I was kind of concerned of the honey comb looking holes allowing debri to collect inside the mouse, but that doesn't seem to be an issue. The mouse buttons are easy to press and very responsive (I was using a computer from my college and that really put me into perspective on how AWFUL a bad mouse can feel) .One thing to note is that the DPI switch is below the mouse, so you aren't able to swap between DPI fast or \"on the fly\". If you need to swap between different DPIs frequently, then I wouldn't get this mouse.I paid full price for this mouse because I got it when it had just come out. I don't regret it at all and I'm very happy with my purchase. For the discounted price I see right now (29.99), I'm not sure if there's a better mouse than this.",
          "I've only been using the mm720 for a day but it was enough for me to start recommending it to my friends. My favorite parts are the width and the ring finger rest. They add a lot to the comfort for me. The light weight was a bit of a shock at first. Using the cooler master software to adjust the dpi down to around 600 made all the difference though.",
          "This mouse is super unique in its shape and that is why so many people love it. I think anyone can get used to it, Ive never used a shape like this but got hooked pretty quick. the mm720 is definitely a claw/fingertip style mouse so make sure that's your preferred grip style.ALSO I tried both the glossy and matte, I far prefer the matte white coating. The glossy is a bit too sticky feeling for my heated hands haha. If you are unsure Id go with the matte just to play it safe.I will also add, for its price its incredible value. Solid build (people say it squeeks when you squeeze it? Ya a little with some good force but you wont do that while gaming), incredible weight and balanced, awesome stock paracord cable, crispy optical switches with very little pre travel with a bit more post travel (not game breaking) and a top notch sensor. RGB customization is great and you have adjustable lift off distance in the software.",
          "Very light but doesn't feel \"slippery,\" instead feels very precise due to the extremely unique shape that just works for me, unbelievably good for fingertip and stabilized fingertip. I gave 5 stars for brilliant shape alone even with some drawbacks listed below. The great shape also translates well into performanceDue to glossy material, mouse gets dirty very easily (between buttons as well) so you need to keep some q tips and wet wipes handy. However glossy was not a problem for my mouse grip, did not experience any slipperiness and if you do it comes with some superthin grip tape (which need to be trimmed down unfortunately)Subpar clicks for MOBAs or probably any type of click spamming game. I have not yet run into creaking problems as others have said yet 1 month in. The shape of the mouse makes up for the buttons in MOBAs imoTerrible software, overrides other software and you cannot bind side buttons to keyboard keysThere is a workaround macro for this but it requires you to bind side buttons to mouse click which overrides other mice softwareI have no opinion on feet since I replaced mine with tiger arcs instantlyIf above downsides are improved and if wireless version is implemented, this mouse could be worth over $100",

          "It's an imperfect product by anyone's standards. However, it performs well, weighs nothing, and feels very comfortable. Can't fingertip it with small hands. Wouldn't recommend it for palm at all, either. Claw grip should work for a wide range of hands. Fingertip will work for hands medium and (probably) up. I have hands on the smaller side of medium and get high scores in aim trainers while fingertipping this thing. Best build quality? No. Stock grips? Meh. Usable. But the price and performance are top notch. This mouse is rated as the number one ultralight mouse on rtings.com, and there are reasons for it- namely the click latency and weight. The feet and cable get my approval, too. Clicks are dull and light. That's common for optical switches. You trade that for decreased latency. At least that's how it is until optical switches improve (Edit: Razer has achieved mechanical-like feeling in their optical switches). My copy has occasional creaking in mouse 1, but the price/performance ratio is so great I have to let it slide. This mouse needs no upgrades and has been on sale for $35. It's not the most solid because of how light it is, but if this shape works for you, you're going to like it. I did adjust this from a 5 to 4-star review, however, because I do question the long-term durability. Plus the clicks could be snappier. Razer's V2 optical switches feel like mechanical switches and the Viper Mini is cheaper than this mouse. I still really enjoy the MM720 and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is interested in this kind of shape. This is coming from someone who almost strictly used symmetrical mice until I got this one.",

          "Have now had the MM720 for two days. Previously used the MM710 for a few years. Same (very good) tracking sensor as the MM710. Better buttons: the fit and finish of the mouse body is better, and the click feels better to me, and the new optical (instead of electrical) switches are supposed to have longer life and less latency.The shape is very different but I think I prefer this new wider shape, it fits my hand well. My MM720 came with a full set of rubber grip pads (I haven't installed them yet), and a full set of replacement slide pads for the bottom of the mouse. I use the mouse on a fabric covered pad and the tracking is excellent and the motion is smooth and light.The configuration software is much better than the big brand bloatware: you don't need to register an account, and the settings seem to be stored in the mouse firmware which means you probably don't even need the software once the mouse is configured. I'm not particularly a fan of RGB but the configuration is straightforward and the colors are true to what is shown on the screen.I purchased this mouse new for $27 but this is a great mouse for twice the price, especially if you care about light weight and precise tracking. I don't know why the price is so low, perhaps the shape, but this is not a low quality mouse.",
          "This mouse is very comfortable, great for its price, and very light. The only issue I have with it is that the first one I got is continuously disconnecting due to a kink at the beginning of the wire near the mouse cover. The wire protection is great; its like a shoe lace, but the wire under it is very cheap.",
          "The mouse feels great in the hand for people with shorter hands palm grip is very nice, if your hands are a bit longer you'll have to claw grip, but no matter your hand size the width is perfect because of the ring finger rest. The sensor quality is amazing and accurate. The main selling point of this mouse is its weight @49grams its one of the lightest gaming mice. The only draw back other than the unusual shape for some (love it or hate it) is the software. Cooler master has awful software that doesen't update firmware automatically, you also cant find the firmware on the product page, you have to manually look other places online to find it, and only after installing the firmware will the software work properly. Overall its a great mouse and if you can find the firmware online then you'll have a great experience",
          "I bought many mice in my day, but none come close to the quality and the design it has instantly become my favorite mouse to game on even includes grips that you can add if you want",
          "Coming from a logitech g502, I needed something that didn't make my ring and pinky finger numb after 45 minutes of light use. And this knocks it out of the park! That being said,Pros:- virgin ptfe feet. Super smooooooth.-ergonomics crazy good. Rivals a vertical mouse in comfort.- light as a feather. Makes it great for any user, I bought one for my mom who doesn't game and she loves it.- small, but not tiny. I have big hands (8.2in. from pinky tip to thumb tip) and it's still great.- very customizable and easy to use software.- braided, very lightweight floppy cable. Love this. My g502's cable was way too rigid.Cons:-the buttons are poor quality switches, I can see them wearing out before too long. They're perfectly functional though, and the moment they break I'm going to buy another one!- dpi switch button is on the bottom of the mouse. Really disappointed here. No DPI shiff button either, really miss that.- software is almost a gigabyte of storage, and it HAS TO start with windows to apply your custom DPI settings and lighting. Might be an issue for older laptop users who have bulky work software installed.Overall if you're not the most serious gamer boi, this is a great deal with how low the price is. Highly recommend!",
          "The MM720 is an amazing mouse. I expected a lightweight mouse that performs well, but I did not expect the tangible comfort and the extra accessories, especially at this price point. It came with an extra set of mouse feet, and a grip kit. Not really a fan of the grip kit, but it was a nice unexpected inclusion regardless.I've been using the Wireless Pro, and the cord on the MMM720 is so nice, it nearly feels cordless. Tracking on this MM720 with a glorious xxl pad is precise and responsive to flick shots (being light-weight helps). The feet glide very well and don't snag. RGB is nice, except for white.. that looks pretty dirty honestly: All other colors represent well otherwise. The primary mouse buttons are solid and precise with little bounce back. The mouse wheel is nice, and would describe it as lightweight with well-defined incremental stops. The side buttons - this is something that finally feels right with a nice contour where your thumb rests between naturally making selection feel more instinctual instead of an awkward repositioning event.There were only two points of issue I had with the mouse. The first, when cleaning the mouse with a 70% alcohol pad, the serial number on the bottom wiped right off! Not great for an RMA if needed I imagine! The second was a minor annoyance with the Master Plus software. Surface tuning is amazing, unfortunately, after a system reboot, the software forgets the profile saved. I don't know why, but at least it seems minor and a software issue. Doesn't really affect the function of feel over all.Not the biggest fan of the software, but five different profiles can be saved on the mouse itself and then uninstalled. Overall, this mouse really is amazing given the price point and this has become my daily driver. I have been considering whether or not to more in case they stop manufacturing them! I love the shape and weight combo and makes it a unique offering that may only appeal to people like me.. but I think this would appeal to more than those who use claw grip!",
          "I got the glossy white. I really wanted the matte white, but that option is not available. The glossy white doesn't look too bad, but I prefer a more discrete matte look to match my other peripherals. This is the smallest, lightest, and most uniquely shaped mouse I've owned. I decided to get it due to the stellar reviews online, the white color and cable, its light weight, and interesting shape. I can honestly say that I do generally like the way it feels in my hand. I have tiny hands with a larger palm and holding this mouse feels natural. I like the extra width it has to accommodate my ring and pinky fingers, which no longer drag along the table when using the mouse. The stock bottom feet are okay. They glide easily enough, but they are not the smoothest I've felt. I thought I wouldn't like this mouse because I have trypophobia, but luckily the honeycomb design does not bother me.The worst thing about this mouse is the software. Not too many customizations, which I am not used to since I've always gotten a mouse with multiple side buttons in the past. It took some getting used to, but after a while it has become my main mouse. After a year of using this mouse, it is very comfortable to use, and any replacement mouse I buy would need to have a ring finger rest like this one. Be careful when buying the white mouse, because after a while the white cable can show its age.Update:I purchased a black color from a different seller Digital P and although the item is advertised as \"New\", the item came in taped up from being ripped open from previous owner. The item appears clean, but not packaged correctly inside. Obviously not a new item. I like this mouse, but be careful of the seller you purchase from.",
          "The most ergonomic ultralight mouse I've found. Could only be better if there was an \"uberlight\" version with no RGB and no DPI-switcher. Come to think of it, why stop the honeycomb at the palm? Go big or go home, know what I'm sayin' Cooler Master?",
          "This has got to be one of the best mice of all times.If you have a claw or fingertip grip, for $20 bucks (unreal) this is the one you want.I tested a TON of mice and none did it for me. This one did.",
          "The MM720 is an incredible mouse, and is absolutely the best mouse I've ever used.It is a relatively no frills mouse; it has only your basic buttons (left/right/middle click, scroll wheel, forward/back buttons, and a DPI button on the bottom of the mouse). If you're looking for more functionality out of your mouse, this may not be the one for you. The buttonsThe biggest thing for me is ergonomic slot for your fourth finger on the right side of the mouse. I didn't know how much I needed that extra support for my hand until I used this mouse, but now it's something I'll definitely look for in the future. It looks weird and took a couple hours of getting used to, but I can safely say it helps a LOT with fatigue and comfort, especially as a claw grip.This is also an incredibly light mouse. In its class, it's among the lightest (at 49g?). It's noticeable going from non-lightweight mice out there to any mouse marketed as lightweight, but personally, I don't think 10-20g matters that much. If that matters to you, then it has that going for it.Over the years, I've used more than a dozen different mice, mostly from Logitech and Razer, but also from other companies. I've been a claw grip since I was a teenager playing CS 1.6, but most mice out there just aren't designed well for that grip. This mouse is purpose-built for claw grips, and the fourth finger slot on the side helps a ton for that.",
          "I didn't realize this was ultra-light mouse when I purchased it. It wasn't my intention to buy an ultralight, but I'm liking this a lot.  It feels slightly \"cheap\" because of the ultralight material... But I do love the shape of this and the leds. The cord is also a premium bungee-like material that I really like over a normal cord.  Overall, love it!",
          "Luckily I fall into the \"I love it!\" category.  Man, a mouse that doesn't treat my ring and pinky fingers as bums to just be dragged along my mousepad.  The MM720 give them a home, a place to rest, a place to relax.  It's a revelation going from an ambi mouse to one that is ergonomically designed for a right hander.  Your fingers just naturally fall into place.  You gotta feel it to believe it.  I use a fingertip grip (no claw) and went from a Model O- mouse to the MM720.  My aim feels (and seems) improved, without the changing friction of my pinky dragging, along with a solid grip, aim seems to come easier.  The reason why I didn't give it five stars are the optical switches.  They are very touchy (less travel) compared to the more clicky mechanical switches of the Model O-.  Sometimes I'll accidentally press the left mouse button just by gripping the mouse.  I'm sure over time I'll adapt.  Mouse cable is on par with the Model O-, doesn't drag or effect the mouse.  All in all, I'm digging it.  Put all my old mice up for sale, so that speaks for itself.",
          "This jawn fire thoughhhh. My mm711 started to develop LMB miss clicks, you would hear the audible clicking but they wouldnt register which imo is not acceptable for daily use, regardless of the activity. To be fair though, the mm711 lasted a solid 5-6yrs daily driven which seems good in my book.Initially the mm720 felt very unfamiliar and somewhat unpleasant (ergonomically) because of the ring/pinky finger separation but after about 48hrs I was chillin. If this one starts acting up I might buy another one, I love the low-lift threshold that comes on sensors of the MM710/720.Scroll wheel is butter, dont like how the dpi is under the mouse but whatever its something I set and never touch anyways.",
          "I've been a storm spawn user since their inception, and purchased several over the years. Sadly, they haven't been available for years, and the xornet ii was just a downgrade. This, the mm720, has the same shape and supportive feel of the spawn, however it is very slippery and jittery, due to the fact the entire mouse is made of super slick light-weight plastic. As a claw gripper, I find this slick material keeps making my index and middle fingers slip from position constantly. I know their is some kind of tape I can apply, but I'm reviewing this mouse as is. It's the best option still available for spawn lovers. I just miss the rubber, grip, and quality of the original.",
          "I\u2019ve got this mouse 3 times and I\u2019m about to get another one. No I don\u2019t leave them sitting on shelves or something, I\u2019ve used each one till they died on me. That\u2019s the catch, everything is really solid about this mouse, feels great looks great, plays great for gaming on the daily. BUT eventually with such frequent and heavy use eventually something starts to act up. Don\u2019t get me wrong it feels sturdy it\u2019s not bad build quality (Or at least I don\u2019t think it is) it\u2019s great up until a certain point and from my experience that\u2019s about 4-5 months. First one was a double clicking problem I would click once and it would click twice or I would click and it would act as though I was still holding the left button even though I wasn\u2019t. Second one same thing. This time it\u2019s a disconnection issue it\u2019ll be working just fine and then mid game it\u2019ll just stop working for 2-3 seconds. Moral of the story, great mouse, worth the money, and I will be buying another, despite its eventual demise.",
          "The mouse buttons squeak due to cooler master's poor shell design. You can try to get a golden sample but all of their mice will eventually squeak due to plastic rubbing. The easiest way to fix it is to lubricate the \"trigger\" assembly. Get a bottle of silicone oil (recommend: super lube 56104) and hold the mouse up so the cord is facing the ceiling, and then add a few drops of oil under each of the triggers. Click the buttons repeatedly to help work the oil in around any areas which may be rubbing. You may want to repeat this a few times or find other angles to drip oil in between the shell and the triggers. Clean up any excess oil with rubbing alcohol. You may have to repeat this every few months if you use low-quality oil.The post-travel on the triggers is also a bit excessive but fixing it would require fully disassembling the mouse and trial-and-error based on manufacturing tolerances. Something like adding layers of tape to prevent the triggers from depressing after they actuate the switches will work but is very tedious. I doubt most people would notice this since gaming mice generally have travel issues.",
          "\u00a0Super lightweight and easy to move, feels very nice and natural to rest my small hand on it. I love the resting spot for my ring finger. Normally I claw grip mice, but with this one I feel encouraged to rest my hand down flat on it: Kinda pillowy in that way. Long flexible cloth cord. The purple glowy effect is pretty. The scroll wheel is not the best, but it works. I also have to shift my hand a little to use it due to its positioning.",
          "Everything about this mouse is great the coating is great for sweaty hands and sticking, the shape is damn near the best I ever used ( most mice popular recommended mice such as the deathadder or g305 dont fit my hand for a damn causing hand pain wrist pain and my fingers to even become some what deformed). The  Shape fits my hand so good I would recommend it to anyone with somewhat wider hands or who works with their hands for a profession (I have 19.5 cm x 9.5 cm hands), personally my wrists are destroyed from boxing and this is one of the only mice that doesn't make me chose between comfort during hour plus gaming sessions and performance. The mouse is ultra light at 49 grams the cable is also very nice better than any razer or mouse cable I've used ultra flexible shoe lace style cable. the mouse feet are awesome ptfe  feet that are huge my only gripe with them is that when moving up and down the pad they have a different smoothness feel because they have a bit of an edge on them if they were rounded this might help but other than that perfect and I'm sure they will wear in well. The sensor in this mouse is very good only other mice I've used with a sensor I felt was better or on par were the logitech hero line. That being said it preforms very well and the software lets you configure it well from lift off distance to multiple dpi levels. The cooler master software is quite good way better than razer letting you set up macros using keyboard presses even though I dont use a coolermaster keyboard and I dont want to unlike razer which requires you to use a razer keyboard with your razer mouse if you want to set macros to the mouse that use keyboard strokes. My one problem with the Cooler master software is that the profile management and selection could use work, personally my profile names wouldn't save and it seems there is a profile management screens and a profile drop down menu not sure if they are exclusive or if they control the same thing. If they do control the same thing you have 5 profiles if they are exclusive you have about 20-25 profiles I think thats way more than I can see anyone needing but hey I dont have any problems with extra functionality it does need work though. Lastly the rgb on this mouse is quite good nice brightness and color reproduction.only things cooler master can do to improve this mouse- give us a wireless version-revise the feet a bit almost perfect just need a bit of work just adding a bit of slope around the big feet so its more plateau like (not a big deal to be honest mine already started to wear in after a week of use and are almost 1:1 in glide when going from horizontal movements to vertical movements.)-maybe a better scroll wheel with more defined steps (personal preference)-magnesium version to compete with the new magnesium final mice?This is an end game mouse boys who knew cooler master could make such great mice. More people just need to pick this one up and give it a try, though I fear because it isn't the flavor of the month and does not have many of the big mice reviewers on its side like rocket jump ninja we may not see a revision (almost didn't pick it up because of his review but tbh he has a tiny narrow hands the camera angles he uses makes it look larger and made the mouse look huge, its not dont worry. like most other mice reviewers what works for them did not work for me.). PLEASE COOLER MASTER GIVE US THE WIRELESS BOSS because it not being wireless is the only thing that makes me look at other mice in the market.",
          "This is the perfect shape; great for shooters. Regular mice shape just feel wrong to me now (too narrow), and I've only used this for 1 day. I even just bought a second one as backup.",
          "Not going to blather on about specs and all that nonsense, just gonna say...This mouse is amazing. (at first..)I have been on a mice collecting spree for awhile now and I just snagged this sucker up even though I told myself I was done buying wired mice.The praise for its shape was just too good to pass up and I figured it was different enough to justify adding it to my collection.Lemme' tell ya' this thing is as comfortable as has been said by many reviewers.-The light weight makes it so snappy, yet the grip allows for so much control.- I would also like to point out the stock cord that comes with it is great. It is basically like having a shoestring on the mouse and it is very unnoticeable (Very nice to see as a standard cable, more mouse-makers need to take note)-The clicks are all snappy and responsive, with nice comfort groves for your fingers to rest. They are a little weak sounding but we want function over sound and that's what you get here.My only major complaint (aside from there not being a wireless version) is the side buttons are a little small. Not as bad as the Razer Viper Ultimate and they do protrude a bit more, but they could have been better. (Check out the side buttons on the Roccat Burst COOLER MASTER. Those are proper side buttons!)Anyways... If the shape interests you, don't hesitate, treat your hands to this wonderful mouse it is worthy of being your go-to fragging tool.Edit: After using this mouse for only a few weeks the M1+2 clicks develop a noticeable squeak/creak due to the weak plastic used for the switch covers which also have a lot of flex. There is no wobble or Post-pretravel and the clicks are still responsive, but the material is without a doubt very weak/cheap.I ended up getting myself a Hyper X Pulsefire Haste which is also a Lightweight-Honeycomb design, it weighs 59g (10 more than this, still lightweight enough) and costing only $50 as well and I gotta say... The Pulsefire Haste destroys the MM720 when it comes to build/material quality for the pricepoint. The M1+2 clicks are so much more satisfying and actually made strong with 0 flex. HyperX did not cheap out on the clicks like CoolerMaster did.Now this may seem like I'm trying to sell you on a Hyper X Pulsefire Haste instead of the MM720, but I'm not...(Though you should try out the Haste, Best $50 out of the box mouse on the market... Just sayin')....because the CoolerMasterMM720 is a very unique mouse shape and I love it and am sure you will too if you are interested in the shape, but I definitely feel Cooler Master could take a page out of HyperX's playbook when it comes to actually building a proper endgame mouse that does not sacrifice in build quality just to be lightweight.I very much hope CoolerMaster will make a V2 of the MM720 that sees refinements to the overall build.Until then, this mouse is not actually meeting its full potential and it is a shame because the shape is truly great.Seriously, CoolerMaster if you ever read this.The MM720 could easily be the perfect endgame mouse for many if you guys would dump some major love into it. I'm talking Final Mouse 'Mouse of the Gods' level of love.-Make it wireless-Same weight range 47-55g-Magnesium Alloy structureI would gladly pay $150-$200 for this mouse.",
          "I absolutely love this mouse! It feels so good to hold. Once I used this mouse it feels uncomfortable to use any other mouse. I like the rgb and the software that allows you to customize a lot of stuff. I've had this mouse for about 2 years now and just now it has broken. The scroll wheel broke but that was mostly my fault. The quality feels kinda cheap but I still love this mouse.",
          "It is a reliable mouse. Yes you can turn off the led light on it.Prefer this to a wireless mouse, and no charging!!!!",
          "I have been searching for the perfect mouse since I first joined the PCMR, the shape of my hands are a bit unusual as I have large palms with short fat fingers. It says this is a claw style mouse but since my hands are different it works perfectly as a palm grip mouse. I bought both the matte and glossy white one's and plan on getting both black versions too. I understand why they made it a wired mouse, but I swear if Cooler Master made a wireless version of this mouse I would buy 20 of them so I would never need to worry about buying a new mouse EVER AGAIN lol. Cooler Master PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GABEN, make a wireless version, we gamers will understand that it will be slightly heavier and we are ok with it.",
          "I've owned the G Pro Wireless for the past 2 years. I've loved it but decided to try out a lighter mouse. I decided to purchase the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 Cape Town. After that purchase and looking at a ton of mice, I decided to also purchase the MM720 because it was cheap, a different shape that I either like or hate, and lightweight. Worst case, I was out $50 from this. Turns out, worst case is I'm out $100 from the purchase of the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 Cape Town.Pros:- THE SHAPE!!! I can finally rest my ring finger and pinky. This is what's currently selling me on this mouse- The weight - this coupled with the shape is really nice- The glide - the feet on this are very smooth, no complaints about the original feet- The cable - don't know if this is a big deal on other mice, but the cable is very lightweight and flexible- The side buttons - they have a hump in the middle of each side button, and so far I think I like it. I do wish the side buttons were longer, but I'm at least glad it's very easy to press the correct side button- The cost - obviously after purchasing the GPW and Finalmouse, I don't care about cost that much, but it's definitely a bonus about this mouseCons:- The quality - it feels like it's make of cheap plastic. Easily the worst quality of any mouse I've used. If this were improved on the mouse while keeping it lightweight, I'd be willing to spend A LOT more on this- The clicks - I know a lot of people have had squeak issues, and so far I haven't had any. I'm still giving it  a negative because that's a known issue for many, and honestly, the clicks don't feel any special. The clicks work well for me because of the grip I get on the mouse, but the clicks feel on the low quality side- Side buttons - I don't have enough use yet, but it seems like you have to click them in harder than the other mice- The scroll wheel - could be a negative or positive depending on how you like your scroll wheel. It's not super smooth, you're going to feel each turn. The quality of the scroll wheel feels nice, but kinda like the side buttons, you need a bit more effort to use it compared to the other miceIn addition: I took this mouse, the GPW, and Finalmouse to Aim Lab (Gridshot) and performed a fair bit better on the MM720 solely because it felt so much more comfortable in my hands. I was able to get a score of 78,000 with the MM720, and 70,000 with both the GPW and Finalmouse with multiple tries. The glide was super smooth and everything just felt right in MY HANDS. I have smaller hands and prefer a palm grip, so this turned out to be the mouse for me. If you have bigger hands you might not like it because there isn't anywhere to rest your palm. If they extended it in the back a bit, it could fit more people's hands. If you don't like the palm grip you might still like it, I'm not sure. Personally, I hope more mice can be made in this shape in the future with better build quality. I'm fairly confident that this will be my mouse for the foreseeable future.",
          "The MM720 reminds me of the xornet that I grew up on. I loved that mouse. There are few mice as ergonomic as this one, and the weight of this mouse is less than essentially all of its competition. The mouse sports a sensor that is more than enough for essentially anyone. The price is phenomenal.There is one thing. That dreaded squeak. I couldn't really hear it past my headphones, but it happens, and it shouldn't. The mouse performs great, its just loud as a result, but this can be fixed. DO NOT SPRAY WD-40 INTO IT. WD-40 is far too harsh on the plastics, even if it is non-conductive. WD-40 will work for a day, then kill the mouse button (Lets say I have prior experience). If you want to fix this issue use something like a silicone lube I would assume, but make sure not to use something harsh on plastic. WD-40 is a penetrating oil after all, not a lubricant.",
          "\u00a0I like it so much, very comfortable gripping for gamings and Autocad. I will recommend this product.",
          "Saw this and just had to try it. Might take some getting used to. I've been using a Fnatic Clutch 2. It's a much larger mouse. This mm720 is more claw/finger grip than it is palm grip...at least with my hands. Very lightweight. Left mouse button feels a bit heavy. I have \"heavy\" fingers. When I click the left mouse button,  it's like I have to make extra effort to release it or else it gets \"stuck\" down by the weight of my finger.",
          "Relaxed claw gripSwitches need to be updated to latest version found in other miceGrip tape is slippery, no grip",
          "Purchased this to complement several other gaming mice I owned from some big names (Alienware, Logitech, Mad Catz Ratt, Razer, Thermaltake TT, HyperX, Corsair, and Asus.  This was the second lowest price mouse I bought for gaming and it is the only one I use now.  I play with a claw grip and it has the right width to accommodate for this.  It is super light and very responsive.  The plastic used by CoolerMaster feels grippy and I can always maintain control.  I have other mice that are 4x more expensive and they are slippery where I have to continually readjust my hand and finger placement because they slide during intense gaming action.  Best value for the money!  It was so good, I bought a second one in case CoolerMaster stops production someday.",
          "For those that don't remember, this is a remake of the Spawn mouse (they had one more like this but I forget the name) But both were discontinued and were replaced with the poorly named \"master mouse\" and those of us coming from the Spawn quit buying CM mice (those that I know at least) but when I saw this iconic shape I knew I had to give it a try again......And SO GLAD I did !  This is a wonderful mouse and the has been improved as well. The mouse not only comes with an improved braid over the cable (this one feels more like a sheath than part of the cable like most do) and that in turn keeps the cable from getting bound up and in the way. Also not only do they give you extra set of feet, but also in the package is grips for the sides and buttons. While a cool addition I did not feel the need since the mouse is so damn light. All in all this is the mouse I have been waiting for ever since the Spawn was discontinued. Cheers CM !",
          "Amazing shape and basically weightless. I can't see myself ever using another mouse for gaming.Issues I found:- Slight creaking when using right click (started about a month in).- White gets dirty where your finger tips lie.- Not all dpis are available (can't set it to 450, only 400 or 500).That being said, very satisfied. Next time I'll just get the black one instead.Update: I ended up trashing my white MM720. Switches started feeling cruddy after months of use. I decided to pick up the mouse again and ordered in Matte black this time.The reason I did was because I found Razer v2 opticals switches in another marketplace. Once I swapped the stock LK optical switches with the Razer V2s, the mouse improved exponentially.With the black version I received there is no creaking like my previous glossy white one. Still wish the side buttons were more flush with the mouse, but the new switches have made this mouse my all day use for gaming and work.Hopefully CM releases a wireless version with new side button design but until then I'm very happy with the MM720 now.",
          "Pros:-Light-VERY comfortable to hold-3389 sensor-optical switches-for the price you pay, you get more top tier features than a lot of mice selling at twice that priceCons:-this is just my experience, but this mouse is very wide making horizontal movement challenging-I prefer to use this mouse more for browsing and casual gaming, I do not play well in FPS games due to my casual claw grip style",
          "This is easily one of the best mice I've ever used and I'm a bit of a collector, I've used basically all the top gaming mice. I was really surprised how good it is, it completely exceeded my expectations. Out of all the mice I have, I just keep coming back to this brilliant mouse.-The ergos are incredible for fingertip grip or a hybrid fingertip-palm grip, it just fits perfectly in your fingers. The little ring finger support is perfect and one of the most unique features you can't really find anywhere else, I reeeeally wish more mice would implement this feature, so few of them do, it allows you to use all your fingers to control vs. your pinky and ring finger not really making good connection with the body of the mouse and your pinky just kind of hanging out in the air or on the mousepad. The shape might not be for everybody, but if you haven't tried it yet you have to, it's great, I feel super confident using it.-The weight is the lightest I've ever used at only 50 grams it feels incredible and glides so easily and smoothly. The only mouse that I've tried that is this lightweight is the cooler master mm730. In my experience using lots of different mice, I find that generally, the lighter the mouse the better the feel and this one takes the #1 prize in that category (unless you buy something extreme and expensive like Zaunkoenig M2K at 24 grams)-The Cord is really good, very flexible, much better than the Razer mice, but not quite as good as the Glorious cables (which are the best) but close.-The build quality feels great so far, no creaking or flexing or anything, nice clicks-Scroll wheel could be better, depending on the copy you get it can be perfect, the 1st one I got has one part where it makes a little click due to the design of the spring, not a deal breaker at all, but I got a 2nd one and it was totally perfectAll I can say is I hope cooler master never stops making this gem, and more mice are made like this in general, it is currently my favorite mouse and probably will be for years unless somebody produces something that can match it.Not to mention the price is fantastic, I paid like $30, there are a lot of mice out there that are inferior in many categories that cost 2-3x as much. In fact the new deathadder v3 pro is like $150 which is insane, it's literally 5x what this insanely good mouse cost. You could literally get 5 of these for the price of 1 of those, and is that mouse 5x better? No. Even though it looks like a really nice mouse, I'd honestly be surprised if it was even 1x as good as this mouse, forget 5x.So this mouse is a no-brainer, get it.",
          "The Grip:First of all, when Cooler Master claims this is the king of the Claw Grip mouse grip, they're lying to you. Not sure what they were thinking, if anything it's a 'decent' Fingertip mouse, but unless you have tiny hands (and I mean TINY) you cannot claw grip this mouse comfortably. I have small hands, and my hands are too big for this mouse, and I'm a claw grip person. I'd like to be able to place the tip of my pointer finger at the back end of the scroll wheel in order to quickly \"flick\" the scroll wheel to change weapons in a game, however the flat part of my pointer finger rests 3/4 of the way up the scroll wheel, making it incredibly inconsistent for me to scroll quickly. Sometimes I miss my scrolls completely and end up dying because I can't switch weapons. I also find myself always wanting to right click (M2) with my ring finger because of the fat resting spot for your ring finger, and it take some getting used to (about 30m) to train myself to not do that. Then with claw grip, your palm kind of rests on the far back of the mouse a little, but with this mouse, it can't rest on it at all, forcing you into a fingertip grip. And palm grip is just physically impossible on this thing.The Materials:The mouse I purchased was Matte Black. I own an MM710, and I love it, also in Matte Black. The matte material they use with this mouse is different than the MM710, and the new material is so much worse. Your hands get stuck on the mouse, making it incredibly uncomfortable to move your ring finger for any reason, and your thumb gets stuck on the side when you're trying to hit your side buttons. Makes me wish I had gotten the glossy version, I probably would have liked it more.The Side Buttons:I can't explain why it's like this, but the M4 button is nicely extruded from the mouse, allowing for easy pressing of the mouse--whether you roll your thumb up to it, or lift it to press it--, but M5 is so far up the mouse and it feels like it's embedded further into the mouse, making it really hard to press. It almost feels like M5 is part of the frame of the mouse, whereas M4 is an actual button. I would have liked to see M5 where M4 is, and M4 further back on the mouse.Scroll Wheel:The scroll wheel has the smallest stops in the world, it's pitiful. You can VERY easily slide right past your weapons because of how poor the stops are. Note: This is with putting my finger in the comfortable position to scroll, which isn't natural when gripping the mouse. This also means when you go to try and push M3, you instead scroll because the stops don't do a good enough job at preventing you from NOT scrolling.Software/RGB:Not a selling point for me, but the RGB on this mouse is terrible. The vibrancy of the colors is minimal. You choose a pink and it comes out dull, practically white, and you pick a purple and it comes out pink. All standard colors are the same way. I used the same color code for my MM720 as I did my SK630, and the vibrancy difference is night and day.Positives?:Compared to my MM710, I do appreciate them decreasing the size of the holes so your fingers don't get stuck in them while playing. I do personally like that feature of the MM710 because I can place my pinkie finger in one of the holes to keep it off my mouse pad to reduce friction, but I know a lot of people don't like those holes.It's extremely light weight, even less than my MM710, which I can definitely appreciate, even if the difference is negligible.The cable is the same as the MM710, which I still think is the best cable in the business. It's like attaching a shoe lace to your mouse, it never kinks, never tangles, and it's as light as a feather.That's about it honestly. I do not recommend this mouse to anybody, but if you're willing to give it a try, be my guest. It's only suitable in my opinion for Claw Grip individuals with REALLY small hands, or small handed Fingertip individuals. Palm users, go find something else.",
          "The mouse just feels great in the hand.  Its super lightweight.  It glides across my mousepad.  The different lighting setups are all bright and awesome.I'm excited to have found a good, claw grip mouse.  Im hoping the style and weight will help ease some of my hand fatigue.",
          "***The Razer Viper is the mouse on the left in the pictures, for a size comparison with a standard sized mouse***Shape: Perfect for me with a wider shape and ring finger support. The shorter length isn't a problem since I can control it really well in the areas that my fingers touch. The holes don't bother me with how they designed it. It has liquid protection on the inside which is a nice peace of mind (although what ogre puts liquids near their peripherals to spill? NEANDERTHALS I SAY!).Weight: Crazy low at 49 grams. This super light weight also makes the shorter length not a problem, because it doesn't take much energy to move this mouse, even with a finger tip grip.Sensor: As good as any other top notch sensor. It tracks just as well as the G Pro wireless hero sensor.Main button clicks: Articulate and snappy. The latency is as responsive as my razer optical switches, and they're labeled as optical switches on the box.Side button clicks: The two buttons are a shallow mustache shape, and this is really nice to feel the buttons separately. They don't have a big travel time, and the click is nice.Scroll wheel: defined enough that I don't misclick when switching weapons fast. That's about all I need from a scroll wheel.Mouse feet: PTFE mouse feet which are smooth and durable, just like an anime waifu \ud83d\ude0d.Cable: Ultra weave para cord. A little more flexible than my razer viper's para cord, which is impressive.RGB: The full color spectrum with a few lighting patterns. For a $50 mouse, the RGB from the inside of the honeycomb is very well done. The breathing pattern has a very smooth gradient, from fully lit to all the way off. I underestimated how cool a honeycomb design would be for RBG. This is *especially* cool to have full RGB with such a ridiculously low weight (lighter than the Logitech superlight, yet it still has RGB).Final Thoughts: For this mouse to be $50, it's kind of unreal. It's only 49 grams, it has a really ergonomic shape, and it has every other feature you would demand from an e-sports mouse. As long as the shape works for someone, and they are cool with a wired mouse, I think this mouse is a 10/10.",
          "I've been a PC gamer for almost 18 years now, and my wrists and fingers are starting to feel the wear! I decided to try a lightweight mouse to help with wrist and finger pain moving it around.First I was a little worried this would be too small for my banana hands (I'm 6'4 and have been able to palm a basketball since I was 14 lol) but it's perfect combination of size and weight makes it almost seem like I'm using a trackpad it's so light! I LOVE the 3rd finger rest which makes small precise movements a little easier at high dpi imoMy ONLY drawback is the quality of the switches. The clicking feels cheap and the side buttons feel like membrane garbage.In summary, they have the shape and weight NAILED, just needs some better quality switches and maybe a wireless variant!",
          "I\u2019ve been using two versions of this mouse (one for work & one for gaming/personal computer) since late 2020. Im a pretty small person and have had to use cheap laptop mice for most of my life because of my hand size and that I prefer a claw grip. I\u2019ve tried a couple other \u201cgaming\u201d mice before this, but they\u2019ve all been too large for my hand and I can never reach any of the extra buttons without moving my entire hand. These mice have been a total lifesaver - way more comfortable than the portable laptop mice I had been using, allows my hands to spread out a bit, and are still lightweight enough to be comfortable.I bought a matte and glossy version (black and white respectively) and I prefer the matte version for long sessions. The white glossy has been super easy to clean though. I haven\u2019t spent much time in the settings aside from setting up LED lights honestly, but I\u2019ve been able to configure them on my windows machine and carry it over to my mac for work and the colors/settings stay. I\u2019ll continue buying this mouse if I need til they\u2019re no longer made.",
          "Used to always buy heavy big mouses because my hands are huge - but i noticed i still cant palm grip the entire mouse, they are always too small (even the biggest one). so instead i decided to roll 180* and buy a very light mouse for my 2 fingers claw grip and boy of boy im never going back!i dont care for the high DPI etc, i use it on 800 anyways, sensor is absolutely fine and a very cheap price for such weight. will definitely buy again if it breaks.",
          "Excellent, lightweight, responsive, ergonomic mouse, especially for palm-grippers like myself. Good sensor, good cable, RGB if you're into that sort of thing, super-lightweight honeycomb shell. It's perfect......until you have to interact with MasterPlus, CoolerMaster's absolutely mindless implemenation of the already awful trend of mandatory software that sits in your tray all day doing who-knows-what. At best, the offerings from Razer, Logitech, etc. in this department are competent enough to stay out of the way until you \"need\" them, but MasterPlus... let me count the ways it disappoints.First, it doesn't update itself. Whenever it needs an update, which seems to be weekly, it just... stops working. Which means your mouse sensitivity, lighting, game profiles, everything they make you set up in this awful software is disabled until you update the software manually. There's also no prompt to do so, the only way you know your MasterPlus is out of date is when the mouse goes dark and resets to 800 DPI in the middle of whatever you're doing.Oh, did I mention installing this update actually reinstalls the whole software suite every time? Which means there's no point in setting up profiles or anything more complicated than 30 seconds of fiddling in the tool will allow, because it does a full reinstall of the suite and, although it asks if you'd like to keep your \"old\" settings a profiles, still just blows them all away when it starts anew?I have no idea how there can be such a huge gulf between the hardware and software arms of this company, but this insane software is the only thing that stops me from recommending this mouse to others and, furthermore, buying a few backups for myself.If you're looking for the return of the G9X, this is it, but hold out until someone else remakes it or CoolerMaster fixes this tool.",
          "The mouse is extremely comfortable to use and has been functioning well for the 3 or so months I had it. Only has like two things that I don't like that kind of keep me from rating it 5 stars, but I would recommend nonetheless. Would recommend to those that play games or don't, it's overall very pleasant and comfortable.The coating on the mouse feels a little odd (kinda chalky) and gets greasy and gross way too easily. I don't have particularly greasy hands, so it's definitely a issue with the coating but it's easy to clean with a Clorox wipe. I probably should have gotten the glossy version, it would have felt a lot more comfortable and I recommend others to get that one too.The software while great is not as customizable as I would like. Specifically the mouse has a layer shift function that allows you to basically transform some of the buttons to have different functions. The issue with this feature is that it's awkward to use while playing games, it requires you to press down the scroll wheel and you can't bind it to a different button. If I was able to bind the layer shift to a different button like the back button it would have been a excellent mouse. The mouse does save everything on board though so you can use it without needing to constantly have the software for it running in the background.",
          "This is my favorite mouse I've ever used. Super lightweight, shape fits like a glove (very underrated IMO) and my aim in FPS feels sharp as ever. Cable is also one of the best stock I've ever used and makes it feel wireless without the added latency.Now the problem is Cooler Master's quality control is notoriously pretty bad. I've went through many CM mice and they either had a creaky shell or developed mushy buttons in less than 6 months of use. I only got lucky with one glossy MM720. CM has you covered for a replacement but don't be surprised if it still has the same problems as the one you sent back.If you win the lottery and get a unit from a good batch, this is easily in the Top 3 of gaming mice as long as the shape works for you.Good luck.",
          "Superb!!Fits like a glove! Shockingly light. Seriously, super frigging light. It replaced a death adder elite which feels like a freaking dinosaur next to this mouse.Perfect for claw grip. I mainly play FPS games and it's almost a 1 to 1 connection to your hand. Feels like an extension of you. Seriously.It's rgb and nice snowy white. Not a huge fan of glossy, but it doesn't impact grip. I was expecting to add the side tape as I thought I would need it for extra grip but nope. Even though it's glossy, it's not slippery and light enough to never ever lose your grip. Even while shooting and trying to maintain the recoil down while shifting towards head shots.My hand really isn't that large or wide. So it's really perfect for anyone tbh.The only con of this mouse is the glossy material picks up gamer gunk, but this mouse is soooooo dam good that I wouldn't knock a star because of it.With the razer death adder elite I played @800 dpi but with this mouse I was able to go down to 600 dpi because it's so damn light. At Warzone I averaged around 16 ish kills per game but now I'm up to a 19-20 ish kills per game. Awesome!!!I never thought Cooler Master would actually make a high end pro mouse but they did..."

          "10 years ago, I wanted a durable mouse that wouldn't stop working after 2-3 years (that popular office  brand \"L\" was no good), so I bought the Xornet Cooler Master - and I still use it. At the time I bought this, I thought my Xornet had stopped working properly. It turned out it still works. Now I wanted to receive this product and keep it. But I remember looking at the product photo many times and wondering about...dirt.Yes, dirt. That thing that ends up inside your keyboard, and between the cracks of your mouse, and whatever item you have with cracks/holes/crevices where dirt could sneak into.Just looking at this product made me assume that dirt would easily end up in the mouse, and it would be difficult to clean it. Am I wrong? Maybe others that have actually used it for a while have an opinion on this. Anyway. I changed my mind about the mouse and initiated a return before I could even receive it.It looks pretty cool with the honeycomb design (unless you have trypophobia), but I figured having to clean it would be a real pain. I like keeping my things clean, as much as possible.",
          "I dont know what some of these youtubers and reviewers are talking about. I have been using this mouse for over 3 months( Hardcore Gaming and Work). Over 4-6 hours per day, 6-7 days per week. No problems whatsoever. Now this thing is the lightest mouse I have ever played with, and I have used them all.  GET THIS MOUSE. I GOT ON SALE, AND THEIR ISNT ANYTHING OUT THERE THAT CAN BEAT IT. HANDS DOWN. I HAVE USED THEM ALL, GLORIOUS O, LOGITECH, RAZER, ETC.1. There is not movement for the sidewall or the Clickers2. No problems with the buttons(side)3. No problems with the braided cord.",
          "It feels light and the rbg are amazing too, but the gliding of this mouse is amazing.",
          "My mouse came, was excited got it out of the box and used it for a bit, the left and right click buttons had play in them left and right and didn't stay stable while clicking, it might have been a bad model but I expected more from my first cooler master mouse? Go with G wolves or a logitech mouse it'll be worth it. I am NOT a picky person when it comes to mice but this didn't meet my expectations one bit.",

          "Mouse is light, smooth and precise. Lighting is nice but not annoying. Cord is the best mouse cord I have ever used, so soft and flexible. Anti-friction feet slide across surfaces silently. I got the green",
          "This mouse seems to be the best right now for me, and I\u2019ve tried a lot.You guys should make another model exactly like this but as an egg shape. All you would need to do is remove the outward flare of mouse 1 and 2 and make it curve inward. You could call it the mm7e or mm712. That mouse would sell extremely well because: you already have a good reputation of making good claw mice because of the mm720. And also because egg shape mice are very rare for some reason and most of the models are a few years old.",
          "Anyway happily paid only thwenty of the green things for a glossy black one instead of the other colors that cost 2.5x more.  Great lightweight simple gaming mouse.  Had some issues getting the rez  worked out in games but that was fixed with the CM software.  Windows isnt enough in this case.",
          "Nice mouse.-Cool green color that works as an accent piece in my setup.-Good performance.-Very light, as advertised. No more wrist pain!",
          "I initially bought one several years ago and its held up incredibly, this is by far the best mouse you can get for the price. When I had to get a new mouse for my 2nd pc it was a no brainer",
          "love playing games with this",
          "I prefer the m711 so this works. Different color than my black one so that's cool.",
          "It's just a fine mouse, honestly. Plugged the bad boy in a few minutes ago and the top notes I have are that it is very \"clicky\" & the mouse sensitivity is rubbish. The mouse clicks are fairly loud and noticeable. The sensitivity scale is also pretty rough; it goes from very slow to hyperspeed and you have to click through every speed and loop back around to the first. Makes me really miss my CM Storm XORNET's sensitivity scale. The mouse is also incredibly lightweight, which may be a turnoff for others like myself. Will I be returning it? Probably not, I think I'll get used to the loudness of the mouse clicks and the sensitivity.",
          "It is very light",
          "First off the QC on my unit is great - no issues.I love the shape of this mouse for claw - it's a smaller mouse in length but doesn't feel all that small which is great. I love the looks of the wilderness edition being a big fan of colors exactly like this. This mouse is also just a amazing value as you're getting a high end mouse with a high end sensor all for not much. Easy recommendation!",
          "Great mouse. It\u2019s small and compact, which fits my hands perfectly. Cooler master definitely fixed all the issues they had with this mouse and right now it\u2019s working great for me. This mouse is suitable for most popular games due to its 1000hz polling rate and 3389 sensor.",
          "My son love this for his gaming set up.",
          "got this to replace my razor mamba elite, i really like this light mouse and my gaming has imrpoved. didnt know how heavy my last mouse was  till i got this one. at first i didnt like the RGB and i think its nice. the switches are nice and it makes a nice clicking sound. when this one goes i might just get another in white.update: the mouse started to creek and the mouse buttons makes an annoying sound when pressed. taking off 1 star. its still amazing for the sales price that i paid.",
          "super light mouse which is good for flicking and making cleaner hand movements. Color looks good and rgb is cool. obviously it is a plastic mouse for lightweight use but material still holds up well",
          "Maybe it's only mine, but there is a high pitch constant buzz sound that it makes. It's just loud enough to be irritating when I don't have headphones on. Otherwise, I really like the light weight and tracking of this mouse.",
          "Definitely light weight. Awesome color variety for RGB. Wife hates the honeycombs design. Which is hilarious.",
          "Got a semi-bad batch, would\u2019ve gave it 5 stars if scroll wheel didn\u2019t give out after 2-3 months daily usage. You could say I am somewhat of a hardcore gamer nerd though. Great mouse for the price point.",
          "Mice are very subjective, but I love this mouse. It's my go-to for gaming. It fills my palm perfectly and allows to play with a subtle claw style, which I prefer. The RGB is just right and I like how the mouse wheel has dedicated colors when you change DPI. My only complaint with that is I can't change those color options in the software. Also, the software is great. Even better than Logitech's G-Hub. It's simple, easy to use, and straight to the point.The bad: This could just be my mouse, but it barely works without the software open. If I plug this into my laptop which doesn't have the software, it's unusable. It worked on my PC when I first plugged it in (obviously I was able to navigate the web to download the software), but it got quirky after that.",
          "light and holds up well",
          "As a fingertip gripper I immediately fell in love with this thing, a massive step up from my oversized G502. The mouse is light, glides easily, and nearly fits my hand perfectly. I say nearly because I feel like the second shoulder button is still a little bit farther away from my thumb than I would like. Otherwise it's a fantastic mouse for a fingertip grip user and it's not very expensive.However, I've had nothing but trouble with the profile software. At first I couldn't even download it because Cooler Master had apparently exceeded their bandwidth usage for that month! Now that I have the software I find it won't save any changes to my profiles and I can't adjust the lighting at all beyond static lights. Furthermore, it tells me that there's a firmware update available for the mouse, but when I try to download it the status updates with a big red X, which tells me absolutely nothing about what went wrong or how to fix it and so far my mouse's firmware remains updated.Bottom line, fantastic mouse, but the software creates a major problem because I can't fine tune it to my specifications.",
          "Bought this Cooler master MM710 for my son & the scroller never worked",
          "The hump this mouse is nice and fits in your palm. The side buttons are clicky and in a good position. Weight of the mouse is good. It isn't too wide either. Buttons are good but mine wobble, not a deal breaker but overall amazing for claw grip.",
          "Feels cheap, it's on the smaller side, great for children. The weight is amazing, just wish it was a hair bigger, might go with a Model-D Glorious mouse if I can't get the Final Mouse 2 at MSRP.",
          "As others have pointed out, my package came with obvious signs that the box was opened from the bottom in order to avoid breaking the seals at the top of the packaging. Probably a used mouse which is the norm for Amazon. The picture I took of the box is BEFORE I opened it. I ordered the blue steel version and it looks very different from the stock photos, even with my camera's flash.Decent mouse for the price ($25). I urge anyone that can solder to put some higher quality switches on this mouse. I had some extra Kailh 8s on hand and it made a world of difference. Good build quality and good ergos. Stock feet are fine, better than most. Stock cable is fine as well, but I'll be installing an aftermarket one soon. It's a little too thick for my liking. Grips are a must for this mouse as it is slick and can get away from you. ABS plastic shell is guaranteed to have oil stains after a month or 2 so buyer beware. I give this mouse a 3.0/5.",
          "Opened the package and was disappointed at how smol this mouse was",
          "It\u2019s 53 grams and 27 bucks. Need I say more? Bad boy has me hitting headshots more than any mouse I\u2019ve ever used.",

          "It\u2019s a good mouse I recommend it to everyone it\u2019s not heavy and it feels like a wireless gaming mouse I recommend this product to everyone that is trying competitive gaming",
          "\u00a0Very nice mouse. It\u2019s pretty much the same size as a viper mini. Very flexible cable. I changed out the switches to Kailh gm 4.0 on main clicks. Now, It\u2019s Awesome! It\u2019s a lil small for me at 19.5 cm long hands but still manageable with a claw/ fingertip style.",

          "My son asked for this for Christmas. I was surprised because I know good gaming mouses tend to be stupid expensive, but I'm smart enough not to ask further questions. It's 2 months later and he was still bragging about it to his friends, apparently it's \"dope\". Ok teenager.  I accept. Fyi I am not a great mom and he games CONSTANTLY so I trust his assessment.",
          "I have really small hands about below the average adult hand size and using this was the biggest game change to how I do things on the computer whether for gaming, business enterprises, or just plain surfing the internet.No longer do I have to put so much effort into holding onto a mouse and dragging it around while wearing me down physically but rather swiftly swiping back and effort with incredible ease, even while gaming. Exactly what I need to get things done with minimal effort. And hey.. maybe I'm decreasing the chance I get carpal tunnel as opposed to other big mouses out there.Perfect for my hand size.Hand Circumference : 7\"Thumb To Pinky Width : 7.5\"Hand Length : 6.75\"Hand Size Avgr : 7.08\"",
          "The average adult mouse is about 30g. This mouse is about 50g. I'm sure a mouse would notice that extra 20g if you put it on their back, but I am pretty sure you wouldn't notice the difference holding it in your hand. Using it is like taking the mouse out of the equation, plugging you directly into the computer. Ok maybe it's not that matrixy, but it's very comfortable to use and I'd highly recommend it. Especially versus a wireless mouse, because again, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't notice the difference.",

          "The MM710 is similar in shape to my favorite mouse, the Zowie ZA13. The cable is extremely flexible, the buttons and scroll wheel feel good, and it's the lightest mouse I've ever held. It also has a gaming grade optical sensor.It won't be replacing the ZA13 as a daily driver, but I wanted something that I could set and store macros on for certain games and applications. This mouse fits the bill perfectly. I found the Masterplus software extremely easy to use and love that I can store the settings right on the mouse.It doesn't have the quality feel of a Zowie mouse, but it feels solid enough for the price point it is currently selling at. I really like that there are glossy options too. I had to modify the scroll wheel on the Zowie to make it decent for scrolling in applications or browsing the internet, which wasn't hard to do. I'd say that had I not modified the scroll wheel, I'd prefer the MM710 over the Zowie.For reference, previous favorite mice include Logitech G303, G Pro, and G9X back in the day.Very happy with my purchase and feel it's an unbeatable value for under $35.",
          "I prefer wireless mice but my series x has been having issues intermittently losing connection in the midst of battle.I've never owned a light weight gaming mouse as I tend to get shakey in the heat of the moment, think I went the wrong way with it as I have soo much more control over this mouse than I did with any of my heavier mice.That being said my g9x can finally be put to rest in the nearby landfill as it was cheaper to buy this than repair it.This mouse has the feel of a logitech but the thumb buttons are a million times better, every logitech mouse I've used I tend to hit the thumb button when in a heated fight, with this mouse I have yet to do that and I have about 12hrs on it.. nothing is worse than nearly killing someone just to die because you knifed instead of continuing to fire at your target.My accuracy is at least 50% better and continuing to get better as I get used to the mouse.",

          "Let me first say,I have used several top of the line mice, from the G Pro Wireless, Razer Ultimate Wireless, G Wolves Hati to the Model O/O- and the Logitech G305. And this has by far been a very comfortable shape to use. I myself have a hybrid claw/fingertip grip where I have my upper palm rest on the mouse. This is perfect!My only complaint is that the stock mouse feet used are atrocious! At times I felt that they were scratching my mouse pad. I use a SteelSeries mousepad Qck and felt at times that it was damaging the surface. It was to the point where I felt concerned about using this mouse further until eventually, I decided to use an extra pair of hyper-glides I had for the g305. After replacing the mouse feet I felt this mouse was my meant for me and my play-style. There are no replacement hyper glides for this type of mouse but I feel as though there might be in the future. If you spend the extra money to invest in hyper glides to replace the stock feet, I feel that this is the perfect mouse. I have included the setup I used in the photos.With this mouse, I felt I was able to hit various flick shots, in every type of FPS game. I feel that this is a mouse that every gamer should at least try. This, for now, has been my main mouse and it has carried me through Destiny 2 comp with no hassle. I highly recommend!",
          "UPDATE: just under 6mo of ownership and the right click intermittently becomes unresponsive. For gaming it's very problematic. If you're playing a game where you need to quick scope and it doesn't register the click it makes it very unenjoyable and difficult. It doesn't do it in back to back clicks but it does happen unexpectedly even though you can hear the click so you know mechanically it's pressed. Still a fantastic mouse but I have to drop a star because I have never had a mouse die this quick. Also, I'm 6ft with probably average sized hands for my height and the mouse is a bit small. I have melee set to the most forward thumb button and I find myself accidentally pressing it despite my best effort to reposition my hand. I am going to order a Glorious mouse in the larger size and hope that's the end of my mouse purchases for a while.This is seriously the best mouse I have ever used. I wanted a FinalMouse but it's always out of stock or resold for insane prices. So I bought this Cooler Master mouse as an alternative to the FinalMouse and have to say I can't imagine going back to my junky g403. I see a lot of love for the g403 on Reddit and other places but the new ghub software for Logitech products is horrible and doesn't see my Logitech devices half the time so once that mouse stopped working (left click became inconsistent while held down) I knew it was my chance to get away from that GHub software. I'm so glad I gave this one a chance. I play competitive first person shooters like Overwatch, CSGO, Valorant, and COD. I have been making my adjustment to this mouse as it's a little smaller than the g403 and feels lighter because of both the mouse weight and the cord weight.I can't stress how significant of a difference it is to have a lightweight super flexible cord on a mouse. It's literally like having yarn as your cord. My g403 cord always got in the way and felt stiff so there was always this friction present when moving the mouse. But now it legit feels like I am using a wireless mouse.If you want a super lightweight and COMFORTABLE mouse and if you can't stand feeling the weight of a wired mouse cable being pulled around and don't want to spend a ton of money then this is the mouse.I still plan on buying a FinalMouse one day but not because this one isn't sufficient. Purely because it's said to be the absolute best in the industry. But if you're stuck and FinalMouse is out of stock give this one a shot. I'm so happy I did!",
          "This is general build quality of the mouse and addressing some reviews i found on YT on this mouse.~ I do not have a rattle in my version of the mouse like some YT review videos show.~ I can click the side button if i press into the side shell extremely hard, this has not happened in game.~ I do not have any extreme wobble in the front left an right buttons, this appears to have been fixed by CM compared to earlier models.~ The mouse cord feels and looks like a shoe lace, extremely light weight.~ Download the software from CM's website so that you can get the firmware update and change the settings of the mouse.This is about the CM's Mouse Software used to configure the mouse.~ You can change the mouse pull rate in the CM software between 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz and 1000Hz (default).~ You can disable DPI profiles by clicking the purple box next to the profile to \"uncheck\" the profile from being active.~ Button response time can not go under 4ms, this isn't the best but I don't notice it in-game compared to my G Pro.~ The DPI range is from 200 up to 32,000 and the steps are 100 DPI. The PixArt PMW3389 sensor should be able to do 50 DPI steps but this is not currently built into the CM software so you can only do steps of 100 DPI, you will not be able to set something like 450 DPI currently.~ You can set up to 5 different profiles in the software for different games or different users on the same computer instead of using the DPI toggle switch.~ You can disconnect the X-Axis and Y-Axis and set them to different DPI levels by clicking the chin symbol between the two settings. This is probably only useful to anyone playing 4:3 stretched so that they can lower the X-Axis to actually match the Y-Axis in-game.I own several gaming mice that are on the smaller side. Logitech G Pro (wired), Logitech G303 (discontinued) and BenQ Zowie S2 and now I also own the CoolerMaster MM710 to add to my collection and I will use two of those mouse to compare the size and shape of the CM MM710 for anyone that happens to have used or own either the G Pro (wired), G305 (wireless version of the G Pro wired) or the BenQ Zowie S2.Shape wise in my opinion the CM MM710 sits right in-between the G Pro (wired) and the Zowie S2. See the attached photos for a visual reference. From Left to Right in the photos G Pro (wired), CM MM710, BenQ Zowie S2.~ The width of the MM710 is a hair wider than the G Pro (wired) and slightly narrower than the Zowie S2.~ The height of the MM710 is a hair taller than the G Pro (wired) and slightly shorter than the Zowie S2.~ The length of the MM710 is basically the same as the G Pro (wired) and shorter than the Zowie S2.~ With a little cable, the weight wise my CM MM710 comes in at 55.6g, my BenQ Zowie s2 is 84.1g and my Logitech G Pro (wired) is 85.0gPersonally, I like the shape of the CM MM710 much better than the BenQ Zowie S2 and the G Pro. It fits my hybrid grip perfectly and it only took a couple of games to adjust to the weight being lighter at the same sensitivity i normally play on. The CM MM710 has become my main mouse over the G Pro (wired).",

          "I don't usually write products reviews but there seemed to be opposing ideas and reviews on this product and after biting the bullet and ordering one regardless of negative comments (left and right click wobbling, internal sounds when shook etc) I'm here to leave my 2 cents on this mouse.Now I usually don't play FPS exclusively, therefore never really wanted/needed an FPS focused mouse such as this product. But recently I've gotten into some competitive shooters where I wanted to try something different than the Razer mmo mouse I've been using.Let me tell you this right off the bat: this mouse is SUPER lightweight. It's so much lighter than my old one and it slides incredibly well on my mousepad that I had to lower my sensetivity. It's very great for fps games as advised. I actually felt the improvement on my performance within the first day. Which makes me sad because I feel like I've been blocking myself from playing well by using my old Razer mouse.For those who are reading this to see if the other negative comments are true: my mouse doesn't have any internal rattling or wobbly clicks. Everything about the build seems solid and sturdy. Cable is also very high quality and super light weight and quite long which works with my setup.I have to say this. This mouse is a little bit small. Not a negative for me as my hands aren't big nor small. But ergonomically it took some getting used to. So if you have big hands fair warning; this mouse might be a little small for you BUT it's all to cut down from weight so if you are looking for a light mouse and have big hands, I'm not sure if there is a large light weight mouse, so you might just have to get one of these MM710's to see if you like it.",
          "I have been using it for a long time. I think it is very good. And the seller is very nice too.",
          "I loved this mouse immediately! And after a week I'm still psyched about its qualities:- Smooth and precise- Light- Chord is light and flexible and seems durable- No lights- Even the bottom has no (visible) lights (it's UV)- Just works (no config utility needed, eg to turn off lights or adjust sensitivity)- Wheel feels good (easy to turn and can feel it's positions easily)- Thumb button is easy to detect (different texture) and easy for me to press and I don't hit it by accident- Came with a spare set of skid pads- Middle click (pressing in the scroll wheel) is reasonably easy to accomplish without scrolling- Mouse speed (sensitivity) is easy to control with a physical button on the mouse (which I've never hit by accident.)- Mouse clicks sound and feel good- No ugly logo, shapes, design lines, etc- Classy/classic coloring: all black, so it matches my keyboard, speaker, monitorFIT: I have a wide palm and short fingers. The mouse fit is very good for me though I can't reach the second thumb button.I would hope the mesh-like parts of the shell would make it more pleasant to use with sweaty hands, but I haven't been sweaty enough to tell for sure.",
          "Note: I had to return my first unit because it bricked during the software update. Update it with the wireless dongle first and DO NOT touch anything until it's done updating. Amazon made replacing it a breeze, so no worries there. CMs rma would've taken weeks but amazon got me a replacement in a few days.Review: Coolermaster really upped their game with this one! If you tried the old mm710 or 11, this thing is a cut above both.A few notable changes:- the holes are gone!- it's wireless but the included cable is still usable- the coating is so much nicer than it's predecessors, fairly similar to the new viper pro or DAV3.- it's solid, no creaking, cracking, rattling and it just feels premium in the hand.- the mouse feet are WAYYYY better than the ones they used on the 710 and 711, don't need to replace them. Although, they are slightly scratchy out of the box.If you're new to this lineup, the shape may be jarring. It fills the hand similarly to the xm1 but is much narrower and shorter but the rear end is plumper if that makes sense. It's like if the viper mini got a butt lift lol. If I remember, my hands are 19x10 and I relaxed claw/fingertip this incredibly comfortably.This one's my new main and for the price, it honestly blows some of the competitors out of the water. Coolermaster really out did themselves here!",
          "The Good- Very light- Super feather light cable, not stiff. Don't even notice it is there- Good for people with small hands (probably too small for large hands though)- Pixart 3389 optical sensor, best there is.- Ability to create profiles per executable- Ability to record and create macros- Ability to assign actions to each of the 6 buttons (7th button below mouse wheel is fixed - only for DPI cycle)The Bad- DPI is controlled via button next to wheel. Has 7 default settings (400, 800, 1200, 1600, 3200, 6400, 16000)Problem with this is that you have to click 7 times to get back to the starting position.  Software should not force user to have 7 levels. If I wanted only two (say 400DPI and 800DPI), it should let me configure for only two, not 7.- There needs to be a separate dedicated mouse button to change profile. Although you can assign with one of the 7 buttons, all of them are likely going to be taken for their existing purpose.- There was no mention if there was software available to configure the mouse. None on the box, in the enclosed attachment, no URL. After visiting the Cooler Master site, there is a download section. The application name is very odd (CoolerMaster Master Plus PER Only). No idea what that is. The description is also very poor Turns out, its the MM710 configuration utility. Wasted lots of time.Update 4/24/21: Reduced to three starsThe scroll wheel is terribly flawed. Using it to scroll up or down will cause mouse wheel scroll up and down. However the hardware itself has a flaw where it will suddenly do the reverse one wheel direction resulting in a the opposite mouse wheel event to be introduced into the application reading it. For example, while playing Fortnite I have the mouse wheel used as my Use key for picking up object. Nothing pisses me off more than seeing a bunch of loot sitting in a location and then scrolling upwards only to have a down wheel even causing the last loot item to be removed from my inventory. This is not a software application bug as I've seen on Youtube videos of this hardware bug occurring.Having bought two of these mice, I am not happy with the lack of quality assurance from this product.",
          "Be wary of QC though, seems to be a known thing with these, mine arrived with the sensor PCB not properly seated in the shell, I had to open up the mouse and seat it properly.Other than that, this is a superb mouse with one of the best sensors on the market.",
          "I will be reviewing the MM711 Glossy White mouse, let me start by saying that I have been searching for the ideal mouse for over 4 years now and finally my search is over. Here are my Pros and Cons:Pros:-Perfect size for my hands (7.5\" in length from the top of my middle finger to the end of palm and 4\" in width).-Glossy finish gives the mouse a better grip in my opinion.-60g is the ideal weight for any light mouse-Software is very easy to setup-RGB is one of the best i have seen in any mice, coming from G502, G703, M65 RGB, and G903-Super cheap-The cable is so light and flexible that it makes the mouse feel wireless-The skates on this mouse is what sets it apart from any other mouse, very versatile and smooth with the addition of one of the best sensors in the market (PMW3389).CONS:-I wish the software had more profiles settings-You can only adjust you DPI in 100's-Frame seems somewhat cheap, but probably to keep the weight down.In conclusion, this is close to perfect of a mouse. It has all the qualities for competitive FPS games. This mouse is good for anyone with small to medium hands. I forgot to mention I am a fingertip mouse player, but can definitely accommodate palm grip and claw grip as well.",
          "A very decent overall mouse for a good price. As many people posting reviews here are saying, there is certainly room for improvement (as I will list below). However, I feel that if you are looking for a good gaming mouse, or even just a great overall general purpose one, you can\u2019t go wrong with the 710.Just a tip here: There are protective very thin plastic covers on the bottom pads out of the box, remove these!Pros:-Very light: Obviously this is one of the big main selling points. For years and years us gamers were told we need something heavy with removable weights. And for some this can be a benefit certainly. But after using this mouse for months now I can attest lighter is better. It feels less like you\u2019re using a \u2018tool\u2019 to move the pointer or whichever action in a game, rather more like you have almost a direct access to the action you\u2019re making on the screen by just moving your hand.-\u2018Wireless feeling\u2019 cord: It\u2019s amazing what has been pulled off here with the cord. It feels strong but at the same time so lightweight and smooth it really does feel like you\u2019re using a wireless mouse but with the added benefit of being cored (never running out of battery or latency issues).-Stylish design: Some have criticized the design and look but I personally think it looks wonderfully modern and has its own cool aesthetic without going overboard like many gaming mice out there. I also really dig the texture of the mouse, if you tend to have slightly sweatier palms this is a great one for you.-Plug and play: Theres something to be said about simpler is better. I love how you can just plug this mouse to any computer and its ready to go without requiring software to bogs down your PC when starting up.-Brand and longer warranty: Cooler Master has a good rep and the fact they gave this more than a single year warranty proves to me they have faith and stand behind what they make.Cons:-Build quality (Possible issues): Here to me is the biggest issue. Yes, the mouse does \u2018rattle\u2019 if shook, hard. But honestly, unless you\u2019re sitting at your desk idly shaking your computer mouse in your hand, that isn\u2019t a problem here. There is a slight horizontal wiggle of the primary buttons, however it\u2019s so slight I never notice it, I\u2019ve seen far worse offenders before. The clicking action feel is still rock solid.My biggest fear is the scroll wheel. After just having it for a few months it\u2019s starting to squeak lightly. It still has a great press down click and scrolling is fine, but when I head my headphones off recently and I was going through huge PDF\u2019s I noticed the noise. I hope future revisions can look into this.-Design: I have slightly above average sized hands, the main gripe I have about the size is my thumb while resting on the left size sometimes taps the forward button. I can tell they tried to mitigate this with how the forward and back buttons are shaped and the tactile feedback they give, but it still happens here and there. This is more a hand size issue than product design fault.Also being in a house with pets and hence a fair amount of dust, I wonder what future issues this might cause of dust settling inside on the exposed circuit board within. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to take canned air to it with a straw, but do note this is not a water or \u2018environment proofed\u2019 design.",
          "All the buttons and scroll wheel on my copy feel tight and clicky. No detectable rattle in normal use. So many reviewers have criticized the quality of this mouse, but that was when it was new. My experience buying this mouse a few years later was the complete opposite. This mouse is excellent. Great weight, nice shape, good feet, light and flexible cable, buttons feel solid. The complaints I have a very minor. The cable twists, the feet have sharp corners (no problems caused there yet), side button shape is kind of weird (not detrimental to gameplay). and the bulky rear end is a bit much for fingertip grip (for me, anyway. Your experience may vary. My hands are about 18cm long). If you like symmetrical claw grip mice, this is an excellent budget option. Would also work in fingertip for larger hands I'm sure.",
          "For reference, my hand size is about 19cm x 10cm and use claw grip. Previously, I've used other gaming mice such as Logitech G Pro Wireless, Finalmouse Ultralight Phantom, Finalmouse UL2, and G-Wolves Skoll.Pros:\u2022 53g total weight is incredible\u2022 M1 and M2 clicks were very crisp in my copy with no pre-travel\u2022 Side buttons are also crisp and had very minimal pre-travel\u2022 Scroll wheel has nicely defined steps and feels smooth\u2022 Middle click is tactile\u2022 Stock cable is just as good as paracordCons:\u2022 Not necessarily a con, but I'm not a big fan of the stock mouse feet and will be upgrading it whenever possible. While the stock mouse feet are made from PTFE, they're on the thinner side and its edges aren't rounded. When using a slower mouse pad like the Zowie GSR, you can feel some slight friction. I imagine this not being an issue with a faster mouse pad like the AMP500 or anything from Artisan. However, this doesn't mean the stock mouse feet are bad by any means. I've just been spoiled after market mouse skates from Hyperglide and Tiger Arc.Other Notes:\u2022 Side wobble on M1 and M2 were not present in my copy as noted in some complaints made online. I may have lucked out or received a newer batch that fixed these issues.\u2022 When gripping the mouse fairly hard on the sides, I wasn't able to replicate issues of the side buttons actuating. In fact, there wasn't any flex in the side walls at all.\u2022 I gave the mouse a good shaking and there wasn't any rattling either\u2022 Honestly, for $50, the MM710 gives you the best bang for your buck compared to other ultralight mice that are out there right now.\u2022 Shape is really important when choosing a mouse. While the MM710 is quite small, the wider and taller back makes a big difference in comfort. Claw gripping this feels perfect for my hand size. When comparing this shape to the Finalmouse UL2, I just couldn't get a comfortable grip on it without switching to fingertip grip because of the slimmer and shorter back.",
          "Everything about the mouse is fine except the software, which took multiple install attempts on a fully up to date windows system. Once it installed and settings were applied, it appears that I never have to touch it again, but that initial setup was a complete waste of time for software that should be extremely basic and painless to install and operate.",
          "This review has been written at 3 months of use. I was pretty apposed to getting a \"gaming\" mouse, but this perforated thing won me over. It's very light and maneuverable, it fits in my (small-ish) hand well, can't tell the wire is there, and the holes don't set off my texture sensitivity in any way. The extra buttons on the side are convenient and don't get in the way, and I've found the DPI switch in combination with the side buttons to be very useful for digital art. In terms of gaming, the high polling rate means less input lag over a regular mouse - which is always nice - and the MasterPlus software is clean, understated, and to the point. From what I've read in other Amazon reviews, earlier productions of this mouse had some quality control issues, none of which are fortunately present in the unit I purchased. The body is deceivingly strong, and can take a solid squeeze without deforming or actuating any of the buttons. Do remember that the holes can collect gunk and dust, so it may be wise to give it a wipe down and a burst of compressed air every couple of months. If you're looking for a cheap, functional gaming mouse without distracting lights or a weird space ship design, definitely take this one into consideration.",
          "Be sure to look up the dimensions of the mouse before blind buying the mm712. I assumed this would be average sized but it's not. Outside of the that the buttons and scroll wheel felt great. Just sad the size didn't work out for my 20x10cm hands",
          "I really like this mouse; it has a very nice tactile scroll and a satisfying click. My only issue is that it's a slightly smaller mouse than I'm used to. I had a zowie za11 for reference and that filled out my hand quite well but with this mouse I find myself constantly looking for a good spot to put my pinky. but over-all it feels like a quality mouse and performs as it should, it's just a little too small for me.",
          "Bought this for both of my sons. They absolutely love it.",
          "great mouse shape great wireless implantation but bad mushy clicks it is fixable though",
          "Excelente mouse, solo que pedi el glossy y me enviaron el matte, ojo ah\u00ed.",
          "I've owned this mouse for many many months and I got it after the left mouse button in my old razor became too mushy, it started affecting me when I was playing FPS games (mis-clicks). I wanted to try an ultra light mouse after hearing a lot of people hyping them up.It was great for a couple months, but then the left mouse button became very squishy, honestly I think whatever material the micro switch for the left mouse button is resting on has be come too fatigued because I repeatedly will click the mouse and it will not register. I can feel it when it does it. in a competitive shooter like R6 or CS Go, I generally don't have time to try again before I'm shot dead. Luckily for me, I'm no longer on a competitive team so I only play for fun, so I haven't gotten a new mouse yet.For non FPS games it works just fine. Most of the non-FPS games I play aren't life and death, if your mouse doesn't click the first time.As far the Ultra Light Mouse craze goes, I didn't gain any crazy advantage with it, my accuracy or flicks or even KD didn't change. I get used to a mouse pretty quickly. When I travel, the mouse in my laptop bag is a AA battery powered Logitech mouse which weighs 4-5x this one and I still have no problems. I also don't move my mouse much, space is limited on my desk so my mouse area is only 8\" wide, I don't often run out of space.A Pro & Con of this mouse is the lack of mouse software. it has pre-built in DPI functions, which is limiting, but at least I don't have to install some bloated Mouse Software from Logitech or Razor that will slow down my computer.",
          "Cooler Master MM711 is a great ultra-light gaming mouse. It is a honeycomb plastic body, making it very lightweight, but it feels very sturdy. It has an ambidextrous shape well-suited to all grip types, but due to its small size, I recommend it for small and medium-sized hands. It also has low click latency, a very low lift-off distance, and a wide CPI range. This mouse also has RGB lighting in the scroll wheel and around the palm. All in all a very good mouse for gaming",
          "I bought this mouse in december 2019, sadly in november 2022 the wire started failing, AFAIK I didn't kink the cable or anything but it started to get to the point where it would disconnect for a couple of seconds multiple times a day I used it for those 3 years non stop both for work and gaming so more than 10 hours daily",
          "Bought these mouse to replace my gpro superlight as I switched to mac. Some observations:1. Build quality is almost on par with the superlight2. In bluetooth mode, the sensitivity seems to increase compared to using the rf mode. (guess something to do with the polling rate difference) but something to take note of when constantly switching3. mouse wheel button, not as good as the gpro superlightThe negatives:1. (for mac users) To setup the mouse, need to do it in a windows based pc/laptop. No software in mac2. (my biggest issue), while using the dongle (rf mode), the mouse will disconnect during sleep and will not reconnect upon waking up the laptop. This is a glaring issue and might be some issue on mac or on the mouse itself but it is a big inconvenience.",
          "After using the G502 Proteus for almost 2 years (still an amazing mouse), being completely adjusted to it, I decided to venture out and try something new.  I have been wanting to get a lighter mouse since the Glorious Model O came but I couldn't get myself to purchase it after seeing all the problems with shipping/orders that a majority of people seemed to run into. I'm so happy I decided upon the MM710 with its more 'plump' back end, ergonomically for me it feels amazing.So, with all that being said. To answer some questions I'm sure everybody wants to know, that myself was worried about when I purchased it.Yes - Hybrid, Claw, Palm (for smaller hands) are the most ideal for this mouse.Yes - Going from G502 to this, it feels like there is literally nothing in your hand, I'm still getting used to the feeling.Yes - This mouse IS SMALLER then your typical gaming mouse, please account for this.Yes - Some reviewers complained of a rattle inside the mouse, my retail one still makes the rattle sound, BUT it is not nearly as loud as the prototype models. Seriously, you can barely hear it.No - The thumb mouse button 1 & 2 have not changed. They are still squishy when pressing them. If that's a deal breaker for you, I would look else where.Yes - The integrity of the shell (especially where the thumb buttons are) is more rigid and doesn't have much if it all flex when pressed in. Would also like to point out, nobody should be squeezing their mouse that hard anyways. Bad.No - They didn't completely fix the wobble of the mouse click buttons. Again, still improved from how bad some of the reviewer mice were.Hopefully this review helps some people figure out on whether or not to pull the trigger. Honestly, I've only used it for two days and don't think i'll ever be able to go back when I get used to this lightweight mouse. The MM710 is truly amazing, not to mention it's price point, and quick/no hassle shipping through amazon (looking at you Glorious Model). Just buy it already!",
          "It's a budget mouse that's emulating the more higher end stuff. If you don't want to spend 100+ for a lightweight mouse, say the ultra light 2 by final mouse for instance, then this is your best bet.  I think this mouse suits all play styles, but it depends on your hand size. Like, say if you have bigger hands(like me) and you play fingertip grip then you should be fine. If you have smaller hands you can play comfortably with palm grip. Claw grip is a sort of middle ground for hand sizes on this mouse I think.Material wise, I think the MM710 holds up to it's claims, because it really does stay clean and dust proof. There are some downfalls you could run into, BUT it's only because this mouse is budget. I feel the MM710 gets a lot of unnecessary scrutiny over the squishy RMB/LMB mouse switches(only when you press down hard on them) and the overall build quality feeling like a toy. I mean that's what's should be expected of the product; It's a no-brainer in that regard.My only problem with the mouse is that the side button switches can definitely be triggered by simply squeezing the side of the mouse,  but this is an issue that directly relates to the overall build quality of the mouse; A design flaw~ if you will.I still think the MM710 is a great competitor in the lightweight gaming mouse market despite the flaws cause of what it offers to the masses. Find a way to grip it such that you don't trigger the side button switches and the mouse is a dream to use if lightweight mouses are your thing or if you're looking to get into these archetypes of mouses.I'd have to say this mouse is a huge step up from my Logitech g502 Proteus. Not perfect, but my aim has improved significantly whilst using a 165hz monitor(overwatch,  apex legends, you name it) so a solid 3.5-4 stars out of 5 for me.",
          "Feels like a different plastic than a cheaper mouse. There could be more lighting effects. The click on the buttons is slightly loud, but overall it\u2019s a good value mouse for the price. It is kind of small for my hand.",
          "Lo utilice para jugar Fortnite es muy malo para hacer triple edits.El boton lateral se arruino despues de un a\u00f1o de utilidad, el explorer de win10 se me volvia loco y tuve que desactivar el boton da\u00f1ado en el software del mouse. Destape el mouse y vi q los botonoes laterales eran distintos a los m1 y m2. No recomendaria este mouse, no aguanta un 1 a\u00f1o en juegos competitivos. A Coolmaster le recomdaria mejorar los botones laterales sustituyendo esos botones baratos por los mismos omron del m1 y m2 y el dpi.",
          "I accidentally bought this mouse along with the G-Wolves Skoll mouse, forgetting to remove the later from my cart, so I decided to try them both out and compare the two. After seeing the great reviews of the Skoll from mouse enthusiasts and the very extra packaging and steel box, I fully expected my gaming performance to be much better on the Skoll, compared to the very simplistic MM710. The Skoll has an weird design that slightly raises your trigger finger, its got RGB lighting, and it is much bigger than the MM710. I suppose it's all personal preference, but after a full day of gaming with both of these mice, I found the MM710 to be much more accurate easier and smoother to use. It felt much more responsive and quicker than the larger Skoll mouse, which could be due to either its size or its better sensor or its lighter weight or all of the above. In summary, don't judge a book by its cover. Many reviews you see will say that it has all sorts of quality control issues; wobbly buttons etc. but these were apparently all solved when they changed their machinery to make the mice. My mouse has absolutely no defects and works flawlessly and I love it. This is the first product I have ever bought that is so good that I actually wrote a review for it. Buy this mouse.",
          "- Fingertip grip, 90% wrist aimer- DPI around 1800-2200 depending on mouse- Lenovo Legion mouse pad- Current mouse: MM710, gloss black coatingDespite it\u2019s bad build quality, my MM710 is easily my favorite mouse of all time, so the idea of getting a wireless version of that mouse with optical switches made me very excited. Unfortunately, Cooler Master has made a product that appears to be an across the board upgrade on paper, but in hand is actually worse in almost every way.Positives- The build quality is a MASSIVE leap over the MM710 and easily competes with the likes of Logitech or Razer while costing much less.- The weight balance of the mouse feels great. Doesn\u2019t feel front or back heavy at all to me.- When waking from sleep, the mouse connects almost instantly. Some wireless mice have issues with this and I appreciate that this one doesn\u2019t.- USB C connection. I know it\u2019s becoming the standard, but it\u2019s always nice to see.- The main clicks aren\u2019t as mushy as the MM710. They\u2019re much more solid and snappy.Negatives- The coating is not nearly as grippy as the glossy coating on my MM710. It\u2019s difficult for me to maintain a solid grip on the mouse, which means I\u2019m constantly having to adjust my fingers in order to keep control.- While most people are praising the removal of holes, I actually used the holes on the sides of the mouse to help anchor my fingers, especially my pinky. This meant that I didn\u2019t have to exert a lot of force on my fingers to keep them in place. With the solid sides, however, I have to use more force, which causes pain in my wrist in shoulders.- Every button on the mouse is harder to click than on the MM710. It\u2019s especially bad with the side buttons and the middle mouse click. The MM710 allows me to essentially \u201croll\u201d my finger or thumb over these buttons to press them, which makes it easy to quickly use them while maintaining a solid grip. The buttons on the MM712 require so much more force that I have to take my finger off the mouse and solidly press the button. This often results in an uncomfortable shift in my grip that forces me to readjust.- The RGB is pointless and only adds weight to the mouse without any real benefit to the user.Overall, I\u2019m disappointed in the mouse and will be returning it immediately.",
          "The updated MM710 is almost perfect.The Good -The updated version includes tapered teflon pads for a smooth experience right out of the box.The cord is nice and loose with good paracord as before, I do wish that it didn't come so bunched up but if you carefully massage out the kinks you will not have longevity issues with the cord.Mouse is a good shape for small hand palm grippers, but also good for larger hands that want to use claw or fingertip grip, particularly if you like resting a part of your hand on the mouse. I am personally a palm grip user, so this type of form factor is much more comfortable than the Razer or lightweight Logitech mice that did not allow for easy palm grip.This mouse is super light, your aim will suffer for a while as you get used to it, I would flick too far. However, after getting used to it, high speed movements are effortless. This is probably one of the lightest mice available out of the box aside from the Finalmouse Ultralight, which is almost always sold out, and is 2.5x the price.It appears that build quality by and large has been improved to a significant degree, the updated version (at least mine anyway) does not have the general rattling/creaking body and wheels that the prior versions had. The button wobble also seems to have been eliminated.The clicks of the individual buttons feel crisp and good in the hand.I won't even really talk about the sensor, as most gaming mice now have such good sensors that they are accurate beyond the realm of human detection.The Bad -The post-travel is still truly awful. If you palm grip like I do, then your fingers will be pressing on the mouse towards the front end, and you don't even need to press all that hard to have that terrible post travel. The button creaks and then travels down further, even causing it to \"fake\" click again due to the levering of the mouse button downwards at the tip, while raising the back end up the mouse button. It's terribly distracting, and makes it sometimes impossible to rapidly click in high-intensity situations. There are many solutions out there. I simply put in some cut up zip ties with double sided tape, bending the zip ties a little to contour to the shape of the mouse buttons. It seems that's all that's necessary now that they appeared to have fixed most of the button wobble and wheel rattling. However, the fact that I have to do that when it could have been fixed from the factory so very easily with a little lip of extra plastic at the tip is disappointing.As a minor issue, the mouse body does flex somewhat when you squeeze it with significant pressure that I would not expect most people to actually do in real life use. When I'm holding the mouse up in both of my hands and I squeeze the side, I can cause the forward and backward mouse buttons to click without physically touching the buttons. However, I found this very, very difficult to do when I use the mouse normally. Considering how light this mouse is, some structural strength is expected to be lost, but it is not noticeable in normal use.The software for the mouse still needs a few more features in my opinion, but all the important features are there, such as lift off distance, angle tuning, surface tuning, disabling DPI steps. I wish that the software had a DPI Shift feature like the Logitech Gaming Software does where it only changes the DPI as long as the button is being held down. Another weird software quirk I see is that when you press the DPI button, it doesn't change DPI right away, sometimes I have to stop the mouse for a second to let it \"think\" and then it goes back. It's super weird and not very responsive. Overall minor complaint. Coolermaster still appears to be updating the software, so we'll see what kind of features they might add.TL;DR - Mouse is almost perfect, good for smaller hands and most grips, likely lightest mouse available at this time. Button-post travel is still terrible, but easily fixed. Minor mouse body flex, not noticeable in normal use. Software still needs more development, but it appears CoolerMaster is working on it.",
          "Going from the G502 to the MM710 felt like I took off my training weights. What a world of difference. 2 years later, my MM710 is still going strong (despite my sweaty palms) and my G502 is still collecting dust.",
          "When you press on the shell from the sides you can hear (and make) the side buttons click, but it's not something that should occur during regular use, however it might be a build reliability concern.The lightness of this mouse is a novelty. You can play as fast as you did before but now with even lower sens, because it's a lot less tiring to move your hand, which allows you to be more precise and for longer periods of time.However, I found it incredibly hard to replicate a good grip. Although I like the idea of having holes in the shell, and think they help with grip, it would take me almost an hour of warm-up daily to build / restore muscle memory. Also, during high-stress gunfights, because the mouse is so light and hard to grip for me it would pick up on the jitters / shakiness of my wrist, something I didn't experience as much, or at least to a much lesser degree with larger and / or ergonomic mice.My favorite mouse in terms of shape and grip has always been the Zowie EC2-A but the plastic on the shell of that mouse is a sweat magnet which makes it unplayable for me in the long run, unless I wipe it with alcohol before every match (and I sweat just a normal amount during high stress, I never have \"wet\" hands). The plastic of the MM710 doesn't have this problem and feels quite good.The left and right (M1, M2) buttons feel good, but become increasingly harder to press the closer you get to the center of the mouse, which is a point to consider if you use claw grip. The best click on a mouse I've ever experienced was on Razer's Basilisk, both in terms of the material and resistance throughout the entire surface of the button(s).The spin of the MM710's wheel is the best I've used, and allowed me to execute long-range bhops consistently. The wheel's click also feels good.Everything considered, this mouse is worth the money but just doesn't fit me, so it won't become my main. I'd recommend it to people who use fingertip grip and / or have small hands.",
          "I want to say that I bought this mouse out of desperation. I have somewhat small hands and use a claw grip while using a mouse. I am a streamer and a gamer. Having a mouse that doesn't cramp my hand is extremely important, I also need a mouse to be fast reacting depending on the game I'm playing. I also need it not to make my hand sweat. Sweat is an issue when you've been playing a looter for 4+hours in a group.The Mouse I was using is GORGEOUS. It's sturdy, fast reacting, got pretty lights on it, BUT it's huge. It was purchased for my hubbs set up and it was KILLING the bridge of my hand. I was getting hand cramps all the time and having to take breaks live on stream because of it. So the Prime Sale came and I came across this one. Its pretty, white, I measured my hand and it seemed to be the right size. Price wasn't massive. I am so glad I did. Sweat is still an issue due to the slick buttons which is my main gripe but also the material though sturdy enough does feel like I could crush this with my teeny hands. So yay, I feel strong but I am really worried I might smush this thing. The rolling wheel is a decent size and has no wobble. The side buttons are placed well. The tap on this mouse is FAST. It's also really really lightweight. It feels like a toy it, with a mouse pad, glides so well..  I went back to using my husbands mouse for a day because we were trying to take excess stuff off our desk and it was a HUGE NOPE from me. I like this mouse. If you have smallish hands try it. Worst thing that can happen is that you can return it.",
          "i LOVE this mouse that i bought two of them, and going to buy another one in a different color. i cant tell you the amount of mice ive gone through just to find the perfect one for my hand size. from razer, to logitech, to other brands to the M710. i always find my way back to this mouse. i have really small hands and it just fits very well palm. its also a very light weight mouse that i personally would rather have weighting at exactly 60g. if obviously you have larger hands or prefer mice a bit heavier than this then obviously this isnt for you but if youre like me, a small gamer with smoll hands, then i recommend 100%. i hope one day they decide to make a wireless version of this.",
          "I have used this mouse as my daily driver for ~1 year now and it is quite good. It is very comfortable to hold and has a overall nice feeling in the hand. It is nice and lightweight, far lighter than any other gaming mouse I have personally used. Until recently, I never had issues with it for a very long time. The side buttons are placed at a convenient angle, and are comfortable to use for the most part. When I received the mouse, It only had one noticeable problem, and that was the fact that the right click button was a bit creaky. This is probably a manufacturing defect that doesnt happen often, so it should not determine whether or not you will purchase this mouse or not. The only 3 complaints I have with this mouse are: 1) The side buttons have quite sharp edges, and so when you glide your thumb from a pressed down button to a unpressed one, the angle can hurt it a little bit. 2) The mouse that I ordered was glossy. Its a completely my fault, however, because I should have ordered the nearly identical previous model, the M710. So this should also not determine whether you will buy the mouse or not. 3) The holes in the mouse get very dirty very quickly, and are pretty hard to clean, but with enough dedication it is possible to clean. The things that I love about this mouse are: 1) It is very cheap, and has indistinguishable performance to another, more expensive mouse. As long as the mouse is comfortable for you, it will serve the same purpose as another, more expensive mouse, just as effectively. 2) The weight. This mouse is very lightweight and is complemented with its good feet. It is very good for shooter games, where you might have to aim around quickly. It is especially good when coupled with a low aiming sensitivity, as it gives you lots of control over where you are aiming while not being hard to use because of its weight. Even the cord has been specially designed to be lightweight! 3) The mouse is spillproof. While it does have holes in its surface, all but a couple of hard to reach spots, such as the buttons (which are covered almost completely), are completely waterproof/spillproof. I'm pretty clumsy, so when I accidentally spilled my drink on the mouse the only side effect that happened was the mouse being sticky for a couple of days.The reason I am coming back and putting a review on the site is because, unfortunately, the mouse completely broke a couple of days ago. I believe it was from the cord breaking in some form. However I have abused it quite a bit and it has definitely survived the test of time. Right now I am using a spare mouse that I had before I bought the M711. Overall, I would suggest this mouse for anyone on a budget, or whoever just likes the design.Note: I forgot to add, the RBG is excellent, and can light up my entire desk alone.  The software is also mid tier, not bad but not the best.",
          "im someone with really small hands that mainly play fps games. this mouse is the best shaped mouse i have ever used. trying to adjust to a new mouse after using it was atrocious due to how naturally my hand fit with this mouse. however i do have several issues with it, mainly due to build quality.for starters the side buttons feel mushy and i dont like how theyre shaped on the side. this wasnt a big issue for me since i used this mouse only for playing games. the dealbreaker for me was the quality of the main buttons, in particular the right click. if i held it down to scope in and i didnt hold it down hard enough, it would wobble which was incredibly annoying for me personally. i tested it and if i held the button down harder it would be fine so it was rare but it occurred frequently enough and was annoying enough to convince me to switch to a different mouse.tldr; amazing shape, perfect for me personally but button wobble was enough of an issue for me to switch to a different mouse.",
          "\u00a0Updated review got my 2nd copy it's flawlessThis shape is one of the best for Claw!! This is my 2nd favorite shape after za13-c. Big humps are always great to have more control over your mouse providing more accuracy in games. 57g on my scale I really wish it was lower than that 45-50g will be the sweet spot for this imo also appreciate the included grips but those r not really gripy if anything it just makes it more soft and also adds bit of weight. I'm hoping for cooler master to release next version with same shape sub 50 weight and maybe a lower weight battery smth like g pro x superlight has. And oh forgot to mention scroll wheels are super smooth some ppl might perfer that but I would have liked to have step in my scroll wheel. Other than those small nit picks one of the top budget mouse great product for the price",
          "Looks like Cooler Master did a good job on picking up on modern mouse design and feature trends but missed out the iterative design history that led that point, leading to amateur design flaws not found in mice from pretty much any established mouse manufacturer.The mouse has sharp corners designed for looks that will scratch against your mousepad when you lift it off the mat, causing rough landings, or even by applying uneven pressure to the mouse. Not only does it cause inconsistent glide performance but probably damage your mouse pad as well.Click force required is higher than I would have liked.That said the weight is nice, sensor is high quality, and the cable is the softest I have ever used and helps greatly with glide consistency.",
          "[*UPDATE* Right after I posted this review, I started to issues with the wireless reliability. I deducted one star as it can still be used normally, but not in a competitive environment. The latency is not an issue, but I started having \"jagged-ness\" in large arm swipes that I could see and feel. It definitely has some polling issues that need to be sorted.  See the photos at the end to show polling stability compared to an Xtrfy MZ1 Wireless. Hopefully it is something that can be solved with future firmware updates.]I felt like writing this review just because I felt it deserved some recognition for how great it really is. I was a big fan of the MM711 when it first came out. The shape was unique and the weight was extremely impressive. I stopped using it mostly because of the switches being inconsistent and the build quality was not the greatest. I had always been hoping they would make a version of this shape, but with a better build quality and better switches. They honestly exceeded my expectations with this new MM712.I'll go through all the changes that I think are worth mentioning from the MM711 to MM712.1. Wireless. The wireless tech on this mouse is perfect for me. I have not had a single drop-out mid game or anything odd. I've been using it for probably around a month in a competitive environment and in day-to-day use and haven't had a single issue.2. Hole-less design. The previous MM711 had holes to reduce the weight of the mouse. Having no holes helps the mouse be more comfortable to use for long periods of time and also helps with build quality issues. I definitely prefer having a solid shell, especially on the sides of the mouse.3. Coating. This is an underrated change I think. The coating on this mouse is so much better than the MM711. The MM711 has this really smooth plastic-y feel that was just really slippery over time and just not the most confidence inspiring grip. This version has a high quality feel slightly textured surface that grips up a lot when you start to get a little sweaty when gaming. It's very good in my opinion.4. Mouse 1 and 2 switches. The MM711 had some Omron switches that felt okay, but I think because of the build quality of the mouse, it had really inconsistent/mushy feeling clicks. In some games that have really heavy flicking, it would be obvious that your flicks sometimes would just not be where you wanted them to be because of the clicks. The MM712 has optical switches that are nice and consistent. If you have used Kahlil 8.0 switches in the past, you know how they quickly degrade over time. These have felt the exact same since I got the mouse and have never had a moment where I felt like I was held back because of the switches not working correctly.Now for the things that I would like to see changed (which isn't a whole lot honestly).The side buttons are a little stiff in my opinion. I'm not sure what switches they are, but they are okay at least. The rear side button takes more force the further you press towards the back of the mouse. I would like it to be the same force required to actuate it on all sides of the button. Not a huge deal.Another thing is the mouse wheel clicking down force. It's also a little stiffer than I would personally prefer. I use that button to ping in some games and it takes a pretty significant amount of force to actuate the scroll wheel click. Again not a huge deal since it still works perfectly, but the force required should definitely be a little bit less.Another issue I have is one that I haven't noticed before on any mouse. At first I thought my mouse sensor was dying because the liftoff distance felt like it was changing and wasn't working correctly, but I found out later that it was because there was dust building up right on top of the mouse sensor at the bottom of the mouse. I've never had that happen before on a mouse before, but it seems to happen pretty quickly on this mouse. I would recommend blowing out the dust like every day or so to make sure there isn't any on the sensor. Not sure what causes that to happen to some mice and not others, but that would be a small thing I would try and remedy as well (maybe thicker mouse feet would help mouse go over the dust and not pick it up? Not sure).Also a couple small things I would like to see updated would be a battery indicator on the wireless dongle, since most of the time I have the lighting effects turned off on the mouse to save battery life. Having it on the dongle would help not use nearly as much battery life as having it on the mouse, and it's still easily in view. I believe Razer has implemented this recently. Also sometimes I have a small software issues or something where if I changed the input on my USB switch, the lighting turns back on for some reason. It's almost like it selects a different profile for my mouse or something. I have to go back to my main PC and open the software back up to turn it back off. Not sure why this happens, but a small thing none the less. Usually happens if I click my USB switch to changes devices too fast.As much as people want to tell you that you need the top of the line mouse and spend 150+ dollars to be good at a video game, I can tell you right now you just do not need to spend that kind of money on a gaming mouse. This mouse is 70 dollars and checks basically every box the top dogs have. The only difference is they use a 3370 sensor instead of the 3395 (current gen as of this review) and some use 4K polling vs 1K polling on this mouse. As someone who takes gaming pretty competitively, you just will not be a better gamer on a more expensive mouse just because it has a better sensor or higher polling than 1k.The Cooler Master team for the mouse peripheral side of things should be proud of making this mouse. It's leaps and bounds of an iteration improvement over the last generation. I'm glad they bounced back with this after the MM731 debacle. Good job *thumbs up*",
          "To start, this is an awesome product overall.  My only complaint can easily be remedied if you are willing to put in a little bit of effort.  The rgb and button programming is simple and easy to use, the weight is light and feels pretty balanced.  Personal favorite and I can't imagine much that would make me want to switch.......Except maybe this one thing:  the glossy finish makes it difficult to hold and control at times, especially if your hands get sweaty while playing.  I wish I could have gotten a matte one, but none were available anywhere I looked.  I fixed this by cutting and applying some tape for better grip.  It worked pretty well.What I liked:  Super lightweight, one of the lightest mice you can buy, even with the rgb.  I picked this model because the rgb looks better on camera.  It is easily programmable and saves into the mouse memory so you don't need an app running or installed on every computer you use it with.  It feels like it could still use some improving, but I could also just not know how to customize it correctly.  Cable is also super lightweight and feels almost effortless to move.  The mouse overall, especially for me moving from a G502 Hero, feels almost weightless when you hold it for the first time.  And this feeling doesn't really go away much once you et used to it.  If you like ultra light mice.  This could be for you.",
          "Very nice mouse, very sturdy and lightweight great for gaming and work.",
          "I bought this mainly for it's dual wireless feature. I'm able to game wirelessly on my windows PC and then seamlessly switch to bluetooth mode and use it on my MacBook.",
          "Bought in 2020 and used heavily everyday, but now the middle mouse button is starting to seize up. My Logitech G9 on the other hand is still going strong after 10 years.",
          "I switched from Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro to this Cooler Master MM712 and the battery life is terrible. The DeathAdder would get 30+ hours of usage without charging, but this MM712 only lasts about 12 hours.I exclusively use bluetooth so not sure if that would make a difference.The website claims bluetooth should get 180hrs but that is nowhere near what I'm seeing.",
          "I wanted a mouse that could compete the Razer Viper Mini that was wireless. Of course, the Signature Edition is a thing but way out of my budget and wanted wireless mouse under $100. I previously used the Glorious Model O Wireless and it was great but it's battery life was terrible and needed something smaller. At first, I was hesitant to try the MM712 because the reviews on the MM710/11 was poor build quality. However, the MM712 is the exact opposite with exceptional durability and a way longer battery life up to 3 days with a charge time of under 2 hours. I do want to point out the sensor placement on the MM712 as it is positioned higher than any gaming mouse out there. It actually did make a big impact in my performance as general dragging and flicking made it too fast overshooting my targets, forcing me to lower my in-game DPI by like 10%. It did take some getting used to but now got the hang of it. In my opinion, this outranks the Viper Mini in wireless connectivity (obviously), but I prefer the shape of the Viper Mini with the hump in the middle and not the MM712 with the hump towards the back. The MM712 will be my wireless main for the time-being and is now my personal #1. Of course, I highly recommend.",
          "I was a long time user of the MM710, the shape was perfect, but the build quality was awful. On this one, they managed to keep the weight low, keeping the same shape without holes, so good job for that. The clicks are good, not the best, but for optical switches, they are pretty tactile and responsive. I love the scroll wheel on it. You'll have to get used to the sensor position coming from other mouse, it can be a little bit disturbing at first. but the main drawback is the wireless implementation, it looks like it's not perfect, I had some stutters, didn't keep the tracking well. Coming from mainstream mice like Logitech or Razer, it's very average. Using it wired, no complains, but who's gonna buy it to keep it wired? Otherwise, it would be a great mouse.",
          "\u00a0Update for the 3rd which is black version. The same problem that the under cover is not flat, it's is better than the last two, but it is still hard to use especially on the hard pad. I will not recomend this currently, even I am the fan of this shape. I have already replaced one, this is my second mouse. They have the same problem that the under cover is not flat, and you can see by eyes. I am going to return this and try the black one. All the other I'll say is great, but if it is not flat, it is really hard to use.",
          "This is a great mouse! It lives up to the hype and number of great reviews, imo :) It is extremely light, the lightest mouse I have ever tried personally. I also tried the Razer Viper Mini & Razer Abyssus Essential in the search for my next mouse. I ended up choosing the Razer Abysssus Essential over the other two mice, as the MM710 & Razer Viper Mini are more shaped & suited for a claw grip, not a fingertip grip which I use. The MM710 was more adaptable and could work using a fingertip grip, but I think it would shine with a claw grip user more.The MM710 has very crisp buttons, pretty cool look with the holes, great sensor that was very accurate, okay software for changing the DPI settings on the mouse, good side buttons for assigning macros to, and very light weight making it easy to lift off the mouse and quickly move the cursor from one side of the screen to the other. I did think the left & right mouse buttons were a little too easy to press, at least for me. I enjoyed the Abyssus Essential's mouse buttons more, as they require roughly 2x the force to press, which I personally like more.I highly recommend buying this mouse and trying it, with the ability to return it for free meaning there is no downside to buying it :)",
          "*Concerning build quality - I got mine a little less than month ago and my copy is actually very solid. No rattles at all. The 1 & 2 buttons do have some play but not enough to affect me in-game or whatever else I'm doing. Mouse buttons 4 & 5 have some post-travel but only when pushing hard. I was able to get mouse button 4 to actuate when pressing the side of mouse but it was quite a lot of force to make it happen. I would say that the build could be better, but you really have to try to get the flaws to show.Regarding the general usage - I'm giving this mouse 5 stars just because of how great the shape is. My hand is about 19.5cm by 9.5cm and it feels so good with any type of grip. I had used multiple Deathadders before then I switched to the Model O. I used to be 100% palm grip but I changed somewhat to claw because of the Model O. Because of this change, the Model O felt way too big so I decided to get this. And it was honestly $50 well spent. I use fingertip grip and now it feels so natural and so comfortable. Luckily, I was also able to sell off my Model O for the same price I got it for since Glorious was out of stock at the time.Sidenote - My younger brother got the Model O- and he's been bugging me to switch mice with him...I will say though, the O-'s build quality is better than both my old O and this MM710."

          "Having owned and tested many different gaming mice. This is one of the best mice on the market, but in my experience, the shape needs improvement.This mouse has excellent build quality, better than many mice I've tested. Absolutely no creaks or flexing, even though its so lightweight it's extremly solid and all feels like 1 very solid piece. All the buttons and scroll wheel are great and feel like very good quality. The shell material has a nice texture and feels great.The weight is one of the best you can get with very few rivals in it's range they say it's like 48 grams which is about as light as mice get. The feet glide really nice. The cable is one of the best you can get and is super flexible, and The 3389 sensor is top of the line.The 1 problem is the shape (and the software is buggy and needs improvement but we won't get into that). The shape is not very comfortable, it's close to good except the part in the front of the mouse on the right side where your ring finger touches next to the right click button flares out too much, kind of like a razer viper and because of the extra size there, your ring finger pushes against it and it causes the mouse to rotate out of alignment counter clockwise (I had the same problem with the viper) so your not holding the mouse straight, it's cocked to the left a little, and your pointer/index finger ends up to far to the right on the left click button right up against the scroll wheel. Also the left click button is too low for an ergo mouse it needs to be raised slightly in relation to the right click button, it all comes together to make the mouse feel less like an ergo and more like an ambidexterious (it feels somewhere in between those). The comfort and ergos on the glorius model D, or the cooler master mm720 for example are much better.So in conclusion, I had to take off 2 stars for the ergos, but it gets 3 for everything else. Unfortunately the ergos are kind of a deal breaker. A mouse has to fit the hand really well. Cooler master has potentially one of the best mice ever made here, but they need to revise the ergonomics. If people who work at cooler master are reading this, please listen: fix the ergos and shape and you will have one of the best mice on the market with very little competition.",
          "If this mouse was completely driverless, it would be perfect. I tried everything to get this mouse to stop skipping around and nothing worked. What I did:1. Clean boot2. Reinstall software3. SFC and DISM4. Reinstall WindowsI knew going in that there were issues, but I had also seen that a new firmware was released that supposedly had fixed those problems.I have owned pretty much all of cooler masters mice, starting with the Xornet. I don't know exactly what is wrong, but it seems like everything has gone down hill in this department of cooler master specifically because of software hiccups.",
          "The shape felt decent to me, but this will always be subjective. With that said, it doesn't really have any sharp edges or curves that could turn people away too much, so it should be ok for most people. Clicks sounded hollow, not mushy, but not exactly that crisp either. Overall, it was ok, can't fault it too much, but I returned it cause it didn't match my set up.",

I use a fingertip grip for reference. They should reduce the right side bump by 5-10 mm because it sticks out too far. ALSO Id like them to reduce the length from the back and round it off more. If you do like a backside lifted flick the sharp bottom tends to drag into the mousepad more than other mice ive used. Lastly, they really need to upgrade the mouse feet. They are good but far too thin and oddly concaved on that back feet.",
          "I ended up returning this mouse because it would drag on my mousepad and make a scratching noise.  It seems like the feet/skates needed to be a little thicker to give some more clearance between the bottom of the mouse and the mousepad.",
          "Weight&shape were good, and stock grip tape was ok (a little too thick imo). Stock mouse feet are horrible. Had an ok glide out of the box but are super thin (can see the lighting of the mouse through them thin). After 15 hours of web browsing and 10 hours of games, noticed the glide was not smooth. went to check the feet and mouse pad, and had noticed the severe scratching on the mouse pad (glorious air hard mouse pad pictured). I have only used this pad for 2 weeks, and it looked brand new when I had first started using the mm730. Don\u2019t buy this (wired or wireless) until they revise the mouse feet, or are willing to buy after market feet when those become available.",
          "I love this mouse. It's both sensitive when I want it to be and easy to use. It's comfortable for long hours both when I'm working during my day and then I can easily shift to gaming in my evenings. With 19000 adjustable DPI, sensitivity is more than enough for my editing work and lets me react quickly in game. Glide is very smooth, even on harder, less smooth surfaces. It comes with a very long cord that allows me to use it anywhere relative to my computer and really is snag-free. But with bluetooth and wireless capabilities the cord is not necessary with most systems. It's compatible with all systems I've encounter so far.  The internal battery allows it to recharge as needed (but I rarely need to recharge it). Soft rubber pads come with it for better grip, but are optional (you need can attach them if you want to).",

Just a closet mouse enthusiast. im sure people will get different results depending on the program they use and surface, but im convinced after verifying the data myself. Im also performing better in valorant so that\u2019s nice.Just do not open and use. Download, update and you\u2019ll be set.",
          "2023 updateThis is the first Coolermaster mouse I've owned. Came from using a Glorious model D. I originally bought the black version but immediately returned it seeing that I could see my finger oils left on it. The white version is holding up wellI grew to like the shape. It required me adjusting how I grip the mouse.Overall the mouse feels good in the hand. Crisp clicks. The white braided cable is nice and flexible. I find that the mouse is a bit slippery. With my old grip I could not lift it properly. I feel that the coating on the mouse could be better. .5 reduction in review scoreYou can tell Coolermaster skimped out on the USB extender and dongle. They are not color matched. They are the same solid black that came with the black version of the mouse. If it USB extender and the dongle were color matched to grey I would have rated the mouse higher. I am taking .25 off my rating.Firmware for the mouse and dongle was easy to update to the latest firmware so there is no noticeable lag.As another reviewer has said. The stock skates are a bit thin. My current mousepad is the Coolermaster Codura pad. The mouse glides smoothly but not as quiet as I would want. I am thinking that the bottom of the mouse is scraping across the pad. I could be wrong tho. My model d glides a bit quieter and smoother IMO.I think the logo placement on the mouse is horrible. The curvature of the mouse does not do it justice, I get they wanted to implement RGB into the mouse and have their branding. I think the CM logo should have been on the side of the mouse or on the left or right buttons.Taking out the RGB could have reduced the weight even more and possibly increased battery life. Granted I have turned the RGB off on day one.Bluetooth was a feature that I really didn't think I would use all that much. While working from home. It's been a godsend. I feel as though the Bluetooth implementation could be better when switching from wireless to Bluetooth to my company laptop The sensor skips a fair bit. It requires switching the Bluetooth on and off then it works perfectly.Overall I find this mouse to be a good starting point for cooler Master.One thing I do miss and think could be a good addition to the version. 2 of this mouse is adding back the DPI button",
          "I've been waiting for this mouse for a while and was wary about pulling the trigger on it since reviewers have been saying there is a 'floaty' feel to it and that it has high motion delay as well as 'slam clicks.' I wanted to try it for myself and while it may have had high motion delay and slam clicks when it was first released, the newest firmware update seems to solve most of that. After doing testing with MouseComparator, a 3rd party app for mouse testing, i've found it to be exactly on par with the Razer Viper Ultimate, yet i find it way more comfortable since it's a right-handed ergonomic mouse versus an ambidextrous mouse. Slam clicks were happening because they are optical switches with practically zero debounce time. The firmware update probably solved that by adding in a 1-2ms delay for the clicks since the earlier reports of slam clicks seem to be going away now.If you were on the fence about the mouse due to the software/firmware issues, their firmware update should put you at ease and i recommend you try it for yourself. One thing you need to make sure to do is to be plugged in as wireless when opening the software in order to update. I have no idea why, but if you're not in wireless, it tells you to switch to wireless, but then the software won't recognize the mouse UNLESS you completely exit the software from the system tray. So just need to make sure that you're in 2.4ghz mode and it's a completely fresh start of the software, and you shouldnt have issues updating. Yes, this is inexcusable and Cooler Master better be working on solving the hassle of updating, but for now, that is the workaround.Other than that, the features speak for themselves. Insanely lightweight. You won't know what you're missing until you use a lightweight gaming mouse. All the high-end specs without added weight really makes a different when swiping and for long term gaming.Battery life is good and i havent really had the need to charge. The mouse comes with a dongle extender, which basically a female type c usb to type a adapter. It's a nice touch actually. i keep the dongle plugged into the adapter and sitting on my desk and then i keep the wire plugged into the back of my PC. I'll just switch the wire from the adapter to the mouse when i'm finished for the day so i really don't know how many days the battery lasts but definitely makes it throughout the entire day.It has 19,000 DPI, which is really just marketing fluff since that doesnt really matter. The more important number is 400 IPS (inches per second), and that's better/on par with gaming mouse. Basically means your tracking will be on point.The PTFE feet are really smooth and comparable to most aftermarket upgrades for other mice i've used. Some people have been saying theyre thin and scratches their pad? i havent had any experience with that in the few days i've been using it and i have a cordura pad.All in all, really satisfied and happy i decided to try it at this time. I'll be maining this mouse for awhile to come.",
          "This mouse if probably the best value gaming mouse you can purchase right now. However, it seems to have some QC issues.I\u2019ll start with what I\u2019ve found that makes the first statement true:1. Top sensor, the PAW 3370 (both the Ninjutso Origin One X and the Steelseries Prime lack this and have an inferior PAW-3335).2. Optical Switches which may not be preferred by all but should prevent any double-clicking issue from arising (Logitech G Pro Superlight lacks this)3.  At 59g it is one of the lightest wireless mice around (lighter than the Razer Viper Ultimate or the Logitech G Pro Superlight).4. It claims a really long 140-hour battery life.5. It has USB type C (the Logitech G Pro Superlight lacks this).If I wanted to tick most of these boxes, I\u2019d need to buy a Razer Viper Ultimate, but it is also heavier and should be replaced soon (kind of old at this point). I could also purchase a Roccat Kone Pro Air, but people are reporting scroll wheel issues.Unfortunately, I have been let down. The mouse enthusiast community is reporting sensor issues. Personally, I don\u2019t feel the issues, but you should be aware some issues can exist. What I did find in my unit is a so called \u201cslam click\u201d whereas lifting the mouse and placing it back on the mousepad causes a click to register, it doesn't require much force, so I feel like it is an important QC issue. My other issue is related to the scroll-wheel, and it may not affect everyone. The scroll-wheel is too stiff so when I scroll the mouse moves down. This is probably a combination of scroll-wheel stiffness and the lightweight nature of the mouse, but I find it quite distracting because I had never encountered it before. Finally, the mouse just doesn\u2019t feel \u201cergo\u201d to me. I have a small hand, but it doesn\u2019t fill it like my Razer Basilisk X does or even the smaller Logitech G305 my girlfriend has. It\u2019s because the MM731 doesn\u2019t really have a hump on the back, so it always leaves space between my palm and the mouse. This is more preference than anything else and maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding what the community means by \u201cergo\u201d, but those are my two cents and I will be returning it.",
          "I have read a lot of things about this mouse, but I want to just speak out and say that my experience has been great.The mouse feels sturdy, the connectivity has been flawless (other than some update hitches, more on that below). Cooler Master has been working non-stop to fix any issues with these mice, and you can find that by searching for \"Cooler Master MM731 Replacement\".I've seen mention of many different issues, including build quality. In my experience with this version which is the reworked batch 12128(per the Cooler Master replacement page), and have experienced zero build quality concerns.The only issue I ran into is that I needed to close the tray app (little cooler master logo) in order to get the mouse to update to the latest firmware.I highly recommend giving this mouse a try, because the weight and feel is unreal.",
          "I had been looking for a lightweight gaming mouse to replace my Logitech G502 that finally wore out. I know there is a wireless option for the G502 now but I wanted something with less weight that could also do bluetooth so I ended up with the MM731. The build quality is really good and even though the mouse is extremely light it doesn't seem like there are any weak points that will wear out quickly. One thing that drew me to this model particularly was that it didn't have the swiss cheese cutouts all over it to cut down on weight. I don't know how Cooler Master did it but they managed to keep the aesthetic looking pretty \"normal\" vs \"gamer\" in my opinion.While I bought it primarily to use on my gaming computer I was surprised with how robust the software was in allowing me to set up macros and customize buttons for things like Office or web browsing. The mouse worked great right out of the box while wired and paired to my laptop via bluetooth with a simple button press. While using the 2.4GHz dongle I noticed the mouse seemed \"slow\" but once I updated the firmware it worked as it should and was on par with being corded as far as responsiveness goes.The mouse feels good in your hand and I didn't experience that \"new mouse feel\" you get when switching to a new model. The scroll wheel isn't smooth but for some reason I think that is by design because I am far more accurate with the distance I scroll in games now compared to the looser Logitech wheel. The mouse buttons all feel crisp and have a satisfying click sound. I can't tell you if the optical mouse switches are any better than a physical switch, they feel exactly the same, which they should. If it lasts longer because of the switch type, even better.I can't really say anything bad about this mouse. It is simple yet gives me lots of options for connectivity and customization. I like the simple RGB light and subdued branding that isn't screaming at me the way a couple green snakes would. The box included some extra feet as well so they plan on you keeping this mouse quite a while it seems. I think this would be a great choice for most people that want something lightweight and focused on simplicity without sacrificing customization.",
          "Bought it and have no issues after FW update. The software is pretty barebones but does what it\u2019s supposed to. If you\u2019re looking for areally lightweight wireless mouse for gaming specifically, can\u2019t go wrong with this one.",
          "I wanted to like this mouse by  Cooler Master but it wasn't for me. To be honest it felt a little rushed in my opinion and you could kind of tell in the fine details. For starters the sticker on the bottom with the serial number is almost flush which is unfortunate because when I move the mouse around the sticker drags and scratches. I found myself constantly trying to push the sticker down to stop it from dragging on my pad. Second when I plug the mouse in and updated the software and firmware that was a pain because the software updates with the mouse plugged in but the firmware updates over wireless which creates a problem because when the software updates it looses the mouse then you have to plug it in for it to recognize it again then you update the firmware but you can't because the mouse is plugged in it can only update over wireless so when you unplug it the pointer doesn't move because the mouse isn't recognized so yeah. I ended up eventually having to use another mouse plugged in simultaneously to get over this obstacle. The shape of the mouse is okay tracking was okay nothing that stands out tbh. I gave it a shot because I'm somewhat of a mouse enthusiast but I'd probably pass on it",
          "I\u2019m a pretty casual gamer, nothing hardcore, but after using my husband\u2019s I decided to treat myself and get one. I originally wanted white to match my set up, but it wasn\u2019t in stock at the time of purchase and I didn\u2019t want to wait.Apparently there were some issues with the mouse out of the box but since one of the first things I did was download the software and update it, I did not encounter any of the weird motion delay that was being reportedOther than that, here is my breakdown:ProsShapeSuper lightweightRGB (if you care about that thing)High sensor placementWirelessGreat sensorConsThin skatesScroll wheel a little stiffI feel some scratching but might be different depending on mouse pads. Scroll wheel is heavier than I\u2019m used to but it\u2019s not a dealbreakerOverall, It\u2019s a 9/10 for me. The shape is fantastic. Feels like a perfect mix of Microsoft\u2019s Intellimouse and Zowie\u2019s EC series.",
          "Bought this on a whim while searching for mice that fit 3 criteria:1. Must be ergo.2. Must be sub 50g in weight.3. Must be wired.The mm730 checks all of these boxes and more. This things feels great in the hand and I really like how the clicks feel compared to my Deathadder v2. The biggest selling point is probably the weight, 49g for the white mouse. This is insane, almost a 40G difference from the DA v2 Pro. It really is like nothing's there.As for the size/shape, the mm730 is a little smaller than the DA-- but I'm still able to claw grip too. It's just as comfy. I was honestly expecting to compromise in this department switching to a Coolermaster, but I'm very impressed.Couldn't think of too many cons: maybe I wish the sides were textured? But after some use, I kind of like it. Coolermaster software could be better. All in all, this is endgame for me. I really like this mouse, and think I will stick with it for a long time.",
          "I suffer from RSI and finally decided to upgrade my mouse to a lighter option. I wanted one that\u2019d be good for gaming and then came across coolermasters mouse randomly. It checks all the boxes I\u2019m looking for: lightweight, good sensor, wireless. Since it has both Bluetooth and 2.4 wireless, I can have bluetooth assigned to my work laptop and easily switch back and forth throughout the day while working from home.After updating the firmware like other reviews suggest, I havent suffered from any noticeable delay or response time issues so no complaints there.",
          "I have used PUC, GPW,DA V2. And this is the mouse i will main. Mouse needs updated to eliminate motion delay. Shape is very similar to iconic ec2. Weight is fantastic, 59g without holes. The shape+ weight make micro adjustments so easy, you will see big improvement in aim and flick. Skate is alright, too thin IMO. Sensor is top tier at the moment. The best thing about this mouse is optical switch, this is a much better version compared to razer optical, never double click, closest thing to japanese omron d2f, light and consistent.But QC seriously needs to improve. I have 2 copies and each if them, switches has totally different feeling. Sticker at the bottom of the mouse is poorly aligned, created a scratch to mousepad.",
          "\u00a0First mouse with no holes and rgb at 49g",
          "I thought this would be like an EC mouse but there the shape is off and couldn't find it as comfortable. Maybe it's just me but the ultra lightness seems to make it feel cheap but that's not their fault. It's an industry trend",
          "Although I can't write about the long-term use of this mouse, I must say that compared to the go pro wireless, which I spent almost triple on, this mouse takes the cake as the better mouse. It's far lighter, doesn't seem to have the god awful double clicking issue of Logitech mice, and has USB C (Thank god.) I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an ergonomic mouse similar to the Logitech G403, but want a lighter mouse that's also wireless. I have no issues with the tracking of the mouse as the software update they made eliminated that issue it had on initial release.",
          "the mouse overall is pretty good and inexpensive ... the only bad parts are the horrible software and the fact you will need to replace the super thin skates.",
          "the mousewheel scrolls the opposite direction every 3/4 notches... CM wants me to pay $ to return...",
          "I've used this mouse for two days, i've had issue with motion delay on the mouse when using wireless mode.________________Positive :Nice ergo shape,decent build quality,nice coating that doesn't attract sweat/fingerprint,nice feel to the switches.Sensor placement didn't bother me.I mainly use claw grip and this shape works wonder for me.Sadly the shape doesn't make the product by itself._____________________Negative:The battery life on my copy was not great even with all RGB turned off.CM masterplus is pretty bad too, you need to update your mouse in wired mode after that unplug it,put it in wireless mode and update again for the wireless mode.Alot of motion delay in the wireless mode compared to other wireless mice._________________For reference, i have the G pro Superlight X,Glorious Model O Wireless,Origin one X, EG XM1I previously used the Origin one X which has a similar shape.If you like this kind of shape i recommend buying the Origin One X instead.Edit: Seems that the mouse just died out of nowhere 2 hours after i wrote this review.Got a replacement from amazon will see if it last.I don't recommend buying one yet, wait for second batch.",
          "I recently purchased the Cooler Master mm731 wireless mouse and I have to say, I'm extremely impressed with its performance. The mouse is responsive, accurate, and comfortable to use, making it a great addition to my home office setup.One of the things I love about this mouse is its wireless connectivity. It connects seamlessly to my computer without any lag or interference, and the battery life is impressive, so I don't have to worry about constantly recharging it.The design of the mouse is also top-notch. It's sleek and ergonomic, fitting comfortably in my hand for long periods of use. The button placement is intuitive, and the scroll wheel is smooth and precise, making it easy to navigate through documents or web pages.In terms of performance, the Cooler Master wireless mouse is excellent. It's accurate and responsive, which is essential for precise movements in design software or gaming. The customizable DPI settings are a great touch, allowing me to adjust the sensitivity of the mouse to my preferences.Overall, I highly recommend the Cooler Master wireless mouse to anyone in need of a reliable, comfortable, and high-performance mouse. It's a great investment that has improved my productivity and overall user experience.",
          "This is exactly what I was looking for!!Great mouse. Solid quality, good specs, crazy lightweight. Just like what everyone says though: update firmware using the MasterPlus software.",
          "I decided to take a chance and try it despite negative youtube reviews. I\u2019m not disappointed. Out of the box the sensor had some noticeable motion delay, but after installing the Coolermaster software and updating firmware, there are now no issues. the wireless feels just as fast as the wired. maybe only slower by a few ms which is pretty standard for being wireless.by far the best feature of the mouse is the weight. less than 60 grams means it\u2019s lighter than other gaming mice, especially being wireless. it\u2019s strong and sturdy without any holes like other mice.the PTFE feet are a nice touch too. comparable to other aftermarket feet I\u2019ve purchased in the past for other mice.so in the end, if the only thing holding you back was tbr laggy sensor, i suggest taking a chance now since it\u2019s fixed.",
          "I've had two of these mice- one from warranty and one I got from Amazon. I've used both over a period of five months so I feel like I've given the MM731 and Cooler Master ample time to fix it's issues. Over these last five months, I've had nothing but a terrible experience. Both mice had a range of issues including:- freezes and lag spikes in wireless mode- horrendous software that was unresponsive and borderline unusable- scroll wheel jumping- weird bug where the mouse would seemingly halve in DPI suddenly (it would persist for several hours and could not be fixed by resetting DPI in software)- weird bug where the mouse would get slower over timeThe one saving grace for this mouse was its shape. But the issues above made this one of the worst mice I've ever bought. The quality issues with this $100 mouse makes me never want to buy from Cooler Master again.",
          "This is perfect for people with claw grip or palm-claw-hybrid grip AND aims with their wrist more than their arm. The sensor placement being so forward will take some huge adjustments, but once you get a handle on it, you will quickly realize that it is absolutely perfect for claw/palm-claw grip + wrist aiming.The weight will also take some huge adjustments considering how light this mouse is. I used the Logitech G Pro Wired prior to this mouse and had to drop my sensitivity in Valorant from 0.377 down to 0.25-0.3. It felt like Rock Lee taking off his training weights. The weight makes a huge difference in terms of fatigue. The Logitech G Pro wired is only 85g, but dropping to 48g was significant enough that you can really feel the difference in fatigue in \"longer\" game sessions (30 minutes+ which I know isn't even that long).The CM MM730 is such an underrated hidden gem that I would genuinely recommend to anyone who has a claw/palm-claw grip and who mainly aims with their wrists more than their arms.",
          "I'll use my Aerox 5, Glorious Model D, and Roccat Kone Pro for comparison with this mouse since they're all ultralight medium/large ergo mice. The mouse itself is a dream. Light as a feather, well-balanced, and one of the most comfortable shapes I've seen in an ergo mouse; it's noteworthy that it's medium sized for an ergo mouse: my hands are 19cm x 10cm and I use a half palm/half claw grip, it's the most comfortable mouse I've ever used! You could also run claw just fine or even fingertip if you have 20cm+ hands. The texture is smooth-matte and provides modest grip, the finish doesn't make my hands sweaty or leave residue on the mouse. It's amazing they've cut the weight down so much without resorting to drilling holes all over the thing, it's a gamechanger for ultralights IMO. It also comes with rubber 5 rubber grip stickers if you want more grip. The PTFE feet are great and and the smooth underside of the mouse drags less on my cloth pad than my other mice.The L/R buttons are quiter and easier to click than the average mouse while still being very crisp and having short travel. The optical microswitches have a 1ms response time which is just bonkers fast. There's no play in them at all. Middle mouse is easy to click with a soft and responsive feel, the scroll wheel is easy to roll with gentle tactile bumps, I love it. The side buttons could be a litle longer or thicker, they're recessed into the curve of the mouse so I found them slightly inconvenient to click. They're also louder and a bit squishier than L/R click. I'd prefer the DPI button be moved to the top of the mouse, there's room behind the scroll wheel.Hardware wise this is the best mouse I've ever used, it doesn't look flashy and lacks bells and whistles other \"gamer\" mice have because they're honestly mostly just gimmicks. Mouse shape, weight, size, texture, and button feel/responsiveness are the most important features of any mice by a long shot and everything else is just window dressing, every decent quality gaming mouse has a 1000hz polling rate and a good sensor with more DPI, IPS, & acceleration than you'll ever need. The RGB is lowkey with a few options to customize. It's a mouse that has no need to show off.Sadly, the software is total garbage. It's truly shocking how Coolermaster, a high-end brand, could make such an incredible piece of hardware and simultaneously make such a wildly incompetent software for it. The mouse jumps randomly and unpredictably between profiles when trying to switch on the fly, you can't rebind the left button at all which is just a baffling thing to choose not to include, and there's a combo feature where you hold middle mouse and click another button to fire a custom command but you can't rebind the combo button either. The software repeatedly deleted my saved macros. There's an incredibly feature-rich custom RBG light program maker, you can design your own lightshow and see how it works on your mouse as you're working on it... except you can't actually save the program and use them on the mouse, only for their keyboards, despite it working on the mouse. This astonishing piece of crap will also occupy nearly a full gigabyte on your harddrive! I've sincerely seen better software from bargain-bin Chinese crap mice. I need to be able to rebind my left mouse button and since it's literally impossible I'll sadly have to return this mouse, which is extraordinarily disappointing because otherwise this mouse seems to have been crafted by Hephaestus himself in his forge on Mount Olympus. Fix your crap, Coolermaster, this is absolutely shameful.",
          "Design is completely flawed with the side buttons getting jammed eventually and the scroll wheel will fail no matter what",
          "So my hand size is 18 cm x 9 and I haven't loved ergonomic mice besides EC2-B. EC2B has a lot of flaws too which I won't get into.This mouse has a PBT keycap coating which feels nice to hold, and the scroll wheel reminds me of the G403 scroll wheel, which is by far the best scroll wheel in the market.  The clicks are crisp and I can't feel any wobbling or side play in the buttons. Mouse button 4 is mushy while mouse button 5 is crisp. Regardless they both are placed in a nice spot and easy to reach with your thumb.SO overall Pros:-Amazing cable, USB c charging.-Crisp clicks, minus mouse button 4.- easy to glide and really lightweight.-Quality control doesn't seem to be an issue.- No lagging or spinout in game over 48 hours of gaming. Wireless works smoothly.Cons:The software doesn't seem to be the best, it's barebones like the EVGA software but it gets the job done for changing dpi.- Note if you don't update your firmware on your mouse the DPI will be off in the software included.Overall, I'm taking off 1 star for the software side of things, but the hardware provided is amazing. This will be my main switching from the GPW.",
          "Bought used for $30 and was cosmetically flawless.The mouse feels very comfortable with my 19x10cm hands and with it being a right ergo mouse it happened to fit me perfectly for a relaxed claw grip. The default skates are pretty decent, definitely better ones out there though. The default switches feel nice and spammable including the side buttons which are flatter than most. The weight makes this mouse feel nice to use in both gaming and office work so I recommend it. A single negative though is that updating the firmware is a MUST with this mice because before the update it was weirdly \"laggy\" but after the update it feels great."

          "Keyboard works amazingly, rgbs are bright, do think it's a bit on the loud side but it doesn't bother me at all. Would highly recommend",
          "This is my second mechanical keyboard (in the modern era, anyway) and it's a winner. While I miss the detachable cord from the other CM keyboard I purchased, the feel of this keyboard is just right for me. The low-profile red switches on the other keyboard were just a bit too soft, and I consistently double-tapped keys on the bottom row. This CK 550, however, always reproduces exactly what my fingers have typed. (Still doesn't prevent typos, unfortunately, but that's not a hardware problem.)The backlighting is nice \u2014 the keycaps are easily read in complete darkness, and I can set the color according to my mood. No software is needed to change the colors, so it's extremely Linux-friendly. I haven't tried any of the Linux software packages to drive a keyboard like this, so I can't comment on that. The built-in function-key support for media and screen brightness works without drivers in Linux.It's a bit noisier than my old reliable Saitek keyboard, but I could never read those keycaps in the dark, so the noise is bearable. Also, the included key puller allowed me to switch my modifier keycaps around to the configuration I actually use. I expect this could also remap the keyboard to AZERTY, Colemak, or Dvorak layouts (or any other Roman-based layout).All in all, I don't think I could be happier with a keyboard, and it's not nearly as expensive as many of the other mechanical options. I may someday try one with full-size reds to see if I like the quieter keys if they're not so short, but I don't feel the need to spend that money right now.",
          "I bought this as a replacement for my youngest kid as their gaming habits kinda wrecked more than one standard keyboard.  This has held up well over the first couple of months of use and is enjoyed very much.  When I asked for an opinion about it for writing this review, the response was, \"10 out of 5 stars.  Also, I love the sound it makes when I type.\"  I'll admit, it does have a satisfying report when the keys are pressed.We even bought a custom key for it from a third party just to add some flair.  If the enjoyment and performance level continue, it's possible the spousal unit will get one next.  :)",
          "Pro's:Solid construction, great typing feel (pick the right switch type for you!), good backlight shine thru the keycaps, wrist support is comfy and easily removed when wanted thanks to it's awesome magnetic attachment, multi-media keys are well placed, for shortcut loves having a windows key on both sides is great and rare on TKL's, don't need to use the software to configure it for basic stuff.Cons:The software for configuring the keyboard is trash.Overall:Love it. While I'm not a fan of gamer aesthetic keyboards, they're usually quality mechanicals without being ridiculously expensive so I deal with it. That game aesthetic is very lightly applied to this keyboard, it'd look great in a twitch stream or on a lawyer-trying-to-impress-high-end-clients desk. My only complaint is the janky software, but all I wanted to do was set a profile that was all white and not too bright, and one for all lights off, and I could do that on the keyboard itself without too much effort.",
          "I've used this keyboard for a week now. Of course the switches feel nice. There's four profiles where you can store your lighting configuration and macros. I was deeply impressed with the hardware based light configurations... there's several lighting effects to choose from, and you can control the background color, the foreground color of the effect, the effect's speed, brightness and a lot more. You can record and assign a macro to any key, and when the macro plays the keyboard will highlight the key that's being pressed with a red LED.The wrist rest feels very nice and it helps me type faster. It has a solid, compact design with thin strips of light on the sides of the board. Overall the quality is very high and I have high expectations for this keyboard going into the future.",

          "I own the older CoolerMaster Masterkeys Pro S RGB keyboard, very similar to this one. Sadly the LEDs on the old keyboard are not color matching anymore (I keep it lit up with a custom color layout) so I figured I'd upgrade to this new model.Lo and behold the new one is NOT Mac compatible. On the older model you could easily switch to a Mac compatible setup (the ctrl-alt-option keys primarily, but also the media keys for brightness, etc). This was extremely easy to do on the old model, but impossible on the new one. Also I can't get the esc key to stick to one color, it always defaults back to dark, but that's probably me doing something wrong. Oh and the built in snake game plays too fast on this keyboard compared to the old one. Yes, this keyboard has a built in snake game. It's awesome.But really, who makes a new product that does LESS than the old one? If the function was already there, why not just keep it in the product?It's a shame, really, because otherwise it feels nice, types nice and looks nice. I've had my old keyboard for a long time and type on it every day. It's a quality product and this one feels very similar. The magnetic wrist rest pad is great (magnets could be stronger for sure).So bottom line is if you are a Windows user I actually recommend this keyboard, but wow, what a lack of insight.",
          "First of all, I am not a gamer; I got the keyboard because the membrane-type keyboard I have been using (that came with my computer) has been getting flakey, and this one was on sale in one of the \"hot deal\" sites I follow. Based on the positive reviews and decent price ($49.99 with coupon), I decided to buy it.I like it very much! It's the first keyboard I've had in a very long time that has actual key switches. I like the illuminated keys, although I'm not really making full use of all the fancy lighting patterns that are available. It's taking me a little time to adjust to the keyboard since it has a lighter touch than my old keyboard. One thing I have noticed is that a key will sometimes actuate if I am just resting my fingers on the keys; you don't have to press down all the way for the key to register.There is only one thing about the keyboard that bugs me a little; the top row (numbers and symbols) has the shifted and unshifted legends reversed from what you would expect them to be. Take a look at the screen shots for the product and you will see what I mean. I don't know why they did this, but it is only distracting if I look at the keys when I'm typing. Normally I remember when I need to press shift for a particular symbol.",
          "I got this on sale for $60 and am happy with it.The RGB wasnt a selling feature for me, but its bright enough and the color range is pretty great. Ive had other RGB keyboards that oddly cant do proper purples (more pink than purple) or other mixed colors very well. Setting custom color profiles is not difficult, but like most other keyboard software, the interface isnt great.The Cherry MX Red switches are good and behave as advertised. No bad switches included. And the key caps are your standard double shot types.The build quality is mostly plastic, but has some good weight to it, and feels pretty solid. No creaking sound, and not much deck flex unless I really put a lot of pressure on it. I wasnt really trying to test how far that would go though.Over all, its a great basic keyboard for gaming, with nothing really special to make it stand out. But it will get the job done and should last a good long time if you take care of it.",
          "I'm unused to a keyboard that reads partial key presses which can be interesting when you suddenly start strafing in a game.  The overall feel of the keyboard is good, the key responses are positive and firm.It would be handy if the color management tool used a more standard API and was compatible with programs/games like Logitech's are.  It would also be nice if the keyboard colors could be set to fade to black when the computer's locked.I would suggest that if you're considering purchasing one of these, that you buy a wrist rest as well.  When I purchased this, I didn't purchase the wrist rest and I was having problems because I tend to rest my wrists on the keyboard stand while playing games, and that was leading to significant pain - this is a fairly tall keyboard.",
          "This is my first mechanical keyboard. And I ended up with it because it was on some consumer list for the best budget mechanical keyboard. I say this because I don't know how it stacks up to other mechanical keyboards, but I know I love this one.It just feels good to type on, and the sound is very satisfying. it's also nice to know that it's something durable that will last a while.I know it's a common thing for gamers to buy. I do game but it'll take more than a keyboard to make me any good so I can't speak to that except to say it's not giving me any problems there.Lastly is the LED functions. I'm not big on LED stuff usually. But this has some more subtle options that only trigger when typing, and I find I actually quite like it! And there's quite a few options, so probably it can do something that fits your aesthetic preferences, or you can just turn it off. I also like that it's controlled by keyboard combinations, instead of some piece of software.",
          "I've been using this keyboard for about a year now and I've really liked it overall.Pros:- Keypresses with the MX Brown variant are very satisfying.- Interesting lighting options. I'm using one where it's blue by default, but when you press a key it turns red and fades back to blue. I'm not usually impressed with RGB stuff but this one is very cool.- Still in perfect condition 1 year later- Easy to use key macro software. You have to download this from the Cooler Master website. It's simple and works.- Magnetic wrist rest is nice.Cons:???Highly recommend.",
          "This is my first mechanical keyboard. I got it with blue switches, and I gotta say, these keys are LOUD lol. While it doesn't bother me, it may bother those who are trying to sleep within my household. I haven't downloaded the software so I cannot say anything about it. Out of the box it the lights defaulted to a purple tint color and I liked it enough that I didn't care to change it.Build quality: It's not light but it's not heavy. The board itself feels nice; it has a smooth aluminum finish, and it looks amazing with the white keycaps. My only compaint would be that the keys are kind of tall. I would estimate that each key can travel half a centimeter before it touches the board. For competitive gaming this is likely not a good thing. I play a lot of valorant and halting movement completely is necessary to shoot accurately; having tall keys as such puts a slight delay on me fully releasing movement keys to come to a stop in-game (good thing counter strafing exists).Overall, it's a solid keyboard for my first. I've played many games, and wrote many essays and lab reports on this thing and it's going strong.Pros: looks good, feels good, works goodCons: possibly too loud, tall keys (too much travel distance)",
          "First off, you should know that I am an AVID gamer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast.  Over the past 5 years I have purchased at least half a dozen mechanical keyboards via amazon, microcenter and newegg, well known brands like Corsair, Cooler Master, Razer, and lesser know brands like AULA, Aukey, and Havit.  And that doesn't include the custom keycaps and other accessories that I have purchased.That being said I have not yet delved in to the rabbit hole that is custom mechanical keyboards... that's the next step, I think...ANYWAYS... When my son(15) asked for a mechanical keyboard I could tell that he had been doing his own \"research\" He wanted a keyboard with speed silver switches.  I was like um... no, for the most part unless you are an expert typist or a pro gamer you will absolutely not notice the difference between Cherry MX speed silvers and Cherry MX reds.  I had him play with a few of the keyboards I have lying around the house and also took him to our local microcenter and had him pound around on some of the displays they had set up... He could not tell the difference.I think for an entry level \"pretty\" gamer keyboard the Cooler Master CK552 is perfect.  It has Gateron Red switches, it's made by a reputable brand and has a perfect price point for the features and build.  RGB is a must for teenage boys (and adults who behave the same) and this one has easy to use RGB effects beyond just basic fading and color changing.  I was happy with the price, he was happy with everything else.7/15/2022: I was in my kid's room (now 17, lol) and noticed that the tops of his WASD keycaps were completely worn down to nothing. Just the translucent materal, no black at all. Got him some cheap replacement keycaps made of doubleshot ABS.  Easy fix, but for $70 I thought Cooler Master would have included better keycaps, not laser etched painted keycaps. Demoted to 4 stars",
          "For the last 2 years, I've been using a blue switch clickety-clack Razer  Black Widow. The noise was bugging my family and the keystrokes were tough. I never totally got used to them, and so my accuracy was down. I use the keyboard for writing mostly. After much research, I decided on the brown switch Cooler Master CK550 V2. The keyboard feel is easier and quieter than my Razer's, which for me is a good thing. I still get the typewriter effect without arthritis and the house-filling clacking. The Cooler Master has nice lighting choices with red, green, or blue to choose from and different brightness levels. I had to go to Cooler Master's YouTube page to totally figure out the system since the manual that comes with the keyboard is sparse, to be kind. Another problem with the incomplete manual is that I can't find out how to go to the end or beginning of a screen be it on the Internet, Google Docs, or Word. As I write this review, I have yet not found the navigation menu. So a start must be taken off.Update:CTRL End takes you to end of your document.CTRL Home takes you to top of your document.Arrow Down is Caps Lock.Cooler Master should have had a key in the manual.",
          "I loved this keyboard when I first bought it, and for around a year later. But I'm 14mo in and the spacebar has been inconsistent for a month or two now, and getting to the point where its almost a 50/50 chance of it working... Many others have mentioned various keys not working after some period of time, so I'm sure more will begin to fail as time goes on. Doesn't feel great that I originally spent ~$80on this keyboard, only for it to only work as expected for about a year. And of course it starts to fail right after the warranty runs out... Based on my experience, and that of others, I just can't really recommend this keyboard, especially for the price.",
          "I like pretty much everything about this laptop except for the very noticable coil whine. When this laptop breaks, I will be buying a different one for that reason alone.",
          "\u00a0I got the tenkeyless cherry MX brown version of this keyboard. I love the tactile bump of the keys, and I love the RGB lighting. While you don't need the software to reprogram the keyboard lights/keys/macros, I find the software to very easy and intuitive to use when compared to setting the lighting and macros on the keyboard, and it's a very light program free of any and all bloatware. There's many different options for creating RGB lighting effects, and the pictures and video I sent demonstrate my favorite RGB pattern: the cycle, where the color spectrum sort of revolves around the center of the keyboard.I'm not using the magnetic wrist rest that comes with the keyboard. I already had another wrist rest from another setup. I think the glorious PC gaming master race wrist pad is better then the wrist pad that was included here, because it's more comfortable, raises your wrists higher to the point where they are level with the keys (which helps reduce the chances of getting carpal tunnel), is bigger, and also doesn't cover up the really cool front facing LED on the keyboard.Now, you'll notice that the keycaps I'm using are also different. I think if you're really into the RGB colors of mechanical keyboards, you should consider replacing the ABS keycaps that come with this keyboard with acrylic double shot ABS keycaps. Those keys look super nice on a keyboard with cherry MX RGB lighting, as you can see in the pictures and video. The keycaps I'm using are red dragon A105 acrylic keycaps, which typically cost $10 to $15. Totally worth it for the aesthetics, and I personally like the super sleek and smooth feeling of those keycaps. It complements this keyboard really well.Initially, my only complaint was that they replaced the right click button on the right side of the keyboard with a 2nd windows button. This was annoying because I actually liked the right click key, and the button remapping software doesn't have the ability to reassign the 2nd windows button to a right click key: you can only assign it keys that already exist on the keyboard. However, shift + f10 is another way that you can right click with keyboards in general. So I used the software for this keyboard to assign the 2nd windows key to a macro: shift + f10. And I got my right click key back! ^_^",
          "Having had enough with the terrible Corsair software, I sold my K70 and moved to this tenkeyless board. I occasionally miss the other keys but the desk space and price is worth it. You're probably already fine with that if you're here though. Let me tell you that the Cooler Master software is a huge breath of fresh air and the materials on the keyboard will really surprise you. The K70 is considered the gold standard of RGB Gaming keyboards but I had heard that Cooler Master is giving them a run for their money and I 100% agree. The Wirecutter recommended this board and they were right, this thing is fantastic. The keys are surprisingly nice to the touch yet feel durable, and the wrist rest is also impressive. The K70 wrist rest was terrible! The only thing of note that I feel is lackluster is the LED lighting around the edge of the board. It's very dim and doesn't seem to stay evenly lit after customizing in the software. Hard to let that bother me when this board is $80-$100 cheaper than the very similar Massdrop Alt and Massdrop Ctrl I was considering.",
          "First off, I was only really used to blue and red switches. I am a big fan of having loud keyboards and being able to feel the keys. I was hesitant at getting a keyboard with brown switches but these are 100% great switches.The keys themselves feel really smooth and are great quality. The vibrancy of the backlit keys is also very nice.The only cons of this keyboard is that its more ideal if you have a stable table underneath otherwise you will shake it a lot (unless you are a slower typer) and the magnetic wrist pad could have a stronger pull. While its easy to move around however you like its also just too easy to detach it. But these cons don't ruin the keyboard enough for me to give it anything less then 5 stars.",
          "Need a beautiful, well made, budget friendly Gateron mechanical keyboard? You've found it.RGB controls are built in, no software needed. Brushed black matte metal is lovely to touch. Design is clean and stylish. No ugly logos. Clicks are bouncy and responsive. Noise is what you'd expect from Gateron Red keys, this is not a silent keyboard. I love the noise. Does not have on board sound control or any additional ports, I needed neither of these things. Corded, which was also not an issue for me. Excellent price, excellent quality, no bloatware. I use this for work and for gaming. Very pleased. If your needs are similar to mine, highly recommended.UPDATE: keyboard survived me accidentally dumping an entire cup of coffee on it, after pulling up the keys and cleaning with rubbing alcohol. impressed.",
          "TKL PerfectionI did not get money or freebies for writing this review.  This is not the first mechanical keyboard model I have used over the years, but it may become my last!I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve gone from the full keyboard layout with numpad to TKL.  Although I actually use a numpad fairly often, I find it much more convenient and ergonomical to have a separate numpad on the right side of my mouse.  Cherry Browns are the perfect switch for me and these are authentic Cherry Brown RGB switches, but this is not a review of the Cherry switch or the TKL layout:I am most thrilled with the on-board storage and CPU features of the keyboard.  There are 4 profiles you can customize.  ANY key can be remapped to another key or macro, so you can make use of any remaining redundant keys like \u2018End\u2019 or you could go wild and invent your own keyboard layout.  In my case, I remapped \u2018PGUP\u2019, \u2018PGDN\u2019, and \u2018PAUSE\u2019 to control the volume and add a mute/unmute key.  (FYI: when making a macro, you will need to \u201crecord\u201d key-presses, so if you want to map a key that doesn\u2019t exist on this board like \u2018Mute\u2019, you should also plug in a keyboard that has the key you need to record.)The amount of RGB customization is also extraordinary.  You can fine tune a large number of effects and those settings are also stored on the board.  The best part about having all of your settings stored in the keyboard\u2019s memory is that you can enjoy all of the benefits and features of the keyboard without any software (although the software makes the initial setup easier).  Once it\u2019s set up, you can plug the keyboard into any other computer or use any other operating system and your keyboard retains all macros, mappings, RGB settings, profiles, etc without the need of software.  Those of us using Linux distros should appreciate that \u2013 I surely do!The cable is detachable and uses a non proprietary cable, which means if the cable gets damaged or worn, you can just buy any USB-C cable.  The cable that is included is a well-made, durable, braided USB-C to \u201cregular\u201d USB-A.  The feet seem really sturdy and durable as well.Others have said the wrist rest is insufficient.  I actually like it, but to me this is an \u201cextra\u201d when buying a keyboard and is also a part that may need to be replaced a few times over the life of the board.  I\u2019ve been using the included wrist rest and honestly, it\u2019s better than some high-tier rests available stand-alone.I also appreciate CoolerMaster not making the board overly obnoxious with logos and branding.  The board is stunning enough for anyone who is into mechanical keyboards to initiate a conversation about it.",
          "The rubber feet are relatively smooth so this keyboard can slide if placed on a relatively smooth surface.  The wrist rest is excellent and has an almost leather-like feel.  Overall a good keyboard with good switches, although they are louder than I'd like.  The choice of colors and effects for key lighting is nice and I really appreciate being able to set the key lighting to 10 different brightness levels.It would be good for everyday typing for a straight, non-ergonomic keyboard.  (I've had ergo issues and tried a number of keyboard.)  In addition to gaming, It would make a good general-purpose keyboard except it is too loud to use if others are close by.",
          "Finally.  Like Goldilocks and the three bears: just right. Solid feel.  Sorta loud but not too much. Just feels good to use.  Oh. And it has pretty lights for those who look down while typing. I just keep mine on white\u2026.",
          "I have been taking my time in looking for a new keyboard, and I decided to stick to the Cooler Master family. I have used a Cooler Master Quickfire Pro since about 2013, and it still works perfectly to date, however I decided it was time to finally get a new keyboard (and Mouse).This keyboard is excellent to type on, has a noticeable key click, but its not *too* loud, since they are red switches. Blue switches are too loud in my opinion, especially when you are trying to talk to people through discord or something.The materials used feel premium. It has minimal deck flex when \"twisting\" the board at its sides, and none while pressing down on the middle of the board. The keys themselves feel nice to the touch. The space bar is a little \"hallow\" sounding, but it isn't too noticeable in day to day use.I am very pleased with this keyboard. I hope to use it for years to come.The software is excellent and easy to use. lots of customization and looks well put together.",
          "This is my first mechanical keyboard. I was in awe! The feeling when you type on it was so different then membrane keyboard. The tactile feel great. It kinda make you want to type faster and type more. And for gaming: is great also. It feel like I am playing better, \ud83d\ude05 Great RGB lighting, you have to experience in real life, it looks better than on pictures  The Build Quality is SUPERB. Only downside is it come with ABS plastic keycap, and only extra PBT keycaps for WASD, arrow and escape key. But still it feel great. If you are looking for your first mechanical keyboard, this is a good one. You will be satisfied with the experience and quality. 10/10",
          "I always hear that on this version the keys are a downgrade from the previous version's supplier. But this item is very good quality. I'd have to say it is one of the best mechanical keyboards I have owned. The LEDs are amazing quality and the only con I can notice, is at times, if you look, very close, you will notice some of the LED lit letters will display a slight, almost missable, plastic that obscures a very, very small fraction of the light. Thats it.  Really recommend.",
          "This keyboard is the absolute smallest it can be while retaining the TKL form factor, but it still manages to fit in a ton of features. The LEDs are bright and colorful with plenty of effects available, the USB-C routing channel is convenient, and you can play Snake on it! But don't leave the keyboard cycling between effects while playing games because it will inevitably decide that it's time for a game of Snake and your arrow keys will stop working until the mode switches again.Anyway, the squishy leathery wrist rest is nice but I don't use it because it kinda defeats the point of being super compact. The board's feet are a little steep but that's fine. The keycap layout is standard, which is really nice coming from a Corsair. I now have the option to buy custom keycaps in the future.There are a couple of minor issues with this board though, most notably that the cable routing channel doesn't hold the cable when the feet are deployed. The RGB control is sophisticated, but also finicky. And if you turn the keyboard on its side, the flat metal surface means any accumulated debris will spill out instead of staying put until you actually clean it.Overall I would say that this is definitely a good purchase, especially as your first mechanical keyboard.",
          "I am not an avid gamer, but I am an author. So I use my keyboard a lot.I was nervous buying a more affordable version because some of the reviews were harsh. But all in all I am extremely happy with this keyboard. The keys feel great, it's louder than I expected, but I've gotten used to the tap noise.It was so easy to set up and adjust the colors, the website was helpful in getting the software set up. I am tech illiterate in most cases, but I found set up to be a breeze. The colors are bright, but not in a distracting manner. They are completely customizable, which was great because some colors are brighter than others.If you are looking for a starter mechanical keyboard, this is a great option.",
          "Software is a little kludgy, for example: can't use the tab key to move between fields, but it gave me the exact colors on the keys that make me productive. The keyboard itself: easy to type quickly on.",
          "Great Keyboard for the price. RGB works well, and is versatile, and works without issue for general productivity and gaming. I only wish it had dedicated media controls.I will add, this product does not have a metal front plate, rather features a fully plastic construction. Not a big deal, just to be kept in mind before buying.",
          "Oooh, it has gateron switches! So what?! I did give it 2 stars because the key switches feel really nice and that's the ONLY good thing about it. The keys are slightly too small for my taste, Some people claimed it had bigger keys and since I have motor issues I was glad to see that. Not even close to the truth. That I can get used to. What I can't get used to are the glitches in the software and the persisted bugs in the hardware itself!If you lock the keyboard (which I have to do a lot) with the Function F9 combo, DO NOT hit any other function combo or Function F9 will stop working altogether and you'll have to unplug the keyboard to be able to unlock it again. But then you lose all of the customizations you've set which is normal for some programmable keyboards, but here's where CM's brain cells quit working:To choose a profile, you CANNOT just choose it, you have to click \"import\", navigate to where the profiles are stored in explorer, then open that. Sometimes not even that works! What is the point of showing 5 profiles if clicking any of them does NOTHING but open up your file browser where the profile are stored? And get this, I restored defaults on one profile and suddenly ALL of my profiles were reset even though I hadn't reset them (they were all copies of my preferred profile). I had to keep unplugging the keyboard, \"switching\" profiles over and over before the other profiles became available again.After a month I noticed that randomly and with RAPIDLY increasing frequency, every key I'd press kept repeating when I typed. I couldn't even type this review on this keyboard! And it often backspaces over whole sentences I've written. It JUST NOW erased 3 whole lines I'd just typed!!!!! I kept thinking it was a Windows 10 issue, but it does NOT affect other keyboards. This happens in browsers and in word processors, so it's not the system. I plugged in another keyboard and this issue did not exist. I then plugged them both in at the same time and only the CM keyboard had this behavior. Even after fully uninstalling the CM software the issue persists, meaning that the hardware itself is total garbage!Coolermaster was glad to do an RMA though I had to pay for shipping. Took about a week to get it back, so good on them. BTW I didn't know this at the time and ended up paying over $20 to ship it back. But anything electronic or digital can be shipped for only $12! You just have to make sure the shipper chooses the electronic option when choosing how to ship this.I've had other Cooler Master products and none of them lived up to the hype either. My $15 Kolomax keyboards have lasted a long time and are much more comfortable to type and play games on. Too bad so many sellers are price-gouging on it now (supply chain is not an issue with this keyboard). It doesn't have macros or light up individual keys but it WORKS flawlessly. I will never invest in an expensive and WAY overpriced keyboard ever again.",
          "I've used a similar version of this keyboard, the CK552, for a while at my work desk, so when I decided to move away from Logitech G, I immediately looked for this. Part of it is the fact that it doesn't need software for you to get some pretty solid color options, and the other part is even after a couple of years, the CK552 still held up very well. The other big reason is purely aesthetics: Logitech uses a non-standard layout for its keys, which makes using custom keycaps difficult. I've grown very fond of pudding keycaps, and the fact that I couldn't use the spacebar replacement was frustrating. The CK552 used a standard layout, so I figured this one would too, and it does. So if you're a fan of switching out keycaps, this keycap is great for that. The LED's are also significantly brighter than on any of the Logitech keyboards I've used, so if RGB lighting matters, this keyboard is vivid.For this keyboard, the CK550 V2, I decided to give brown switches a try for the first time. I had previously used Logitech's Romer-G switch, blue switches, and red switches (on the CK552), and I have to say, I enjoy the brown switches a lot. Not as loud as blues, but still with that bump that helps me when I type (I have issues with red switches because there's no resistance). However, this keyboard comes in red and blue switches if those are your jam.Feel of the keyboard is great. There's very little flex to it and the brushed finish looks very nice. There are no extra buttons or keys, so if you like media controls or macro keys, you're out of luck here. Media controls are mapped to other keys that can be accessed with the function keys, but nothing is dedicated. The keyboard did come with a wrist rest. It isn't anything special, but will do the trick if you have nothing else to use. I personally prefer the one that came with the Logitech G513 Carbon.The lighting can be controlled either software from Cooler Master, or via the Function button and some of the function keys. For instance, you can change the amount of red, green, and blue color by holding the Function key and pressing F2, F3, or F4 respectively. There are 9 levels of brightness for each color, which allows for an expansive amount of colors. There are different color modes as well if basic colors aren't your thing. The ability to not rely on software is nice, although I'm sure the software allows for more expansive, custom options. I've chosen not to even bother with it as I've not read good things about it and I like to limit how much RGB software is installed at any given time. The big reason for choosing this family of keyboards in the first place was the ability to keep it simple as RGB software in general can be prone to issues.Overall, I'm happy with the keyboard. If it holds up anywhere near as well as the CK552, I should be pretty happy for a long time. I've not noticed anything negative worth noting. All the keys work as expected and the lighting still looks as good as it did the day I opened it up. If you're looking for a solid keyboard that doesn't need software to operate, this is a good place to start.",
          "Very nice keyboard with good build quality, but I returned it after a few days because of some niche issues I experienced.PROS:- Aluminum base is great and feels sturdy.- Has a nice feel when typing.- Red switches are relatively quiet for a mechanical keyboard.CONS:- Native RGB controls leave something to be desired compared to similar keyboards.- Plugging into a laptop docking station caused issues with other device connectivity.- USB connector is built-in, so it can\u2019t be replaced if it breaks.",
          "Had this keyboard for less then a year. The A key started to not register then finally snapped out of it. Then had the same problem with the W key and today it is the V key. Not sure why the problem goes away after some time but it's a huge inconvenience. Love the keyboard but this problem sucks. Time for something new.",
          "Had this for a little over a year and honestly, I was surprised on how well it worked. That was, until my W key started going. Doesn't matter what I tried to get it fixed, it wouldn't get any better. The sensitivity was lost and only smashing and holding it tight would make it recognize the pressing. Had it lasted 2 years I'd probably buy a new one and try again, but I'll be going with a different brand instead.",
          "Don't get me wrong, the keyboard *functions*. But now some of the keys - Insert, Delete, End, and the Up, Down, and Left arrow keys - all constantly have a very, very faint green tinge. The LED for each of these keys is stuck at having the Green setting at the very lowest setting all the time, regardless of whether or not I have it on for the rest of the keys. It's barely noticeable when any of my other settings are on, but I often prefer to leave the LEDs off, and this is an unavoidable distraction. I am considering getting a replacement for this one, if I do and it turns out to be a rare bug, I'll update my review.8/15/22 EDIT: Checked it the next day and for some reason those particular keys are no longer displaying green on the RGB at all times. No explanation. I'm leaving my review at three stars because I did nothing between the problem being there and going away, meaning that it's still potentially a problem.",
          "I'll certainly update this as I've had it longer and if my opinion changes, but so far this is a great keyboard. Very happy I went with this over some of the much higher price plastic keyboards. I like the look, and there isn't a giant logo sticker I have to look at. The app used to control the RGB is easy and intuitive. I literally can't think of any changes I'd like. SUCH a huge improvement over the cheapo keyboard I was using before, and wished I'd have pulled the trigger sooner.Update: took this down by 1-star simply due to the fact that Cooler Master has not honored my rebate, nor responded to my inquiries about it. They say 6-8 weeks and I'm at the end of that time frame. I'll continue to wait, and will update this if they make good on the offer. The amount of hoops they want you to jump through, and specifics in the way they request you submit the rebate makes it pretty obvious they don't want you to claim it.",
          "Can\u2019t recommend this enough.",
          "I have had the keyboard for about 2 weeks now and I love the way it feels. The wrist pad that came with it is great as well. I generally just throw the plastic wrist guards away immediately but this one isn\u2019t plastic and feels great.Not much more to say other than it\u2019s been worth the money these 2 weeks",
          "I bought this CM board about 7 months ago now. At the time I was going stir crazy during the C19 lockdowns and was on a quest for the perfect TKL board for me haha. I tried boards with all sorts of switches, sizes, features, etc...This one ended up being the winner! The brown switches are a perfect hybrid. Crispy typing without overbearing noise. It's proven to be durable and reliable as well. I play quite a few games and have logged a ton of hours with it and this board has yet to fail me.I would recommend getting a set of keycaps as the ones that came with it got gunky pretty quick on me. I ended up using the G-Skill keycaps and highly recommend them (attached pic).Besides that I would also encourage you to keep the quick reference guide. The software is kind of a pain to use but honestly you don't need it so long as you use the guide and learn the shortcuts. Media player, LED mode, brightness, etc... can all be done with no software.GJ Cooler Master!",
          "I owned the previous version of this CK530 in the Cherry MX Red variant and have been waiting for them to release one with brown switches. The board feels great, has a good layout, and they made some small improvements over the previous version too, like fixing the spacebar rattling. Overall a great price and solid keyboard, I've owned many mechanical keyboards and this one is one of my favorites in terms of features and value.",
          "It's a good keyboard. I'm not amazed by the MX Cherry Brown switches, as they're a little scratchy and almost imperceptibly tactile, but that's not the keyboard's fault.My (very very minor) complaint is with the keycaps. I bought the TKL version, and on the number keys (the second row from the top), the number is printed at the top of key and and symbol (that you get with the shift key) is at the bottom. This is HERESY! In every keyboard I've seen in the last 30 years (like the Logi in my pic), the default key (which you get without hitting shift) is at the bottom. In fact, on this keyboard, some the other keys are printed that way - for example, the \"? /\" key has the slash (correctly) at the bottom. It's just some keys that are backwards. It's not the end of the world, but if I look at the keyboard when I type, I hit a function key (first row) because my brain thinks I should hit the space above the number key when hunting for a $, or @, or ^, etc.Luckily, you can replace the keycaps, and that's my plan. I'm very happy with my choice overall.",
          "This keyboard worked great for 10 months, but just started having issues with the 'a' key. I play a decent amount of video games, which may have led to the issue.",
          "Despite being considered a \"budget\" keyboard during my research this keyboard is very well made and feels great. Love that you can use most of the features and adjust the lighting without the need for any special software. I would highly recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a reasonably price mechanical keyboard. I just want to mention two things you should keep in mind if you are considering this keyboard. First is noise, despite not being a \"clicky\" keyboard it is far from quiet. It is noticeably louder than a traditional membrane keyboard. The noise doesn't come from the switches in the keys but rather the keys hitting the bottom of their travel. If you are gentle or just lightly tap the keys you can avoid this. But since the keys offer little resistance, unless you are REALLY trying to avoid the keys bottoming out, they will. I actually have grown accustomed to it and found myself not minding the noise at all despite being rather easily annoyed by noises. The second thing to consider is that, as mentioned in the last point, the keys are VERY sensitive and offer basically no resistance. Even slightly depressing a key by resting you finger on it can cause it to register a press. For some this maybe a problem but once I got used to it, it hasn't caused any issues.",
          "I've spent the last several years typing on cheap keyboards, and figured I'd try one with mechanical switches.  My PC is used for both coding and gaming, and I don't really use the keypad, so I went with a TKL keyboard with Brown switches.  I don't particularly want or need an RGB light show, but that's generally how they come these days unless you want one of the \"artisanal\" keyboards.So far I'm liking the feel of the mechanical switches, and I like having my mouse a few inches closer in.  Somewhat underwhelmed by the CoolerMaster MK730 though.In terms of hardware, it has a solid feel, but is a little louder than I expected.  The switches aren't the clicky variety, but it's fairly loud when they bottom out.  I could probably fix this with a bunch of O-rings, but it's not especially bothersome.  The spacebar developed a bit of a squeak almost immediately.  Not sure what the fix for that is, but the open layout should make it easier to apply a drop of squeak-b-gone somewhere.  (It's also irritating my thumbs a little for some reason.)  There are no lights for Caps Lock or Scroll Lock, though you can configure the per-key coloration to reflect the current state.  I like the wrist rest.The documentation is essentially non-existent.  There's a quick-reference card that says things like \"FN + F6 = Lighting Foreground effect\" with no explanation of what that means.  The 15MB PDF that you can download from their web site is just a scan of the quick-ref sheet.  There are some youtube videos you can sit through that demonstrate what they do.The software isn't bad.  I haven't found a need for macros so I won't comment on the keyboard's macro capabilities.  There are some odd mis-steps in the configuration system though.  I didn't really want my keyboard to show a fireworks display while I was typing, but you can barely read the keycaps if the lighting is off, so I selected the \"static\" profile, which sets all the keys to a single color.  The problem with this is that the Caps Lock lighting no longer reflects the current state of the key -- it changes briefly when you hit the key, then reverts to the static lighting.  This is fine on a keyboard with a dedicated caps lock light, but really dumb here.  (Solution: select the \"custom\" profile, and then drag-select the entire keyboard to set all the keys to the same thing.  When done this way, Caps Lock remains dim when not enabled.)The box came with purple keycaps that you can place on WASD and the arrow keys.  This is a little silly for a keyboard with per-key lighting, but I guess if you're a huge fan of Cooler Master you can show their corporate colors even when the keyboard is off.So... not bad, not great.  It's okay.Update 2020/01/20: after 15 months of daily use, the 'C' key has developed an intermittent stutter.  (For example, it actually typed 'CCC' just now.)  That's not nearly long enough for a key to wear out, especially for a less-popular letter.  -1 star.FWIW, the squeaky spacebar fixed itself.",
          "A very solid keyboard I\u2019m not a fun of using wrist rests. So it could be a bit higher for those use it without a wrist rest. But overall it\u2019s a very good keyboard for gaming and typing. The one I\u2019m using is with cherry mx brown switches, and I did a comparison that the cherry mx rgb brown switches are a bit smoother than cherry mx brown. If u like cherry switches go with cooler master! I have used more than 5 mechanical keyboard before, Corsair/ducky/durgod/leopold/razer trust me cooler master has the best quality control and the rgb might not be the best but it\u2019s enough for me. More importantly the feel of each key is 99% the same and in general it feels way better than Corsair  and durgod and razer. Leopold doesn\u2019t have rgb. So as a summary this is so far the best experience I\u2019ve had using a cherry mx brown switch keyboard.",
          "I've been using a membrane keyboard since 2011 (Sidewinder x4) because every mechanical keyboard I've used has felt like cheap crap. The combination of a solid aluminum top plate and the Gateron reds is a really nice alternative. I first tried out these switches on a friend's GMMK, but since the full size was out of stock, I bought this instead - and I feel the user experience is similar enough that I don't want the GMMK anymore.The reds aren't tactile, they are linear - so no weird click when you press them. They do \"clack\" a bit, but this is just from the keycap bottoming out on the switch. This can be mitigated with an O-ring kit, which I ordered to decrease the level of noise a bit, but haven't gotten yet.The lack of dedicated media control buttons was a bit odd, but there's an FN key combination for everything.The only thing I DON'T like is that the actuation force required for the reds is so minimal that I tend to accidentally strafe while gaming, but this is just an acclimation thing - I'm used to smashing a membrane into a PCB. I imagine it'll become more intuitive with time.",
          "The cherry brown switches and general build quality is good. Wrist wrest is useless but that's not a big deal. Its a great size and feel for coding and gaming. The included PBT caps for the WASD add a nice flair. It is easy to modify the lighting without using an app. USB C is fantastic, not so much for performance than for connector reliability and ease of use. The cord channels are improved over the previous CM TKL keyboard.Unfortunately there is one critical flaw, for me, that causes me to regret buying this.The switches only light the top of the key because of the placement of the LED at the top of the cherry switch. CM decided to reverse the number keys so the number is on top and would be lit. They still perform as normal but I naturally hit the shift key constantly. A better design for the numbers would be to have a large number to the left and a smaller symbol to the right slightly smaller. Or, reverse the switch itself so the number can be on the bottom as usual.The other two symbol keys suffer from the lighting issue but are at least correctly oriented. With most two symbol keys it is almost impossible to see the lower symbol in a dim room.I have replaced the numbers from the previous CM TKL keyboard (not lit) this is replacing and soldiering on but this has not been as satisfying a keyboard as I had expected.",
          "This keyboard is very well made and sturdy. It has no flex and a good heft to it. I switched from blue switches to red and at first, I missed the tactile bump, but after gaming and typing with this keyboard for a while now, I can say that I prefer these red switches better for gaming and typing and they are much quieter as well.  The only negative I have against this keyboard at this time is that the black brushed aluminum collects dust and becomes quite noticeable with the LED lighting. This, however, is not exclusive to this keyboard but to all black brushed aluminum keyboards. Otherwise, great keyboard especially, since I got mines in special at $55."

          "If you tend to disconnect/reconnect your coiled cables frequently (such as when using a keyboard in multiple locations), there's a good chance the keyboard won't successfully reconnect and you'll have to keep repeatedly plugging in the connectors before the keyboard is finally connected. I intend to return for this reason.",
          "I bought a CK720 with brown switches. For a keyboard that claims to be for enthusiasts, there's a terrible pitfall: the right Shift key has an irregular size of U1.5, which makes virtually all keycap sets incompatible with this keyboard AND the original Keycaps are too ugly and horrible to read secondary functions as well as confusing Windows users with Mac OS functions and vice versa.There is no 2nd.  layer of programmable functions and macros without the main function of each key being unusable and the existing secondary functions are not remappable and the worst part of this is that the placement of these secondary functions are positioned in confusing and undeducible places and there are redundant functions such as control of volume and media.  The possibility of recording multiple profiles is disposable, almost useless.  Controlling RGB via software is confusing and extremely labor intensive if you want anything beyond the pre-programmed settings.",
          "I\u2019m not a huge keyboard enthusiast but I\u2019ve owned my fair share of keyboards, especially mechanical ones. After my girlfriend took my K65 for herself, I decided to shop around. I own a Cooler Master MH650 so thought I\u2019d see what they had to offer. There is virtually no wobble with the keys and the stabs come really lubed up. I got blue switches, my favorite, but they offer red and browns if you want linear and tactile without the loud click. I like the click to get back and annoy my girlfriend while I\u2019m gaming for retribution for commandeering my other board but I digress\u2026The knob is great. Easily programmable and makes a difference with how you use your board. I don\u2019t think I can ever go back to a board without one after just using it for a day.The top plate is easily removable and it\u2019s a cool little feature. Like seriously easy. Remove just some keycaps on the right side and pop a switch where the dongle is located and it pops right off. No screwing required. It\u2019ll make cleaning easier after a few months. Sure, it\u2019s kinda gimmicky, but in the future CM is apparently looking to offer different top plates for customization so I\u2019m looking forward to what that\u2019s gonna look like.All in all pretty satisfied and I\u2019ll definitely keep an eye out for other CM offerings in the future.",
          "These is a top notch keyboard. The keys are super responsive with perfect placement. It is comfortable and has helped tremendously with my carpal tunnel! It looks as nice and it works and I can\u2019t think of a single complaint! Highly recommend!",
          "The keyboard is honestly pretty bad for the price point of $130. The keys are weirdly slanted upwards, making it hard to transition your fingers from key to key. Also, the keys feel sticky. They don't feel easy to hit without hitting another key accidentally. The response time feels somewhat slow to me. The $35 keyboard I previously owned felt and was a lot better for gaming than this red switch keyboard. I don't recommend this product for the price.",
          "GREAT INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND I LOVE THE MARKINGS ARE ALL FULLY LIT WITH RGB BUT AS I USED IT I DISCOVERED IT HAS MANY FLAWS.  FIRST OFF IT ISN'T FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH MAC AND IN 2022 THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR ANY COMPANY TO BASICALLY NOT ALLOW 50% OF THE FUNCTIONS NOT BE ACCESSED BY PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS.  ITS JUST STUPID.  SO WITHOUT SOFTWARE TO CONTROL THE KEYBOARD YOU CAN ONLY TRY TO TRIAL AND ERROR YOUR KEYSTROKES THROUGH THE HIEROGLYPHIC MARKINGS AND WHAT THEY DO AND PRAY WHETHER THE ON BOARD MEMORY WILL ACCEPT AND KEEP YOUR INPUTS.  *SPOILER- IT WONT.  SO WITH THAT, A GOOD LOOKING KEYBOARD STARTS TO FALTER AS ONE FUNCTION AFTER ANOTHER EITHER GOES AWAY OR STOPS WORKING ALL TOGETHER NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN ( THE DIAL STOPPED CONTROLLING VOLUME AND NO MATTER WHAT I DID WOULD JUST CONTROL BRIGHTNESS OF RGB) AND THAT'S JUST DISAPPOINTING.  GREAT BUILD. SEEMS SOLID AND LOOKS DAMN GOOD. BUT IN FUNCTION AND EXECUTION OF THIS INDUSTRIAL INSPIRED KEYBOARD COOLER MASTER FALLS PLAINLY FLAT.  SO SAVE UP YOUR COINS AND GO FOR THE OPTION YOU KNOW YOU REALLY WANT AND BUY THE LOGITECH G915TKL. YES, I AGREE ITS PRICEY BUT THAT'S CUZ LOGI. KNOWS WHAT THEY CREATED IS LEGIT AND STANDS SOLO IN A SEA OF REDUCTIVE COPIES",
          "I really liked this keyboard for the features it offered. Having wired, USB, and Bluetooth as options for connecting devices is stellar, and the dial on the keyboard gave the keyboard a unique feel. The tactile keys weren't amazing, but I think I could have gotten used to them. The lighting under the keycaps was appealing to add to the pros.What I didn't love was the materials used. Using so much plastic gave it a very cheap feel. Comparing the board to my Keychron K6 made me feel like I got a toy rather than a keyboard I could use long-term. I'm not a keyboard connoisseur, but this one didn't speak to me and I ended up returning it.",
          "\u00a0Originally aiming for the white/ silver one, but decided to get the 30th anniversary version one. Why you may ask?1. It came with PBT caps already, compared to the originals.2. It came with a coiled connector.3. The color was pretty convincing.I was hesitant with what the negative reviews stated. Since the 30th ann. version was a bit of an upgrade, I caved. LolSo far, it has been a bit over a month in use. I have tested both wired, Bluetooth, and wireless. All works great between daily use and gaming. I haven\u2019t had an issue with it at all.To me, this is a pretty solid board if you are not all about the hot swappable keys. The RGB is super bright and I find the pre-install settings are more than enough. This means no additional program needs to be downloaded. If you want to do more customization, it\u2019s needed.This keyboard saved me so much space and I love it. I cannot wait for them to come out with more accessories for it.Plus, the sound is pretty smooth and quiet to me (compared to my old one). Of course it could be better, but I\u2019m fine with it.A few cons are the wrist pad and space bar. The wrist pad should of been more of a slope for better comfort. I also believe the space bar needs more lube or a different stabilizer.I decided to switch out the black PBT key caps that came with it to white ones I already had.Is it pricey? Not really. Maybe the original colors of grey and silver, but 30th ann. is worth every penny.",
          "It works the best out of all the keyboards I bought.",
          "Nothing super exciting. Thought it would feel a little more sturdy. Kind of cheap feeling. Pay an extra $60 and get something high quality.",
          "This is my first smaller keyboard and I really like it. The main stuff works without installing software which is nice if you don't want to install more stuff. All the functions work with button presses so you'll need a cheat sheet for a while. The clicky switch version is very clicky but you can swap them out if they are too loud for you( sold separately).",
          "I've been a Cooler Master customer for quite some time now. I've owned a number of their products, from cases to case fans and to CPU coolers. They have been selling keyboards for a while now and I've been eyeing some of their options. With the recent release of the CK721, I finally jumped on the mechanical keyboard train. This keyboard is pretty awesome. It's small, compact, and has 3 different connection options, wired, bluetooth, and USB. There's also a number of cool lighting effects, even per-key LED programmability, all of which can be controlled through their MasterPlus+ software. If you're in the market for a small compact mechanical keyboard, I think this is a perfect option.",
          "I'm not sure why exactly. It sounds a little over the top. Never thought I'd think of a keyboard as elegant, but elegant this is. That's the one word that just popped out when I started playing with it.Individually it's honestly nothing special. It's mechanical like all the other popular boards out there. It has a dial where a bunch of other keyboards have dials too. It's wireless with bluetooth and 2.4ghz (nice touch), but other keyboards have that as well. Even price wise it's not like it's a steal or anything.Just 100% it's the sum of its parts and how it's put together that makes me feel like this is the best keyboard I've ever used, hands down. I'm looking forward to adding some mileage to this baby.",

          "A lot of the reviews on the CK720 page are for the CK721, so here's an actual CK720 (Kailh V2 Reds) review:It's a BANGER, Y'ALL. Incredible enthusiast value for $100. Here's why:- 3- and 5-pin switch support. Corsair also does a hotswap keyboard, it's wireless even. But it costs $150 and supports 3-pin only (you could use 5-pin switches, but you'd have to clip the extra legs). Razer's hotswap options are limited to Razer's proprietary switches only.- Pre-lubed switches. YES. PRE-LUBED. Well, it's a pretty light application, and the switches are still very slightly scratchy. But they're perfectly fine out of the box. You can only hear the scratch if you pull the switch out and press it while holding it close to your face. If I had to, I'd call it more of a \"clack\", not a \"thock\" (pretty sure the plate is the culprit, not the switch).- The stabilizers are extremely well tuned out of the box. There's virtually zero spacebar rattle if you lightly tap your finger along the spacebar. The same can't be said of my Keychron V4. Also the stem housings are pretty tight for a plate-mounted stabilizer? Heckin' wow. Very amaze.- Stock keycaps are doubleshot shine-through PBT. It's not the thickest PBT, but that's the cost of shin-through. What's important is that it's PBT, so it won't collect finger oils as quickly as ABS.- Silicone plate AND case dampeners! These take the a lot of the sting out of the steel plate AND add a good bit of heft to a pretty plastic-y case. (The aluminum top frame is fine. It's pretty stiff, but it's not hard to flex either.)- I guess north-facing-epic-gamer-programmable-per-key-RGB-with-accompanying-software is cool too. I usually turn my backlights off.- Combo keycap/switch puller! Heck yeah! A lot of cheap keyboards will send a cheap finger keycap and/or switch puller. Y'all know the ones - those tiny circular pieces of plastic or thin af aluminum. Not with the CK720.Well...I do have 2 nitpicks- steel plate. This can't be helped. Steel plates are standard for keebs $100 and under.- my spacebar is warped. Yours might not be, but warping on the larger keys is pretty common for cheap keycaps. Again..can't complain on a $100 prebuilt.I was going to swap keycaps and switches, but honestly, I think I just might leave this stock...I'm very impressed.",

          "I purchased the SK653 with white/silver finish and brown switches for using with my MacBook Pro at the office. Unfortunately this keyboard is nearly unusable for me. I intended to use it in wireless mode to replace my full sized apple magic keyboard, but the wireless function is beyond unreliable. The Bluetooth connection quickly degrades after pairing until it's so laggy typing is impossible. This is with my MacBook less than 12 inches away from the keyboard. Switching to wired mouse solves the lag issue, but introduces another crazy problem with certain keys double-typing (e.g. K, I, B, numpad 5 & 0 as well as a few other keys). I do a lot of data entry, so double typed numbers are a major problem.These kinds of problems in a keyboard are totally unacceptable in any use scenario. How can this even be an issue? Keyboards have existed almost from the dawn of computing, and if apple can get Bluetooth to work properly from a solid aluminum body keyboard, so can everyone else. Cooler Master should be ashamed of themselves for passing this piece of garbage off as a professional mechanical keyboard. 100% total fail.Sadly I cannot return the keyboard because I'm out of the country of purchase, so I'll try to put it on the second hand market.

I appreciate the per-key lighting capability, the ability to customize the keyboard's lighting without dedicated software, and the clicky feedback from the blue switches. The aluminum deck gives the keyboard a professional finish and the profile storage allows for quick and easily identifiable device switching. A couple gripes we've encountered...

          "I've had this keyboard for more than a year now so I can safely say the following review is not at all as a result of me just not giving it a chance or not having had time to get used to it or anything of the kind.Now with that out of the way,THIS IS THE WORST PILE OF GARBAGE KEYBOARD I HAVE EVER OWNED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.This keyboard is complete TRASH. Where to begin, there's just SO many things wrong with this keyboard it's hard to even put it into words. For starters, the keyboard does not work at all until after your OS boots and bluetooth drivers load. The keyboard connects via bluetooth so you CAN NOT use it for anything pre-boot. Need to get into BIOS? TOUGH LUCK SCRUB. Your PC will not register your key presses prior to your OS loading up. Also I'm sure I know what you're thinking. \"You have the option to connect via USB as well...\" THAT ALSO DOESN'T WORK! It doesn't matter if you're connected wirelessly or via USB. It will NOT work at all until your OS is completely booted. Making this keyboard worthless just for that alone. What a joke. Even my cheap $10 logitech keyboard I've had for over a decade works flawless to this day. Thankfully I have it so I can get into bios as a backup when I need to.Next up, the \"features\" this keyboard comes with. They're AWFUL. Coolermaster just loaded it up with TONS of worthless features that no one needs which GET IN YOUR WAY ALL THE TIME!!! And It has mac and windows mode? Are you STUPID!? If I wanted a mac keyboard I'd get one. This is absurd. You have no idea how many times I accidentally switch to mac mode without even realizing it because of the stupid keyboard combinations that you use to control EVERYTHING. Then I wonder why nothing is working anymore and of course it's because I'm in OSX mode. UGH.And on the topic of keyboard combinations, there are SO MANY combinations!!! It's impossible to remember them all! But what happens if you press a combination by accident or your cat walks on your keyboard or whatever and all of a sudden everything's messed up? Well good luck getting it back to how you want it because of how many keyboard combinations there are that aren't clear at all on how to use them. And you wanna look up what they all are? Good luck with that too because cooler master's on product support page is worthless and doesn't have documentation on it at all!!!!!!And if that's not bad enough the software is completely worthless too. Just overall complete trash. I would regret getting this keyboard even if I'd gotten it for free. But I had to pay over $160 for it. Almost two hundred dollars for a keyboard that makes me wish I was on literally anything else every single day.What a shame because the actual mechanics of this keyboard are actually good. It's nice and simple (the layout) the keys feel good, the build quality is solid and the backlight is VERY good. But everything above just completely invalidates an otherwise solidly built keyboard. Just goes to show some people just can't help themselves. They over complicate something as simple as a keyboard and end up releasing a steaming pile of garbage.DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD. STAY AWAY!!!!",
          "This keyboard is amazing. Took me only a couple of days to get used to the smaller right shift but having the arrow keys is incredible. Don\u2019t skip installing the software in addition to the color settings it updates the firmware.",
          "Loving the slim design, color (white), and it\u2019s linear slim switches.",
          "I have had it for two weeks and it works like a charm. I am coming from a Razer wireless that could not hold a charge for more than 1 day. I have been running this keyboard on day 12 without a charge and still have 40% battery. Quality is great and comes with a lot of RGB settings. I do wish it had an app to change backlighting as opposed to just keyboard commands. Moreover, I wish white was a color option for times when I do not feel like other colors. Overall very happy!",
          "I upgraded to this model from the SK650 RED switches. I really love this 653, I'm still getting used to the brown click switches but this keyboard is very responsive and feels more accurate than the previous model. I hardly ever have any mistypes. The RGB is done well, keycaps feel quality. . and one of my favorite parts about this and the previous model is the aluminum back plate. Of course the addition of having raised legs, and WIRELESS is really nice. I might not ever use the wireless feature but still cool either way. Software is a nice upgrade too. IF you are looking for a nice compact but still full size keyboard this is the way to go. All while being sub 200! CM customer support is also a notch above some of the other brands which helps with my uhhh bias.",

          "First off, I would like to say that I purchase this keyboard solely trying to save desk space because of online classes due to Covid and having several books that I need to cross reference at any given time for webex classes. I was originally shaken off because of a few user reviews that said it wasn't up to the task of gaming and I am currently on the wait list for another keyboard that I purchased prior that wont be released for another month impulsively. That said I purchased this after a class with intentions of another build that will be entirely media based. I am 110% satisfied with this keyboard. In fact I can't tell any difference in my gameplay. I'm an average gamer but my FPS gameplay has very slightly improved since. I credit that to a more tactile switch (blues) than anything. I am coming from a $160 mechanical silver lo pro switch 100% keyboard.",
          "This keyboard would be great if not for the main feature of it; bluetooth. There are very few keyboards that are white, wireless, mechanical key switches, and low profile. The bluetooth regularly disconnects and requires deletion and repairing on macOS. So much to the point that I've gone back to my Magic Keyboard. I REALLY wanted to like this keyboard, but it's bugginess won't let me.",
          "\u00a0Where do I start with this controversial keyboard\u2026. I nearly chucked it out the window when I was setting it up. But now, it is my holy grail keyboard of all keyboards. I would buy another one instantly, although I haven\u2019t forgotten the rage of set-up (hence the 4 stars only).I needed to find my \u201cGoldilocks\u201d keyboard that was low-profile (both the switches and the caps), white and sleek, gamer RGB LEDs, included the Number Pad keys, and was hybrid wireless. This last point was the most important, and thank goodness this keyboard nailed it all.I wanted to replace my two keyboards, one wired to my gaming PC and a wireless one for my work laptop, with just ONE keyboard. After searching for hours and reading the reviews I got nervous because no one said if they could do this or they just complained about wireless\u2026. But I had to try.Thank goodness I did. I can now switch effortlessly to my laptop, then when I log off for the day switch to my gaming PC with ONE FLICK! No cluttered desk, I get to have a fun RGB LED work keyboard, and the comfortable low-profile keys sound so good I think.Setting up the initial Bluetooth and lights was a disaster that almost made me quit though. My tips: Read all the instructions. Then, realize the instructions were lacking and try random stuff.Tip #1) So for the first pairing, the instructions say flick the wireless switch, then use the (Cooler Master logo key) + Z + X + C. This is WRONG. Apparently, this doesn\u2019t mean hold all four keys down. Nope, the only thing that works is holding (Cooler Master logo key) + Z OR X OR C. Only the two keys. Also, you can\u2019t even access wireless mode pairing UNLESS you connect one time to it wired first and stay plugged in for set-up. So, connect wired first, then flick the wireless switch, press the keys I mentioned to initiate the Bluetooth setup, then select the device on your PC settings when it is finally found, enter the code that flashes on the keyboard after, and you\u2019re done, you can unplug.Another tip: If you want to do a similar set up as mine (i.e. interchangeably for both a laptop and a PC at the same time) you want to wire it to the laptop first so it recognizes, flick to wireless and do the wireless set up, then move the wire to the PC. It should work on both. You MAY have to repeat the wireless Bluetooth to laptop one more time at this step, but don\u2019t move the wire from your desktop. Just flick switch to wireless, do the wireless laptop pairing again, and you\u2019re good. I had to do this \u201cdouble sync\u201d and was so mad bc I didn\u2019t want to reconnect Bluetooth every time I used my laptop BUT it\u2019s not every time, it was just this once for set up, so don\u2019t worry. Now, I never have to move the wire at all. I just flick the switch and it switches between my devices instantly and it is extremely reliable. Plus, it always stays charged this way.Last tip: You gotta get the (free) Cooler Master lighting software on their website. The built in settings are just too fast, but I was able to get a calm reactive rainbow using the software.All in All: this is the only keyboard out there that makes me 100% happy to use. Maybe, if they added a volume wheel on the next version I would get that too, but otherwise this is the best of the best for my work needs, gaming needs, physical needs, and aesthetic needs.",
          "Beautiful looking 60% white mechanical keyboard. Nice sleek minimal design. Clean floating keys look, low profile keycaps with a clean typeface. Easily accessible arrow keys without needing to use the fn keys. Extensive alternative key functions. Nice feel and great sounding blue clicky switches. Very clicky sounding, but oddly satisfying. Great color range, but the brightness range is very low. Bonus: kick out feet for better angles.Overall, it looks like beautiful sleek keyboard and feels fairly nice. I wish I would like to keep it, but what started as a few small annoyances began to continuously bother me to point of returning the item.As the other reviewer said, this keyboard is uneven and is not perfectly flat. For me, it's only slightly uneven on the front left foot, but at this price this keyboard should not have this problem. If you put weight on the corner, you can hear the keyboard off balance and bounce against the desk whenever you use it. Using the kickstand helps, but the imbalance is still noticeable. I planned on only using this as a wired keyboard, but thought the bluetooth option was a nice touch. However, there is a charging/charged led light that never turns off on the capslock button. It is either red or blue and bothers me since the rest of the keyboard's lights can be controlled and customized, but this bright led sorely stands out. This light is even brighter than the rest of the keys. There is an amazing range of rgb colors, but the brightness is not bright enough for a lit room. I'm not too big on rgb, but I think this is a big selling point of this keyboard and in my opinion they didn't hit the mark with this one. The leds don't light up the fn or secondary functions of the keys well due to the led being located on the top portion of the keys. It's not too big of a deal, since it can help in keeping the look less cluttered when using the keyboard in the dark, but sometimes you need to see all the different fn keys and the low brightness and amount of shine through does create a problem. Another selling point for this keyboard is the ambient led on the borders of the keyboard, but its low brightness doesn't really do much for the looks in a well lit room. You can only appreciate the rgb capabilities in a very dark setting.The keyboard looks amazing on picture and feels pretty nice, but the uneven feet, surprisingly low brightness, and annoyingly bright and continuous charging led is enough to warrant a return especially for a keyboard at this price.",
          "this keyboard is almost good, solid keys, easy to use settings, nice building 60% with arrow keys etc. but it misses one important aspect, the quality control. It cannot be laying flat on the table, my 30 dollar keyboard wouldn't even have that problem. I have to return it at the end which is sad cause I put so much expectations on it.UPDATE:I ordered another one from amazon hope it was just me being luncky to get a defective one but no, the second keyboard has the exact same issue, what a shame cooler master! first ever bought your product and it is for sure the last time I purchase from this brand.",
          "\u00a0This thing freaking rocks. The led is super easy to controll and customize (while plugged in and Bluetooth is off) and easy to change between presets when connecting by Bluetooth. Highly recommend this keyboard or any others from the same lineup.",
          "TLDR; it hits all the marks I wanted in a keyboard: low profile, good build, mechanical, 60% , white color, good price.I was on the hunt for a reasonably priced, $80 or below, LOW profile mechanical gaming keyboard in white. Surprisingly hard to find, especially from a brand I've actually heard of...I wanted low profile because it does make a it easier on your wrist angle and also they are slightly faster to actuate the key.Glad I ran into the sk620. It hits everything. Now I'm not a keyboard enthusiast so the sound and feel of switches isn't my specialty. I ordered the red and brown style, I ended up sticking with the brown. They were less \"sharp?\" sounding and some of the keys on the red were louder than others. Could of been a bad run? The browns were more uniform across all keys. I recorded some decibel readings and the browns were quieter by 1 or 2 db, so not much but some . ALSO because it's so low profile and a 60% size I think having very small tactile feedback from the browns helps a bit to feel confident in your press. The red was almost too fast and easy to click other keys on accident.The size takes some getting used to, but it's all muscle memory you get a hang of it coming from a full size. Biggest thing is the right side shift key is smaller and the delete key is next to the arrow keys. Anyone in the market for a 60% should know youll have to adapt a bit. Butfor gaming it's such a nice size.For general typing the keyboard is accurate and snappy, I hit 81wpm with 97% accuracy which for me is my fastest yet. It is louder than a normal membrane keyboard, so just realize that, just cause its low profile doesn't make it that much quieter than the full sizeBuild quality feels solid enough, has a metal top plate, good rubber feet and height adjustable. The keycaps are ABS but they seem really well coated compared to my older keyboards with a nice matte texture.Cable is braided and color matched, uses USB-C which is great to see. You also get a keycap puller in the box to make it easier if you need to remove any.RGB is great and bright, with a LOT of customization options in the software. Also in there you can set macros and disable/remap keys which is incredible handy.",
          "I absolutely love this keyboard. I love the RGB, the size, the look, and everything about it. Cooler Master wins with the arrow keys as well. There's really nothing bad I can say about this keyboard at all. Quick note; you cannot use this keyboard wirelessly with the PS4. Kinda bummed about that but I really didn't need that feature. Otherwise amazing product. Looks awesome with my white setup!",

          "This is the most beautiful looking, most functional keyboard I've owned. I love that it's full-size, wireless, uses cherry MX keys, can connect to 3 devices, Mac or Windows, and has that sleek, silver brushed metal modern look with white keycaps.But... what a mess.First, what other reviewers have said about sticky keys is true. At first, I thought, \"surely keys don't physically get stuck on every keyboard they ship\" and took my chance. But no, that's not it.  It's not that keys physically get stuck; instead, it appears Bluetooth signal gets lost sometimes, giving it the appearance that a once-pressed key is not released. And my keyboard is less than a foot from my computer. So. Yeah. That happens.Second, one of the manuals (there's 2) that comes with the keyboard clearly says that wired mode is supported and that it is auto-detected by connecting the keyboard. Well. It doesn't.Third, the lights are a mess.  So much a mess:1. The numlock, capslock, and scrollock LEDs (if they are LEDs at all) above the number pad don't seem to function at all. I haven't seen them light up at any point no matter what I try.2. The way you tell whether the keyboard is in \"Mac\" mode vs. \"Windows\" mode is by its color. Mac is white, and Windows is blue.  Had to read through every fine print on the manual to figure that one out and it's only mentioned in passing.  And you know what looks similar?  Bright blue and white LEDs.  On a keyboard that has a bunch of other colors.  I have to pause every time I want to figure this one out.3. Many of the LEDs on the keyboard are multi-purpose which is confusing. The worst of it seems to be the CapsLock key -- The LED you can see through the hole on the CapsLock keycap (no, this is not a glowing LED *under* the CapsLock keycap, and not the capslock LED *over* the numberpad, but there is a hole on the CapsLock keycap that shows an extra LED) -- It's used to indicate when Bluetooth is searching for a device (blinking blue), when Bluetooth is in pairing mode (fast blinking blue), when the keyboard is charging (red), and when the keyboard is fully charged (green).  But you know what it doesn't tell you? -- whether the CapsLock is enabled.But here's a thing. There is no other keyboard on the market that I know of that uses Cherry MX Keys, is wireless, and can connect to multiple devices both Mac and Windows, let alone look sleek. So I'm gonna use this for now. I just won't like that this is my best option.*** Update March 18, 2023 ***Lowering the rating to 1.The sticky key problem is becoming more frequent. I'm starting to get concerned the problem will cause a real problem, particularly when typing numbers into spreadsheets and other places that involve numerical calculations. I've decided to return the item.",
          "I bought this keyboard about 3 months ago. In the last week it stopped typing properly. Sometimes I have to push a key multiple times for it to register, and sometimes the barest touch of a key causes it to type multiple letters. The space bar randomly decides to act like it's being leaned on. Characters register out of order. I've tried it both wired and wireless on two different computers (one mac, one windows) and the behavior is atrocious on both!

It took another 2 months for the replacement to actually arrive. So 6 months total between my RMA request and receiving the replacement. Quite frankly, their support sucks.The replacement lasted 3 weeks before it started having the same issues as the original. Even worse than before! Ultimately it's a gorgeous keyboard and felt great to work on, but being 2 for 2 on duds it's not at all reliable and was a total waste of money and time for me.",
          "I had some initial trouble connecting this keyboard to my MacBook Air. My laptop was not recognizing the new bluetooth device. After turning both on and off a few times I finally was able to connect the two. Now that they are paired the keyboard automatically connects every-time I turn it on. It's perfect. The keys have multiple light-up features, which make me so happy while I work. Occasionally, when typing really fast the keyboard will miss a letter or two. But I've learned if I slow down a bit, it doesn't happen anymore.",

It's a good looking keyboard as well and because of its low profile, it's easy to transport in my backpack. Being able to quickly switch between deviceis a huge benefit for me.",
          "This keyboard has the potential to be such an amazing product. Unfortunately, the overall typing experience kills it. I get way too many typographical errors... an issue I don't seem to have with my built-in laptop keyboard or other less expensive keyboards I've tried connecting.As other reviewers have mentioned, the keystroke results are sometimes unpredictable. Strike a key once and it may stick, so if you type \"1\", you may get \"111111\". Or, if you strike \"11\", you may only get \"1\". It's too the point where it sometimes takes me over a minute to log into my computer because I can't seem to enter my password accurately without using the text show-me feature to proof what I'm typing. Extremely frustrating.I'm not sure what the cause is. I've tried multiple connectivity options to see if the typing accuracy would improve. Bluetooth, dongle, direct connection through cable. I've had the same issue with each. In fairness I have not tried reaching out to customer support or deep-diving into messing around with settings/features. Though, based on other users experiencing the same issue, I suspect it may be a flaw in the product design quality.I love everything else about the keyboard. I just can't use it to type reliability, which is a major problem!If Cooler Master can improve the typing accuracy and experience on this model, I'll be back in a heartbeat. Until then, I'm out!",

I made sure my OS and all drivers were up to date and I also moved my laptop about 10\" away from the keyboard, but nothing seemed to help. I don't seem to have any issues with BT mice, headsets or speakers, but wireless keyboards all seem to have the same experience.

You don't get that mechanical keyboard feeling, and the keys do feel a little \"rubbery\" but it performs great.The mouse feels pretty light and cheap but again it works well and gets the job done.I have also used a previous model myself for a couple years and had no issues with keys sticking or dying.",
          "Big fan of the build quality. Can tell it's a genuine product, and the keys give a nice tactile feedback. It is loud to type on, though I learned to type on a typewriter so I'm used to the noise and appreciate it. Some of the keys become dislodged in the box, though because of the nature of the keyboard they popped right back on no problem. Lighting options are versatile, and it has solid brightness. This might be a tough keyboard for kids however that are still learning to type, since it's a backlight the keys themselves are quite dark.My one complaint: the spacebar. Its input point is in the middle with only shallow anchors towards the sides, so it's very loud, and rattles a bit when pressed. This'd be an easy fix if they added connection points in addition to the one in the middle toward the sides.",
          "No two ways about it Ive got kids and they are destructive little mess makers. That said,this keyboard has survived having salsa dumped on it,sugared coffee poured into it,and its come through it all working JUST as good as the day I unboxed it. They keys are super responsive,the lighting is easy to figure out,and the mouse has every button you could want for any PC based games you're playing. I spend a lot of time gaming/typing and  I usually start to suffer spacebar and AWSD failures pretty fast,thus far, ZERO issues! Even with the little ones \"helping mommy type\". Amazing product and if/when it finally dies I will absolutely get another one",
          "I ordered this item a year ago. Man, that time flew by. I use this key/mouse combo primarily for WoW but also other games, and had completely forgotten what brand it even was. I recently got a new PC with a computer case from the same brand. The light-up colors match. I'm sure these things break or come defective for some people, but it was definitely worth the money for me and is still working great. $30 is a heck of a deal for this.",
          "This combo is easily one of the best value for money for gaming keyboard and mouse.The keyboard is the best part of this combo, the lighting color options and adjustability are top notch. The keys are a great balance between mechanical feel and comfort and are some of the quietest mechanical keys I've used.The mouse has nice details, nice lighting, and is very comfortable to use. The side buttons are perfect for gaming, and the lighting color button is accessible while also being out of the way where you won't hit it accidentally.Knocked one star off for two reasons. 1: There seems to be no memory setting for the lighting. Every time I start up my computer I have to cycle through the colors back to where I want it. Maybe there is a way to save settings I'm just not noticing? 2: The mouse buttons are SO LOUD. Considering how soft and quietly the keys engage on the keyboard, it doesn't make much sense that the mouse clicks be as loud as they are. But overall I am very pleased with both mouse and keyboard.",
          "It's a good thing, but if you can save up to buy something better quality, better do it",
          "So, I like the adjustable backlighting colors. Haven't really used many of the advanced features for gaming or whatever, like the extra button on the side of the mouse. Though, it's nice to have some sound adjustment capabilities directly on the keyboard again.Seems like mouse an keyboard are \"separately adjusted,\" IE not \"sync'd\" in any meaningful way. It would be kind of nice if the lighting could be tied together for a uniform color scheme where you adjust on one and it automatically adjusts on the other (if sync'd; or separately if you set some setting to adjust them separately).It would also be nice if the color choice persisted past a reboot or power cycle. It seems like, if you turn the computer off, both go back to their default color scheme. If you reboot without turning off, it seems like the keyboard usually [maybe not always?] \"remembers\" its prior color setting, but the mouse \"forgets\" what color it was set to prior to the reboot, which is weird. You'd think they'd either both remember or both forget, since they come packaged together. You'd think they'd have the same behavior across a reboot or power cycle. But, apparently not?Anyway, overall, I like them. Been wanting a back-lit keyboard for a while, and these seem like a relatively inexpensive option for basic back-lighting and your fairly standard keyboard functionality. And, for me, the key travel and typing feedback of the keyboard feel good.So, overall good with a few areas that could be improved. I know there are some newer models from Cooler Master, but I like the general look and layout of this model compared to some of the newer ones that, IIRC, seemed a bit too \"edgeless\" and/or \"un-styled\" for my taste.",
          "Biggest gripe about this set is the LED colors DO NOT stay the same when you turn your computer on.  If you have them white with a certain effect, it will reset to the default after you shut your computer down.  This is really annoying to have to cycle through everything to get it back to the way you have it each time.  Not the best for gaming either.  There is no software with the keyboard or mouse for you to change dpi, sensitivity, etc.  Would be good for a starter keyboard or for a kid just getting into gaming.  I feel it is misleading for them to brand this a \"Gaming\" keyboard.  After 5 months, I switched for Razer.  You WILL notice an improvement.",
          "***UPDATE*** DO NOT BUY!!! My keyboard has become unresponsive. I keep it in a clean adult owned, No pet, no food area and for some reason my keyboard is unresponsive. The background lights are on but the keys are unresponsive. I contacted cooler master tech support and was responded to 1hour and 15 minutes after I sent the ticket in. They advised me that I possibly locked the keyboard and to press Fn+ F11, and when that didn't work I tried Fn+F12, F11, F12, I tried unplugging and plugging back in, I checked to make sure all of the drivers were up to date, I even tried it on another computer  all without any success. I wrote back advising them of my efforts and have not hear ANYTHING since then, I believe its now been 6 days.I then sent in a request for warranty replacement and was promptly told that I have to wait for them to respond, and that it could take a while because they have A LOT of tickets to go through(then why a response the first time within 1 hour and 15 minutes but now more than 6 days???) Also included in this warranty email response was information telling me why they are rejecting my request... They advised that because I didn't send a picture of both the mouse and the keyboard at the same time they are denying my warranty request? I was trying to be nice and explained that the mouse seems to be working fine, and it was the keyboard only giving me problems. So i sent the warranty request with a picture of the keyboard only??? I have included emails and screen shot of my communication with cooler master. Not only does the keyboard not going to work, but the customer service is terrible too!!! a DOUBLE WAMMY!!! I will update this if they ever respond back to my emails.***2nd Update*** After alot of back and forth I was advised that my keyboard was still under warranty and that I had to pay for shipping back to them and they would replace and send out a new one.adding one star for this... but not happy to spend $15 to ship the computer back. They could of at the bare minimum allow me an option to purchase a return label from them at their discounted rate. Instead $15 for a $40 keyboard that should work longer than it did! I see some bad reviews but took a chance and it has paid off. I have been using this keyboard/mouse since August 8th of 2017. I am using this on my first computer build and have been very happy with it! You are able to choose which color you want the keyboard to light up or you can have it cycle through the colors on its own. The mouse is able to change on its own separate from the keyboard. I type around 60 words per minute and have found the keyboard to be adequate for my needs and have had no problems at all.",
          "Pros: volume adjust buttons over the print screen buttons, not loud when typing, colors are niceCons: I wish the pink/magenta color was as vibrant as the rest of the colors. When the backlight is off, you can't read the keys AT ALL. I need a keyboard that can tilt towards me more too, and this doesn't do that. I have fibromyalgia and wrist pain, so this keyboard isn't very comfortable. The font on the keys are terrible as well, chunky, blocky, and takes awhile to get used to! Also I hate the mouse, so I still use my wireless Logitech mouse instead. The mouse that goes with the keyboard has terrible tracking. I'd return it if I didn't need the keyboard so badly.",
          "The plastic is pretty good quality, has something of a matte finish so it feels soft to touch and doesn't drag your skin when gliding on it surface. Buttons are as sensitive as they should be for a gaming computer and every light setting looks very nice and is easy to change due to the on-board button. Keyboard is great, the mouse is has everything that made the keyboard great with the exception that it's a bit big and if you have an average sized mouse the size may take a little while to get used to. Overall for this price I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",
          "Light still bright, mouse buttons feel exactly the same after a year. Amazing value for the money. You should get this if you're not some kind of weird keyboard typing snob. It's obviously not some $200 cherry rgb blah blah blah whatever... I just bought another one for a friend. Was really hoping they were still making these.Can't remember if the description says or not, but both the mouse and keyboard have a dedicated button to cycle through your color options. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Teal, pinky/purple, white, off.",
          "people find it issue with membrane keys, but I haven't found to be a problem.  its comfortable to type.couple things though, wish stand tap stood little higher, bit flat even with two kick out stand is out.  certain lighting makes some keys hard to see and wish it had light memory.  whenever computer is booted I have to reselect the lights.",
          "The keyboard is pretty good. When I first got it, I feel in love with it. However, I've used it for about 6 months now (I'm on my computer on average a few hours a day for work or gaming) and I'm starting to notice some keys are getting harder and harder to push down. My backspace key, A key, and M key... It makes typing on this very frustrating as I'll typo a word with one of those letters, then go to backspace, but not actually backspace the number of times I'm pushing down.I'm giving this 3 stars for the nice color options, general feel of the keyboard, and nice mouse, however with the key issues I'm having, I can't keep using this keyboard. Maybe it was just the one I have or the way I type, but just keep this mind. This is the one drawback from getting a $40 keyboard/mouse combo.",
          "My son loves it , and the collor looks good also good plastic material# shipping was safe and fast.",
          "This is my go to combo when I need an inexpensive keyboard and mouse combo that isn't junk.What it is:Well builtDurableLED \"Backlit\"What is isn't:A high end mechanical keyboard and gaming mouseSleek (The design is a little extreme, matching the older CoolerMaster cases)The keyboard and mouse hold up to kids and adults alike. My oldest set in the house is around 7 years old now and the newest are around 6 months. All still work great.If you can find it for around $40 its definitely a 5 star item.",
          "The 'feeling' is a bit different than a typical gaming keyboard. Well I didn't buy it specifically for gaming as I use my game controller for that but I can still use it for FPS like Counter Strike.The reason I bought it was my case is Cooler Master and I wanted my keyboard/mouse/pad to be also CM with lighting effects. For that, I absolutely made the right decision. Lights are amazingly beatiful and there are many options to change them. As for the feeling, I love it, there is a slight resistance when you press a key and that feels good. I don't like it when I press a keyboard key and it goes down like it's broken or something, no resistance.Having said that, it doesn't mean that the keyboard its silent but I like the sound it makes when I'm typing.So it may not work for everybody but it worked for me, I would not change it to anything else.",
          "I needed a color changing backlit keyboard and mouse on a budget and these had better reviews for the price range than other models. For $30 it is a pretty good deal and the issues I have with them in no way affect their performance as gaming devices. For starters the keys are very loud which is typical of this variety of keyboard. The sound is not that of a 1990s plastic keyboard, it is more robust, but definitely still \"clackey\". Backlight levels are easily adjusted and get dim enough for my preferences but when the light is completely off the letters on the keys are so dark that it is difficult to see them. Product looks great, arrived on time in good condition and I would buy it again if I needed to. Would recommend to a friend for the price.",
          "The purchase was for a friend whose system I just completed. He wanted a new keyboard that wasn't software dependent. This keyboard/ mouse combo was definitely the way to go.Keystroke and mouse sensitivity was as advertised. The change of color(s) simple. The only thing I have a question about is the \"Back light Pulsate Speed\". I attempted the documented keystrokes, and in result, nothing. Would Cooler Master care to elaborate on this issue?The back light is bright with an adjustment to dim.  There was something else that caught my eye, how dark the keys become when the light is off. This may be caused by the light rubber textured overlay on the individual keys, possibly tinting the characters.The mouse is appealing to look at, however the feel is somewhat different. The top represents a thin layer of plastic. This runs alone the parameter of the mouse. To make up for this, Cooler Master used  real rubber for grip control. Adjusting color from the DPI's can be a little tricky.Every thing considered, I am happy with the purchase, and so is my friend.",
          "Looks good, feels nice.  I like the angles on the mouse.  Backlight is nice too.  At first I was very happy with this keyboard.But after 6 months, I'm falling out of love with it.  Several keys just stick down and it's a pain unsticking them.  What's strange is they don't get stuck and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, they just get stuck down and don't work.I will note I have not had any of the issues other reviews have of not remembering its color.  Set mouse, set KB, then it stays that color always, even after being powered down for a week, it stays set.I don't have a cat or any pet around keyboard.  I don't eat or drink in a way to get spills or crumbs in keyboard.  Occasionally hit it with canned air and wipe off dust - every other month maybe.  It should have gone much longer without issues than it has and will replace with different brand (even though I have lots of cooler master stuff and like them overall).",
          "Only real issue I have with it, the keys are a little buggy. Not bad at all, it actually rarely happens and isn't even a big deal. But sometimes I feel like one of the keys take a little longer to return. I mean like a half a millisecond or something like that. Also the shift key is slightly harder to press than the rest. You likely won't even notice but it is worth mentioning. For the price though you really can't beat this combo. One more thing worth noting. There is a forward and back button on the side of the mouse where your thumb goes if you're right handed. I keep accidently hitting it pretty much anytime I type a review. Let's hope that doesn't happen this time.I do business with Cooler Master regularly. I can say they stand by their warranties. I ended up paying shipping but they did replace a 4 year old power supply. I think it was 4 years old anyway.I guess if you want to save the money and get a good keyboard and mouse combo then go ahead and get this.",
          "Amazing keyboard and mouse combo! Really good ergonomics mouse is smooth feels good In your palm forward and back button have a nice click to them, right and left clickers have a nice easy click to them. The keyboard is amazing I personally prefer membrane keyboards and this one is by far my favorite for the price the RGD lighting is just perfect. The response from the keys is on point and perfect. Overall Quality is amazing soft plastic for the mouse that feels great and not cheap same goes for the keyboard. For 35$ what more could you ask it's an amazing ok purchase!",
          "Key characters could be a bit larger and clearer. Back lighting on/off switch could be moved to a less used area since it's current placement to the right of the spacebar makes it too easy to accidentally hit and turn off the back lighting. Overall both the keyboard and mouse are comfortable to use for extended periods of time. Mouse pointer is accurate with no skipping.",
          "Pros-Feels like a mechanical keyboard at times-Multiple LED colors for both keyboard and mouse-Able to switch or turn off the LED lights very easily-Very durable-Good quality and designI have always been a fan of, \"Cooler Master\" for a couple of years now. This is my first time trying out their keyboard and mouse and I have to say that this was a good choice on my behalf.Anyone who is starting or are experience in gaming on a computer, I would recommend this product to them!5 Star rating!(Might be purchasing another one of these for my mother as a gift).",
          "I'm not one to typically write reviews for products, but i felt this one was in need of one. I've been using it for a few hours getting a feel for everything as im using this to replace an old and broken expensive mechanical mouse and keyboard. Here are my thoughts on the mouse:- The shape is a little awkward at first but is nothing extreme to note, you get used to it relatively quickly.- The mouse glides as it should and so far I haven't noticed any skipping even when changing to mouse pads with different materials.- The side buttons are awkward for big hands but still managable to play any game including FPS's.- The lights are vibrant and can be changed to every color the keyboard can, props on this one, the button for changing the lights is never in the way unlike a lot of mice I've used.My thoughts on the keyboard:- Comes with standard keys but you can always change to loud mechanical if you want.- The elevation stands in the back leave much to be desired personally, they allow the keyboard to sit barely risen up, it could do with another half inch raise.- As the mouse, the lights are vibrant and have a couple settings for them.- The keys are spaced out and wide enough for someone with bigger hands and includes the side number pad.TL/DRgreat value for the price, makes a pretty good gift",
          "I picked up this keyboard and mouse setup on sale for about $30. The keyboard looks and feels nice. The mouse looks nice, but is a bit small for my hands. Also, the lights on the mouse don't save on shutdown, so when rebooting it always reverts back to red (not a big deal for me, but I have heard from other reviews that this happened with the keyboard too). Without my main issue with the kb/m this would easily be a 3 or 4 star rating.Why am I giving this such a low rating? Well, this kb/m setup literally crashes my computer. After doing some research, it looks like I was sent a faulty kb/m. I ran many tests over the week I had it, so I have no doubt that it is this kb/m setup causing this issue. But also...When this was shipped to me, it looked like it had been open and already used. It still looked a bit brand new, so I just shrugged it off. The thing is, I think someone bought this, saw there was a fault in the kb/m and returned it. And this company just repacked it and shipped it to me.Absolute garbage. Do not buy from this shipper / manufacturer.",
          "Was informed of this combo kit with having wanted to get into gaming as well as needing a quality kit for my home office. RGB makes it cool but solid starter. Full functioning keyboard, gaming mouse and nice mechanical feel while being affordable. Very happy I bought this kit without spending hundreds on a kit.",
          "This is actually the 2nd one I bought. I originally bought one thinking I was going to have to replace my old trusty Devastator 2 set thinking it was dying. Still dont know why it would stop working but it stopped happening LONG ago so it wound up in my closet for months. Ultimately I gave it to my little brother with that machine when I built my new machine... and decided I liked how well it behaved enough to buy a the second one as an actual replacement.It feels every bit as good as the 2. I'm not a \"mechanical\" purist so take that as you will and UNLIKE the 2 the light starts on (a big plus). The only thing I can say against it is that neither the mouse nor the keyboard remembers the color you set... you will always turn on to a red glow. Still, in both cases I can overlook this as it's a small price to pay (for me) to not need to install software to control this... mechanical control means my machine is all the leaner.",
          "I really like the feel of the mouse and keyboard. The mouse is bigger than average, which is what I want in a gaming mouse. However, I am bummed out by one of side buttons not working. I hope I can get an exchange for the mouse because this is by far the best mouse that I own.",
          "The mouse has no dpi button (The earlier version of the mouse does, this is the newer version.) You CAN NOT  change the dpi setting in windows, you can only change it in-game which is frustrating to say the least.  Hey but at least it is pretty and changes colors.",
          "Nice keyboard for the money but mouse wheel has an annoying clicking or grinding sound when I\u2019m turning it which is annoying. Also packaging was non existent, it was as if you were going to buy it of the shell at a store but the box was all ripped up.",
          "Keyboard's alright, keys feel good and doesn't make too much noise. Backlighting is handy sometimes, but the brightness control for it is sort of pointless as it only dims down the light just by a bit per level. Other than that, great overall for my usage (gaming, surfing web). Mouse as well is good, fits my hand nicely, and I like that back/foward buttons have more resistance on this one as I don't need to accidently press them when I'm using it. It has backlight just like the keyboard, but it only provides only one level of brightness and for some reason it gets a little warm after awhile. But not quite bothersome even for my sweaty hands, so mouse is not bad either. Good buy for the price.",
          "keyboard works great if your looking almost over the top of it with the legs up. but lean back a bit and you cannot make out the keys from middle up. it needs to be about another 3/8th inch higher. also you have to hit the middle of a lot of keys or they kind of kind of bind up so you need extra force to make them work. for the price it is just ok it could be a lot better.",
          "I just built a new computer and got this to hold me over. The RGB lights are bright and very cool; but they reset to red every time you reboot. I usually switch it right to green. After a few months; the keyboard started acting up. It would randomly disconnect. I switch ports and uninstalled/reinstalled drivers; and it's been working for awhile since. Although I've seen other users with this issue. For the price, it's great.",
          "The price is just right for this set. The only down side of the Devastator 3 vs previous models is that the mouse DPI controls now require more than one key to be pressed at a time which is not a great use experience mid-game (and not very accessible).",
          "Great keyboard and mouse combo. Last one I ordered was in 2014 and it lasted 8 years. It would have lasted longer, but I was just ready for a new one. Can't beat the value for the money spent.",
          "Dominator 3 ReviewPros: Price. RGB. Decent feel and response from keyboard and mouse.Cons: this does not compete with my $200 Corsair keyboard and my $100 gaming mouse.DUH if you are looking for a good looking keyboard to get into gaming this is a great start. I always advise a test run to make sure your hands fit good on the board.  Then in a year spend money on a mechanical keyboard etc.",
          "I bought this because my Devastator 2 stopped working after 5 1/2 years. Loved the Devastator 2 so I got the 3. I love the feel of both the keyboard and mouse.Only downside is my mouse does not save which color I set the LED to where my keyboard saves it. A little frustrating but not really worth an RMA/Return. Overall great keyboard/mouse duo.",
          "I like Cool Master's keyboards and their mouses have the extra buttons convenient for my hand.  Love the various color options for the lights plus their support app helps if you have any firmware issues after a Windows Update which is convenient.Even tho I replaced my previous one due one too many coffee spills, these keyboards have an overflow kind of design where even if liquids get into the keys, they don't get into the keyboards chip boards themselves.",
          "Great product, only thing I wish it had was some kind of way to remember the color I chose when I reboot the pc.",
          "I got this keyboard on sale. Best $30 I've ever spent. The Cherry MX clear switches give great physical feedback with very little sound. Typing and gaming on the ms110 are great experiences. While it took me a minute to figure out how to customize the rgb, and I enjoy the range of colors. Combined with the fact that its bright enough to be visible but not bright enough to be used as a flashlight, this keyboard really is great. However, I do have a few problems with it. To start, the keyboard is very tall. When using it, I actually had to pull out and empty the center drawer on my desk so it could be low enough to use it.The mouse that comes the keyboard feels light, but too light. While the brightness on the rgb under the mouse keys is perfect, the limited range of color options for the dimly lit mouse wheel sort of kills it. On top of that, the color of the mouse wheel is tied to the sensitivity of the mouse. I love the keyboard, the mouse is OK, but they arent worth $60.",
          "It's a very great keyboard the rgb colors are vibrant, tactile feel is very good, size and weight are real good , not some flimsy fly away keyboard it sits way firm , and the mouse is perfect weight and the colors match and again very vibrant with great  sensitivity on the buttons. It's a Killer FPS Setup for the $ combined, a true bargain . I bought it for 38.99 on amazon with free delivery and a 20$ rebate  from Cooler Master = 21$ out of pocket, tax included. I'm an old Quaker (Like in Quake 1-2-3 And 4. Highly Recommended !!!",
          "My old keyboard recently went out, but I love this one so much more. It looks identical to my old one except for the fact that I can change the colors of it. It also came with a mouse for the same price as the old single keyboard! It's great for gaming and school!",
          "Font is easy to read and backlighting is good. The 'feel' to them isn't too bad either. I had a devastator 2 set for years. This is better and worse in some ways. I don't have to use scroll lock to enable backlighting anymore, which is nice.I bought two sets though, and both keyboards struggle to keep up with the spacebar somehow? I type three or 4 characters quite fast along with the spacebar, and it puts the space before the last letter instead of after the word. The mice are both fine, always pleasant to have side-buttons. These are quite clicky though.Good for the price, excellent value, and I like the media keys. If it weren't for the ghosting I'd give them perfect marks.",
          "This is a solid mouse/keyboard combo with bright colored lights.  My son loves them both!",
          "I bought this keyboard because I wanted a keyboard that was purple (or that I could keep purple). One of the best things about this keyboard is that it is comfortable to type on. The colors are nice and vibrant. My only complaint is that this keyboard does not have the option to keep your color choice. You have to cycle through it every time you boot your pc to get the color that you want.",
          "This product is pretty excellent. It's pretty, sleek, valuable, works great, easy to operate (literally just plug in) and wasn't too pricey. One gripe I have is that the mouse squeaks, and the space bar squeaks as well.I liked this product so much that, after I spilled beer on it locking up the CTRL key forever, I bought another one just like it! Unfortunately the company that shipped my 2nd order, Triplenet Pricing INC, shipped me a weirdo version w/ like crazy symbols and a half-sized left side SHIFT key (so annoying) and a spanish N and all the punctuation is messed up... so I basically have to learn to re-type or can't use it. I'm trying to return it but... it's either that or keep using the one where the left CTRL key is not functional, since it appears you basically can't buy this anymore? Super bummer.",
          "Pros:  Comfortable to type on.  Inexpensive.  Backlit keyboard (the reason I bought it) works.  Plug and play install (I run Win 10 Home).  Color on keyboard and mouse are controlled separately and do not need to be the same color (you can have a green mouse and red keyboard for example).  Backlight on both keyboard and mouse can be toggled off if you don't want lights at all.Cons:  Has volume +/- buttons but no 'mute' button ('mute' button significant while gaming/watching movies). Backlight color is not remembered; when the computer is restarted the color on the mouse and keyboard defaults to red and you must manually toggle to change it to another color or to toggle off.  \"Right-click\" key on the keyboard is replaced by the backlight toggle button; this is probably not even something noticed by 99% of the people who will buy this.Other thoughts:  Would be 4.5 stars if it were possible to do so.  Would be a solid 5 stars if the keyboard had a mute button.  If it didn't have any volume buttons I probably wouldn't even care but since they're there and functional, it's irking not to have mute as well.  Would be an enthusiastic 5 stars if backlight remembered the last color set.",
          "Bought my combo on April 23,2020. Everything worked wonderfully, until September 21, 2020. ( I rarely game as I work long hours in a construction field ) but I decided to play a game I had bought before I went on vacation, I was 20-30 mins into the game and my keys stopped responding. I figured the game may have glitched so I restarted my pc. This did not resolve. Being a tech smart person ( worked in the repair field for 4 years prior to my newer job ) I checked on other PCs ( same issue - lights up but doesn\u2019t respond ) as well as checked for reset button combo - none listed worked either.My pc is a new build - April 2020, everything works - and is updated ( as I keep on these things ) currently awaiting to hear back from manufacture for warranty ( I RMA the keyboard as it\u2019s clearly a defective product)I\u2019m giving the product 3 stars - as it did work great for the price prior to the issue. I will update as it comes!I got a defective product but that doesn\u2019t mean you will ( defects are usually slim ) however be aware that this issue appears in many forums. Hopefully it is now a known issue some of their products can get",
          "Have got 5 of these. While the first 4 were pretty good, the last one I bought they must have done something with the manufacturing process that makes the keys 'crunch' when depressed now, and if they're not getting caught when pressed at an angle, they squeak now. Think trying to hit Ctrl-Left-Arrow or Control-Right-Arrow.Also, the first 4 were $39.95 each, the fifth one was $44, but now they want $75. Yeah no, that right there.  Sorry, time to switch until either they fix the problem described above, or they go back down to $39 bucks.Oh, and as someone else mentioned: the 5th one came with the shipping sticker just slapped right onto the box, no packaging whatsowever."

          "After looking at the reviews, I had a little bit of skepticism buying this keyboard. In the end, I wanted my waifu to try a keyboard that was more like the Apple keyboard, so I got it. I've been using the Masterkeys Pro RGB and the Masterkeys Pro S White, and there have been a lot of pleasant things I've noticed about this keyboard.* While the spacebar is still a bit clacky, the keyboard overall is A LOT QUIETER. My Masterkeys Pro RGB is using full size Cherry MX Browns, and the Pro S White Cherry MX Reds, and the low profile switchers on the SK630 are downright silent by contrast.* Keys are responsive. The responsiveness and tactile feedback from the SK630 are better than the MasterKeys Pro boards on its worst day. Because the travel distance is so much lower, you get nearly instant feedback that's great for both typing and gaming, where speed is of the essence.* Looks. I mean, c'mon, the low profile just looks so damn svelte.* USB-C. Probably results in better responsiveness and power delivery for the LEDs, but also fits at a less awkward angle, because the cable plugs in straight. I guess I could buy a non-angled cable for the Pro S RGB, which has a right angle, but whatever. The Pro S White definitely wins out with its hide-away cable routing, but I dig the updated delivery of USB-C on the SK630.* Profile. The profile of the SK630 is definitely a lot better. It's a bit thicker than the Apple keyboard, but a lot thinner than the Masterkeys, and a bit thinner than your average plastic clunker that comes with a big box machine.I'll update once I've had some more time to get a feel for this thing. Enjoy!",
          "Writing this review with the keyboard. It is a very pretty keyboard, you'll just want to get  yourself a new set of switches to change out and you'll  want to keep the suede sleeve it comes in so that you  can angle  the keyboard correctly. I've had to fix words several times because they keep repeating and the  space bar keeps pressing twice.",
          "first impression: beautiful, but cheap feeling.second impression: i can't type on this to save my life - literally feels like mushy garbo & the keycaps don't even stay on straight? every other letter is a typo unless i want to type with my actual nail tips - im an avid touch typist with decent speeds & this is legit an awful experience.it takes the faintest of touches for the switch to register, making it that much harder to avoid typoes... maybe with time i could get used to this & not have to backspace every other letter, but not sure if it is even worth that effort, even at 50% off... these key switches feel awful, the shape of the flat keycaps doesn't bother me, its more of the switches & placement is just whack.if you like the low profile mac keyboards, with the  scissor switches, dont get this.here is an example of my typing at an average, slower than usual speed, without fixing my mistakes:> \"hered is an ezxsample of my tytping at an average, slowe3rf than ujsujal speede, without fixing myh mistakeds\"do what you will with this info.i also always wear long, fake nails - but im able to get by with my old mac keyboard... this is just heinous.i'm 99% sure i will return this, might give the alternate keycaps a try, but i am not hopeful that will improve much... as i simply hate the feel of these mushy switches, the keycaps feel nice.",
          "This keyboard feels and looks great. The tactile keys have a very soft but audible \"tap\" sound to them, and feels great to press. The keys are very easy to trigger, and that takes some getting used to. I was clicking extra keys for about a week until I got fully used to how lightly I have to press the keys.It has really good RGB control. You can do basically anything without software. You can set up custom colors using the R, G, and B control with the function key, without ever downloading any software.It's great for travel, it even comes with a soft carry case for it, and the wire is detachable (and USB C. Respect.)The mouse space is really nice to have with the TKL variant. If you're like me and use your numpad for keybinds, data entry, and modded games, grab a wireless numpad for $15 on Amazon and put it on the left side or somewhere away from your mouse space, and you'll have no regrets for TKL.",
          "Review:I don't know if it's the linear style switches or the flat design of the caps but I constantly register neighboring keys when I type at high speeds. See Headline. I have to really concentrate to avoid triggering extra keys and that doesn't cut it for my work.Relevant Info:I do captioning for work and I bought this hoping it would give me similar speeds to my work laptop's factory scissor-switches which give me the highest speed for me personally. I wanted flat keys, and short actuation, but I never tried Linear. My 'main' desktop keyboard at home is a Logitech G915 w/ 10key (Clicky) which is very quiet for being a Clicky switch and closest feel to a laptop so far I've tried. I bought this keyboard wanting to test linear / flat key combo.Takeaway:Visually it's a beautiful keyboard. The brushed aluminum and the lighting is pleasant in my opinion. But there's no way I can confidently type with accuracy on this keyboard and so right now it is just acting as a nice accent to my office desk. My coworkers think it's expensive. If you type at similar speeds to the photo  then I wouldn't get this keyboard. If you have prefer linear keys in a brushed aluminum key-bed or have reasons other than typing fast then this may be for you.",
          "The RGB is actually really cool, with all the different effects. It\u2019s also handy to be able to customise it without software.The key sensitivity is however, way to high as it\u2019s really easy to mis-tap buttons, especially while typing. I think if the keyboard was as low profile as an Apple keyboard, per say, the sensitivity wouldn\u2019t be an issue.",
          "I read the reviews and still decided to get it. One of the switches started misfiring and having delayed responses after just 5 days of use. I didn't mind the flat keycaps but I didn't like the texture. Kind of chalky matte texture and felt a bit scratchy on the way down. Really great look and sound, but typing was a bit harder maybe due to the keycaps but also due to the linear switch, which still requires too much force in my opinion. Even though it's less force than other switches, it actuates earlier but most of the time I bottomed out anyways. Decided to go for a similarly priced board from Perioxx (I think) with Kailh Brown CHOC switches (tactile).",
          "Unlike other reviews, I actually liked the layout of the keycaps. The first year and a half of this keyboard were mostly good, outside of 1 exception. Due to my fingers, and the way that I hit the letters, the D and C key began to wear out. The backlighting was always consistent, but it was kind of visually annoying.After the year and a half the quality dropped off QUICKLY. I had many keys start to double, triple, or sometimes get \"stuck down\" where they would repeat indefinitely. I've built keyboards from scratch before, so I did what I could to replace the keys that would be of issue. This would temporarily fix the problem, but then 2 more keys would have the same problem. This is an unfixable issue. EVEN IF you have the knowledge to replace individual key switches (which is a large effort) there is no way to source replacements.I contacted Cooler Master to get the keyboard replaced under warranty (which is a healthy 3 years), but I was responsible to pay for shipping. The shipping was quite expensive to California, and the keyboard they sent back had the same issues. I'm out of luck, and had to buy a new keyboard.Most of my time with this keyboard was very positive, but for a keyboard that costs as much as it does it should last a lifetime if taken care of properly.",
          "Just received the keyboard and have been using it for few hours. Here are my initial thoughts.Build Quality: For the money ($80) I would of thought that the build quality would be a bit better. The top is aluminum but the bottom is cheap plastic. It just doesn't have a premium feel. My $30 Eagletec feels nicer than this. Plus there are no \"stilts\" to raise the keyboard.Keys: Flat keys seems ok but it did come with some additional \"traditional\" key caps so I may try those. The key spacing is fine imo.Cherry Switches: The switches are good, no complaints. Travel seems fine.RGB effects: Effects are very nice. Plus the fact that you don't need to load any software is plus.Still on fence on whether this will be a keeper or not. The build quality is probably the biggest hang up for me considering the price.",

          "The keyboard is extremely nice. Very sensitive which is great for the serious gamers. It even comes with 2 complet sets of buttons. One set is flat. You can barely notice the keys as your fingers shift. It makes it great for fast finger movement playing games. When typing, I sometimes press two buttons at once because it's so smooth. The other set is a little concave, like standard keys, so your fingers stay in place and you can feel the different keys as your fingers move. Overall I like that you have both options. The smooth I think is fantastic for gaming. Very easy to operate multiple commands with one finger but that can also bite you haha.They backlight options being customizable is also a huge plus. Can't find many keyboards near this price where you can set individual colors on certain keys. I have always liked the option to put WADS as different colors so it's easy to get your hand there at night, with peripherals.",
          "The switches feel very nice and have a very nice length of travel. The switches are very sensitive though, so that combined with the square keycaps make this keyboard very difficult to type on.The light presets are very nice, but can also be difficult to control and it seems to lock up sometimes and gets stuck in certain presets.And finally, as mentioned in the title, the cable it came in did not work. I got it, plugged the keyboard in and was confused about why it didn't work, but after switching to a cable I had lying around, it worked. The cable feels very nice, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't work.",
          "I had high hopes for this mechanical keyboard when I purchased it on sale from Amazon, but unfortunately, it fell far short of my expectations. Despite its sleek appearance, the typing experience was incredibly disappointing. Every keystroke felt like rubbing sandpaper against cement, making it one of the scratchiest keyboards I've ever used - even worse than Cherry MX browns. I even had friends who know nothing about mechanical keyboards try it out, and they all agreed that it was terrible.Additionally, the flat design of the keycaps made typing inaccurate at best. The lack of concavity in the keycaps means that there is no natural guide for your fingers, making it more difficult to find the center of each key and leading to more typing errors. Furthermore, the flat design also makes it more difficult to feel the edges of each key, further reducing your sense of precision when typing.While I was disappointed with this keyboard, I would be willing to reconsider my review if a better unit could be provided. Perhaps I received a defective unit, and a replacement might offer a better typing experience.However, as it stands now, the texture on the key caps felt cheap and likely to wear down quickly with use. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit, but regardless, this keyboard was nothing short of horrendous. If you're looking for a good low profile mechanical keyboard, I recommend checking out the MK Lowkey70 or the Logitech g915/g815. Both come with varying flavors of Kailh mechanical switches, and my personal favorite is the Kailh Choc white.",
          "The lights are pretty, and I love CM's on-keyboard controls for the light, which makes this keyboard compatible with any operating system (I'm using it with Linux).The keyboard is also very comfortable, and while I'm still not sure I'm sold on the flat keycaps, they included a set of scooped keycaps, so I can switch over if I want.The big problem is that the keyboard isn't good at the one job it has above every other \u2014 typing. Multiple keys have problems, producing between 0 and 3 characters per keypress. I have tried to modify my typing style, I have experimented with different levels of pressure. Nothing works consistently, so although I love the feel of the keys, I can't actually use this as a keyboard.On the good side, CM has issued me an RMA, and I'm sending the keyboard in for warranty work as we speak. On the bad side, I'm paying one-way shipping, so this \"wonderful\" keyboard is costing me more money.If CM gets me back a working keyboard, I'll adjust this review. I do want to encourage anyone who gets this keyboard to put it through a torture test within the Amazon return window. If your keyboard has problems like mine, it's better to return with Amazon, who pay shipping.Another note: I'm typing this on my new Cooler Master CK550v2. It doesn't come in a velour bag, and it doesn't have a second set of keycaps, but it's typing every letter as many times as I want it to. The space bar was a little bit stiff (especially compared to the SK650) at first, but seems to have limbered up. In short, I'm a fan of Cooler Master keyboards, and I hope they return the SK650 in working condition. However, for the time being, I would recommend the CK550v2 instead.",
          "This is a pretty nice keyboard for under $100. Low profile yet still maintains the travel of your average mech, though cherry switches are subjective to many.I swapped the keycaps not long after, since the flat laptop style keycaps we're way too difficult to type on, props for including a sculpted set.As for the main seller, the low profile switches. These guys are scratchy, oh man. If you can get by, which is not really a big deal for me, it's not bad, especially the stabilizers. Decent board, only really worth it under $100.",
          "I agree with most of the reviews I read that said the flat keycaps were awful.  Luckily CoolerMaster heard the complaints and offer a second set of contoured keycaps free upon request.  This board came with the second set of keycaps included, saving me the trouble of having to request them.  The first thing I did was replace the keycaps and wow - such a difference!  I write a lot of code and have found typing to be easy and accurate.  I love the feel and sound of the low-profile Cherry MX switches.  It's also just really really really ridiculously good-looking.  Unfortunately there is no SDK for Linux, so I can't use any of the software features.  That said, I don't care that much about the RGB lighting, so not a big deal.",
          "I really love this keyboard, the lighting looks great and I really like the flat chiclet style keycaps, but for whatever reason the keyboard will occasdionally double type. I have no idea why this is, and I'm seeing mixed things on whether this is just a common issue with the keyboard a d my particular one suffers from it (a lot of people seem to have double and/or missed typing) or if it's known behavior that every board will experience at some point. If it's the latter then that really sucks. If not for the double typing it'd be a full 5 stars",
          "GREAT DEAL, Got this on sale for $62! This is the SK650 (original model) which I knew had 2 ergonomic challenges. First was the Keys I read some folks don't get used to the chicklet style keys and can't adjust while others can adjust. And second was the keyboard didn't have kickstands in the back to lift the rear of the keyboard which is on most keyboards. This being said I knew what I was buying based on the deal and accepted the known ergonomic shortcomings of this device even though it shines in many other places! It kind of matters to each individual differently in the end. I knew there was a SK652 version which addressed all this too... probably why this on is on sale as they are getting rid of older inventory.That being said Cooler Master included a full key cap kit which this board with allow the user to swap from chicklet keys to a more traditional keyboard cap design which was unexpected and amazing!!! Props to Cooler Master as I wasn't aware they would do this and wasn't expecting to see this! Bonus points to Cooler Master as I have purchased many items from them over the years and was again impressed by this decision they made when they didn't have to! Very Awesome and it made me want to write a glowing review in their honor!  :)Added after reviewing the item page: FYI - It is advertised with 2 sets of key caps! This wasn't expected as I read early review articles on this device from review outlets and I don't think this was originally a thing... this shows me Cooler Master listened to the feedback in the newer model SK 652 and decided to include key caps to buyers of this SK 650 model I think... cheers!",
          "Looks honestly great, they have a pretty wide variety of RGB colors too so that was nice. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me is that it is a tiny bit harder to type on than most keyboards. But honestly, a really good purchase that I don't regret.",
          "I bought this board for the switches and I'm happy with it.  I quite like linears and love low-profile keyboards, and the board doesn't disappoint on both counts.  They aren't the lowest profile switches out there, however they do support normal MX keycaps mostly.  Unfortunately they use custom stabilizers so you aren't switching out the space bar easily.  It's also a beautiful board, if you like the look of chiclet keys.  Unfortunately the keycaps aren't fantastic to type on.  The chicklet keycaps have too small of a gutter between them and without any chamfering I found myself frequently  pressing two keys at once.  I wound up switching out the letters with a more normal set of keycaps.  Interestingly the new keycaps are at the same level as the chiclets, so the design isn't to reduce the height.Overall it's a great board, but you might have to get used to the chiclet keycaps or swap them out.  Get it for the keyswitches, though, there aren't many boards out there with these.",
          "I was waiting for this keyboard to go down in price for so long and at around $60-70 I feel that is warranted. However, does anyone even keep the standard flat keys?The package shipped promptly and already came with the alternate keycaps which I have to say, never have I ever changed those out so quickly with the alternatives. What everyone is saying about how the flat keys can be an uncomfortable and error ridden typing experience is true. Because they're all flat and clustered together, you will more likely than not type an additional letter by mistake. Swap them out, don't look back (props to CM for including them and listening to feedback). Because the keys are a bit closer together than other keyboards I still find myself accidentally hitting certain keys on accident but I'm sure I'll get used to it.The keyboard itself is very sleek. Low profile compared to a standard mechanical but still a bit taller than other keyboards. The chassis is well built with chamfered edges and still lightweight. The typing experience (once keys are changed) is pretty comfortable minus one thing; there's no kickstand. Even the most basic membrane keyboard will have kickstands on the back to angle the keyboard even a little. This one, does not so you might need a wristpad and something to place underneath the keyboard if you're used to that.As far as the keys and volume its a very quiet keyboard. Great for typists and a bit of gaming. If you're a heavy typer you may hear a bit of \"twanginess\" but definitely not as bad as other low profile keyboards I've played with. Lighting can get BRIGHT, but fortunately you can change the colors to your liking with RGB and different brightness/intensity settings. No dedicated media keys but you can use them with the function key.Overall good solid and aesthetically pleasing keyboard. Definitely buy it while it's on sale since at best, I'd have to say its a midrange board to play with.",
          "I love this keyboard. I love the responsiveness of the keys and the feel of them as I use it. Some people have mentioned issues with the key spacing and flatness of the key caps, and I would have to disagree with all of that. I can understand where they may be coming from if they\u2019re not used to flat key caps but the keys are a perfect distance and I have no issues maintaining my typing speeds and my Im game reaction time. If you\u2019re not used to flat keys there will be an adjustment, or if you have larger hands you may have issues with this I could see, but many mechanical keyboards are spaced way too far for me to use them effectively. With my small hands this keyboard is perfect. It\u2019s nearly silent and the linear switches are so smooth, with their expected lack of feedback and click. This is exactly what I was looking for. The lighting controls are easy to use. The one thing I would say is the compatible software that is apparently \u201cavailable but not needed\u201d is difficult to track down, I spent a few hours after getting this keyboard and have yet to find it. I personally would rather use a software to program my devices then built in, just because it helps me see it better, but that\u2019s just a personal preference. It\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous piece of equipment and functions so well from what I can do far.",
          "Great keeb ruined by bad keycaps and strange double input registering. Switches can feel stiff.Switches: My first time using MX linear switches, they were okay, they had a decent amount of scratchiness and stiffness.  I have tried low profile kaih choc switches and they're much nicer. But it's still nice to use a board where the switches activate quickly without much pre-travelLooks: Stunning with white keycaps+RGB. Brushed aluminum just makes it look that extra. I was sent the wrong color (white) by accident, but now I realize the keyboard should be bought white, because the RGB looks so amazing and saturated with the white keycaps.Keycaps: The flat chiclet keys provided are trash, the keeb is unusable without swapping to the alternate provided keycaps. There's a weird powdery residue feel to the chiclet keycaps. This is fixed by using the more standard low profile keycaps with cylindrical contact surfaces for your fingers, but they feel glossy and sticky. This is the worst part about this keyboard. They seem like coated ABS with lasered off legendsTyping Performance: I don't know if it was because of the switches but it felt like the keys were sticky and stiff. This is likely a combination of the stiff switches and the poor quality keycaps that stick to your fingers as you're touch typingI should have known to expect problems after receiving the wrong color keyboard. However, the white keycaps complemented beautifully with the bright RGB, so I decided to stick with the keyboard. Then the keyboard started to register double presses with the k and g keys. The last straw",
          "PSA: I RMA'd my device and currently waiting for it, so I'll update this review after a few months of using the new and non-faulty device. Will attach images then. I'll probably change this to 5* when I get the replacement KB and if my 2 issues are gone (info below)I upgraded from my old Steelseries Apex 360, which is a low-profile membrane KB. Keys are harder to press, mostly due to being oldSo I appeared to receive a defective product from the following: (1) Duplicate keys (likke thiisss), and (2) Non-responsive keys. I ordered this KB on 7/10/21, and contacted CM Support on 8/12/21. CM Support has been very generous and helpful. My RMA application was approved, and so my faulty KB is currently on the wayIgnoring my faulty KB, so far here is what I love:1. Extremely easy to clean. If you look at pictures, the keys aren't sitting inside the board, but on top, so junk doesn't get stuck inside the board. Keys are very easy to pop off. Just get a can of air compressor, and it's instantly clean. USBC cable is also detachable from the KB base, so you don't have to unplug it from the PC end and un-cable manage the whole thing2. Surprisingly quiet and light keys for a mech kb. (cherry mx low profile) I was always hesitant to get a mechanical keyboard because I never liked being loud when typing. This keyboard genuinely surprised me regarding this3. Material. Soft, firm, definitely not cheap feel. Keys physically feel great, and the board is such a nice, sleek, brushed aluminum material4. RGB lights both on the keys and under the keys, are very nice, and overall quite bright (good)5. Compared to my previous KB, SS Apex 350: Smaller than what I had, so more space on my desk, even with the fullsize version of this CM kb. Also no more excessive macro keys, though a few would've been nice. More space efficient. Spacebar isn't jank. Better RGB customization on the physical kb. No external software needed, but if I want to use it, it works nicelyDownsides so far:1. There's no back feet to prop up the KB higher. This is pretty significant but not enough to not buy it. Only takes away from my experience a little bit. Still surprised about this one2. No dedicated macros on the KB but that's okay, more of a luxury, not a necessity for me specificallyUPDATE AFTER USING RMA'D DEVICE FOR MONTHS: Experience has been fantastic & it works perfectly. Support was also very good. Changed 4* to 5* rating. I actually got to have the SK652 board with the SK650 keycaps, so now I also have back feet",
          "I like this keyboard. DISCLAIMER I bought the \"used like new\" option. I think if I bought the new version, it would have been what I wanted, I'm guessing. I really like the way it feels to type. It feels kind of soft, not super clicky like another mechanical keyboard I had. I am really thinking about keeping this keyboard and not returning it, but I just can't keep dealing with how it actually works.As I am typing, sometimes, I type a double d or a ddouble space. (I'm going to leave the double d at the beginning of the word ddouble because it just happened there.... and it also just happened again on that secondd double. Actually I'm going to leave it like that every time it happens for the rest of this review instead of going back an fixing it just so you can see how often it happens.)I specifically got this keyboardd because it was pretty cheap andd I wantedd the flat key caps. I didn't want the tradditional curve-shaped ones, I was going to switch it out for the flat ones if it came with the curved ones on it. Lo and behold, it came with the curved ones on it, but DID NOT come with the replacement set of flat key caps that the listing says it should come with. Not only that, but I noticed that the key I'm having the most trouble with ddoing that double press thing, is actually a flat key cap... when the rest are the regular style.I would love to just ignore everything and keep typing on this keyboard because the overall experience feels much nicer than the cheap razer cynosa chroma that I got at walmart like 3 years ago - which has been acting as a back up keyboard in case I need one, and that's the one I've been needing to use lately. However, I can't keep this keyboard. I would have MAYBE tried to deal with the double dd thing - maybe if I type slower or something it won't happen - but I can't sit here and look at this keyboard with the wonky looking d key and be okay with that. And if it already has typing issues, I may as well not buy new key caps and just return it an get an entirely different keyboard.I guess that's what I get for trying to be cheap lol.",
          "It is a great keyboard if looking for low profile quiet mechanical keys. Only thing I can complain about is that there is not flip out or magnetic feet on the back for that additional incline of the keys. Feels flat even with the angle design it has and the extra angle helps. Ended up buying a acrylic stand for the keyboard to solve my only issue.",
          "\u00a0Update at the bottom.I really like the flat keys personally. I didn't have too much trouble with miskeying like a lot of other people reported. One problem I have experienced is that often a key would repeat a character. I am typing on it now and will leave in typos sso you can see. \"S\" often repeats. I adjusted the repeat delay and repeat rate in the keyboard properties and that seemed to help a bit, but it still happens. Not the end of the world, but kind of annoying. It sometimes happenss with E as well. I haven't noticed any problems playing games with WASD. It could be the way I am typing (I have a heavy ring finger?? lol)I haven't switched to the other keycaps, but it is nice that it comess with an extra sset in case you don't like the flat style.The RGB is a little tricky to figure out since it is just controlled with key commands instead of a software program, but there are some neat effects you can play with.I included a video so you can see how it sounds. It isssn't super clacky; it makes more of a thud/click sound. It isn't super loud either.Overall I think it is a great keyboard for the money. It looks sleek, and not goofy like ssome of the other RGB gaming keyboards.UPDATE: I cleaned with air duster and took the key cap off and put it back on to see if that would help and it seems like the s repeat issue is fixed!",
          "The keyboard has everything you'd expect and a solid build. Good switches, quiet, full size functionality, very good RGB customization, good material choice, braided detachable cable, minimal design.The one thing that people may need to get used to is the spacing and flat keycaps. I came from a laptop and chiclet bluetooth keyboard so using flat keycaps with tight spacing was no bother to me but I have seen people complain about it. Luckily with amazon you have time to return it, so if you dont like the feel fresh out the box give yourself a week or two before deciding.",
          "If you want low profile switches, this keyboard is perfect. It is completely flat, with very short actuation distance on the keys, which is great for gaming and fast typing. Key switches are also nice and smooth linear switches, with a decent sound. RGB is ok, not the best colors but the software is also nice.",
          "Its a great keyboard overall with a nice case and sounds really nice but my only complaint it that it feels scratchy and now the arrow keys are starting to squeak whenever i use them but that might just be because i use them a lot. Overall its sounds amazing and looks amazing the rgb looks amazing and bright",
          "Great keyboard! I don't understand all the complaints. I have been using this keyboard since December 2021 and it's been wonders. I really like that you can detach the cord from both ends too AND its USB C which is a plus. Would recommend!",
          "The keyboard LOOKS great and has a very satisfying key strike sound.  There are so many modes for the LEDs that you will never run out of options for whatever suits your mood.  It's a bit hard to just unpack the keyboard and go, but the instructions are clear on how to get the different options and such.  My main qualm with this keyboard is how high the keys are.  They're around 7/16in tall from they keyboard base, and it seems to be spaced out and high enough (even for my long fingers) to miskey a LOT.  I have very, very good accuracy with typing, and this keyboard has definitely lowered that.  I have not yet tried the traditional keys because I wanted the colors to really show.  If you are using this for JUST gaming, it might be a problem as well if you strike the wrong key.  I use this keyboard for both office and gaming and have been using for about a month and a half now.  Overall, looks great, maybe not quite a functional as my other keyboards.",
          "I had been using a keyboard with full sized key caps and very sensitive triggers for too long. I couldn\u2019t adapt to it and couldn\u2019t type on it at all. So I finally hit the bullet and got myself another low profile keyboard.At first the SK650 was fantastic. It had the feel I was looking for without a ton of extra and unnecessary features.Then the problems started. The keyboard started registering 2, 3, sometimes 4 inputs of a character.  I was spending more time correcting typos for things I legitimately didn\u2019t mistype than I was on my last keyboard. The A only triggers about 60% of the time as well.I looked around online and found quite a few other users reporting the same problem with this model. It seemed to be the most consistent issue. So I contacted Cooler Master support. As one would expect, they jumped straight to RMA. Now I wouldn\u2019t mind an RMA normally, but I couldn\u2019t get a response from CM that this underlying problem had actually been addressed. What I didn\u2019t want was to end up receiving another faulty unit.Well, don\u2019t worry, I never completed the RMA anyway, because it got a whole lot worse.As part of the process of an RMA, the faulty unit needs to be returned. Most companies send you the replacement and allow you to return the faulty unit in the RMA shipping package. Cooler Master does things different. You are expected to ship the faulty unit to them BEFORE they will dispatch the replacement. You are also responsible for paying for the shipping to send it to them.This is where it gets ULTRA FUN! You\u2019ve sent Cooler Master your keyboard. Now you don\u2019t have a keyboard! Your only real option is to\u2026\u2026 BUY a different keyboard to use while you wait for your RMA.So now you have purchased the keyboard, paid to have it shipped back to Cooler Master, and bought another keyboard to use in the interim. You could have spent that money on a better product from the get go.But wait, now we circle back to that fact about Cooler Master not acknowledging the problem. You may still end up with the same problem with the replacement keyboard. So you may end up having to buy a better keyboard anyway.I definitely don\u2019t advise buying this product.I\u2019m personally not buying another peripheral device from Cooler Master ever again. They need to stick to cooling products.",
          "As mentioned in the title, in less than a year of owning this keyboard, one of the key switches broke",
          "Pros:-- Huge range of RGB effects and precise color controls.-- Internal memory for RGB settings means settings are retained when switching OS, booting, etc.-- RGB effect looks great on the brushed metal, and illuminates keycaps well.-- Responsive switches-- Easy cleaning with keycaps removedCons:-- Close-packed keycaps with no beveling and relatively large travel distance plus high sensitivity on these red switches makes accuracy a bit of an issue. Lots of accidental keystrokes at first, but better with practice.-- Typing surface is pretty high (1 in.) off the table, you might want a wrist-rest just to get a better angle.-- The switches are pretty wigglyThe RGB effects are great on this model but there are some mechanical issues. I think the accuracy issues could be solved cheaply with keycaps that offer a bit more room between keys. You could also solve the issue with clicky switches. It's a good keyboard for the price.",
          "The keys are have a good amount of sensibility but the space bar is specially way too sensible to the point of activating it without meaning to do so if you lay your finger on it.I bought a refurbished one and it works perfectly although the keys on the board they sent weren't the flats ones which are in the image on Amazon.The RGB is very good, it has a lot of different modes and most of them are really beautiful and you can always adjust the intensity of the lights.",
          "This keyboard is an absolutely stunning piece of equipment but it does come with some caveats. I purchased the ten-keyless version which means it doesn't come with the number pad.Let me tell you about the pros first. The keyboard is beautiful. The Led backlighting is completely cutomizable with the Cooler Master software. Although I wouldn't consider it to be \"low profile\" the keyboard is lower than most keyboards. The switches themselves feel good. They are completely silent aside from when the key bottoms out. The keyboard is very compact and the spacing between keys is low to make it a bit smaller. I purchased the ten-keyless version so I have plenty of space on my desk due to its compact nature. The keyboard is also very sturdy with an aluminum brushed top finish.Now for the cons. Like I stated previously, the keys are very close together. This allows the keyboard to looks fantastic however this means that if you have bigger fingers it's very easy to press more than one key. I personally like the keys being closer but there is a pretty steep learning curve because of this. The keyboard also doesn't come with adjustable feet so if you like your keyboards slightly elevated you will need to use another item to prop it up.Aside from this the keyboard is great. The setup is extremely simply however it's not too clear where to get the software for the added customization. Once you figure that out though, the software is easy to use, even with support for macros. The keyboard uses a Type-C to USB cable which is great for travelling if you have an Android device which let's you take one less cable. The keyboard also comes with a nice travel bag out of the box which is very convenient.I wouldn't have bought this keyboard knowing this learning curve existed however I have it now and I quite enjoy it. I hope this helped someone deciding whether or not to buy this keyboard.",
          "-1/2 star for it get hot on the base around the arrow keys and CTRL key-1/2 star for wobbly keys, they work, they are just a little wobbly, the space bar is really wobbly (did not try they traditional key caps)-1/2 star for you have to turn up the back lighting really bright to see the shift/function labels of the keys-1/2 star for the \"brushed aluminum\" finish on the base is the worlds worst dust magnetI do wish it had legs to stand up the top/back of the keyboard more so it didn't lay so flatBut it's a shorter stroke keyboard, came with both \"traditional\" key caps and chicklet/flat/mac key caps, can set to one solid color without software and without losing key functionality (looking at you red dragon keyboards), it's white, and it has a nice small foot print while keeping all the keys including the number pad and the cable disconnects at the keyboard too making running the cable around easy peasy.",
          "I have quite a collection of mechanicals.  I stay away from blue keys, anything clicky.. I've always gravitated toward the solid feel of brown switches and recently purchased some of the MX Silver (speed) switches.  Browns were exhausting at by the end of the day.  Silver are way to sensitive for my heavy hands.  I had tried Reds before, but never these LP Reds... Love them.As for construction, keycaps are great material with a nice soft touch.. ever so slightly concave caps fit my fingertips, rgb lighting is beautiful and relatively easy to program. Solid heavy frame with a brushed metal finish and beveled edges.  Removable USB-C cable included is 6ft and braided.  Includes cap puller.Very happy.  I just purchased the SK630 for my server rack as it will fit without 10Key.",
          "Given the linear switches, it can be easy to accidentally press a button while idle in a game.My model's cable hole (for detachable cable) wiggles a little but that's probably due to it being ordered as open-box.",
          "The first thing i wanna say is that this keyboard is stunning especially when the RGB is on full display, the keyboard is TKL and the frame is practically non-existant so this keyboard is super compact. The build quality is above average and it feels really nice and premium. despite all the some-what negative youtube reviews i still bough into this keyboard because of its looks and i was willing to give it a shot no matter what because i just had to have this on my desk but after 1 whole day i just could not bear with it and returned it.My problem is that the keys on this keyboard are waay to short my fingers and i felt cramping within the half of my first match of BFV to the point i just stopped playing. Also, the keys are flat and to this i said that i don't mind since i use other flat keys like magic keyboard from apple but this was just horrible, i could just not type with this keyboard i could not get a grip of what keys my hands were hovering over since everything just felt flat across the board and i made a mistake every time i went to write something and lost my sence of location everytime i my hands left a key. This keyboard is not for anyone with medium to large hands. They say there is a learning curve to this keyboard but trust me when i say that this is not a fun curve to learn at all and this is coming from someone who ignorantly ignored all the negativity on reviews and still went and got it. If you got tiny hands or are a child this may prob work for you but that's just my opinion.",
          "This is a slim and sleek professional looking keyboard. Something you can own without making you appear like a nerd gamer. This is the few keyboards at the moment that uses the cherry mx low profile REDS which are new. These switches feel absolutely fantastic - they're quiet and have no bottoming out.  The travel distance of the low profile red (3.2 mm) is a little smaller than a traditional red switch (4 mm) which makes it feel more smooth to type on. If you're a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, this will fit right into your collection as an \"end game\" keyboard. It is so different from other mechanical keyboards that it's refreshing to experience something new for a change.Pros:-Aesthetically pleasing, minimal design-Switches are quiet-lots of lighting and effects customization via software-linear switches so they have no bottoming out. It is very satisfying to type on for a long time, no \"finger fatigue\" that you get from other switches like the cherry mx bluesCons:-Space bar has a loud metal rattling sound. Typing on a normal key sounds like a \"ping\" but the space bar sounds like a \"clink\". This happens when the base that holds the metal stabilizer is not tight enough and there is too much room so the stabilizer makes a clinking sound when the space bar is pressed down. I inserted small pieces of cotton balls under the stabilizer to fix this problem. This also occurs in the backspace, enter, and right shift key. This was a big problem for me because it was so loud and noticeable, but this problem is fixable.-no height adjustment - This actually isn't a problem for me since I prefer it low, but a lot of people need this and should be included any modern keyboard.",
          "The keyboard is built somewhat cheaply, and for the price I expected a better build quality.  The keys themselves feel very good, but actuate WAY too early, and are very light to press to begin with, resulting in a lot of typos and accidental key presses.  Still, you get a spare set of keycaps which is nice... if you like very light touch keyboards for a premium, this is a good bet.",
          "I'm loving this keyboard.Pro's:Looks and feels very nice.The RGB backlighting is great looking but the controls are a bit confusing, I set it up with the portal software and haven't touched it since.Con's:The flat keycaps take a bit to get used to. Even after getting used to it, I'm hitting extra keys more often than on a keyboard with beveled keycaps, but it's not terrible.I took off one star because I had to buy a stand, it's idiotic that cooler master did not build one in.My other nitpick is that the keys are very easy to accidentally press, the actuation point is pretty shallow and there's not much weight to the keys.",
          "My daily driver at home is a Logitech G815 with Romer-G Low-Profile Tactiles. I maintain separate incidentals for personal and work devices. (There are reasons for this, but it\u2019s not relevant here.)Given that I refuse to risk my precious G815 by plugging it into that network like some kind of monster, I needed a new keyboard for work. It needed to be inexpensive enough to sacrifice if necessary (flashing firmware has worked so far, but I don\u2019t bet on it), wired, good enough to take a beating, low-profile, as quiet as possible, and at least semi-enjoyable to work with. I gave preference to backlit boards because I work in a room lit only by lots of bright screens.This seemed like it would fit the bill. I bought it renewed because it was only about $40 and I didn\u2019t know for sure if it would work. No regrets. It\u2019s by far the best keyboard I\u2019ve ever had for work. It lit up a nice solid purple color & I haven\u2019t wanted to change it or make any new lighting effects yet. I\u2019ll update if there are any issues when I give that a go. I\u2019m also replacing some keycaps today & will update if something unexpected happens.In my line of work, seconds can matter at times. This board doesn\u2019t get in my way. I\u2019m faster on it, in fact, because I only need to press a tiny bit to actuate. I can also rest my fingers on the keys just fine without actuating.I\u2019m not bothering with any board-specific macro recordings. Autohotkey works for just about everything.It\u2019s basically silent & the low profile reds are about as close to a tactile feel as I\u2019ve been able to get out of a linear switch (but it\u2019s still definitely linear.) I bought this with more consideration for sound than feel, but I don\u2019t hate the feel. It\u2019s softer than I\u2019d like, but that same softness helps me maintain a consistent typing speed without fatigue for hours on end. It\u2019s a great \u201cendurance\u201d keyboard.If you don\u2019t bottom out your keys or slam your hands into the thing, you won\u2019t have any problems. And it\u2019s oh-so-quiet. My coworkers often don\u2019t notice me coming in, unloading my stuff (we hotdesk), and starting work. It\u2019s light enough that it doesn\u2019t add any noticeable weight to my backpack. The velvet carrying case & dual-ended USB is a nice touch. Perfect for anyone who has to drag everything on their desk to and from work every day.I love this thing and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t let the bad reviews dissuade me. For anyone with experience doing things that require higher-that-average fine motor skills (fiddly types of craftwork, drawing, surgery) this should not be a problem. I suspect that type of experience may be why I\u2019m having a really easy time with this thing, anyway.Tl; dr: I can still type really fast. Absolutely love it. It\u2019s basically silent if you don\u2019t bottom out your keys. That said, I have higher-than-average fine motor skills so your mileage may vary.",
          "The build qualtiy is very good. Lot of thought put into lighiting. Keystrokes are kinda silent and it feels like the keys are rubbing their way down instead of a click. The flat keys arent that great as it feels like your hands are all over the keys instead of on a specific key. Need a bit of time to get used to compared to normally spaced keys",
          "This keyboard is absolutely beautiful to look at. The keys, baseplate and lighting are visually stunning and the minimalist design is clean. I drooled over this keyboard...until I actually used it. The cherry mx red switches are sensitive and very light to the touch providing no tactile feedback other than bottoming out. That combined with the tight key spacing makes this setup prone to stray keystrokes. After my first cup of Joe in the morning it seems like a nice setup but as the day wears on and I tire, the tight, sensitive keys start to show the faults in this design. Smoothest, best looking keyboard I have ever owned but sadly it will be moved to second string status due to tight key spacing. Also this is not a low profile board even though it uses low profile switches. Overall key height is about the same as all my other full size keyboards. Not necessarily a bad thing but if you truly want a low profile board, this isn't it. Switches and keycaps are not easily replaceable (most of keycaps can be swapped but not all as stabilizers are not standard) so this keyboard is what it is.",
          "This is the most expensive keyboard I have ever purchased and also the worst keyboard I have ever purchased. I have 10 dollar keyboards that out perform and have been much more reliable than this piece of junk. If you like a company that is easy to contact and get support from then Coolermaster is not for you. Go ahead and call their US support number (888-624-5099) right now and choose 1 for customer support. You will get an automated response \"Thank you for calling CoolerMaster support, we appologize we cannot take your call at this moment. Our office hours are Monday thru Friday 9:00am thru 5:00pm pacific standard time. We may be on the line helping someone else out at the......moment of your call. Please attempt to call us back after some time has passed during our normal business hours, thank you.\"Then it just hangs up.  I have tried for two days.I have also tried the Fan zone and it was recommended to update the firmware and I did that and it's just as bad if not worse. When you try to leave a new comment in the support ticket and submit your new comment will not show up.The keyboard frequently double types several characters and randomly double spaces when using the space bar.I would never have bought it, but my son wanted it for his birthday because of the RGB lighting.Now that I see how hard it is to deal with their customer service I will never ever buy another CoolerMaster product in my life. I can deal with getting a lemon, that is not the problem. The problem for me comes down to customer service. If I could just speak with a real human being and get this worked out I would gladly consider a future product purchase. Buyer beware.I wish I could give it zero stars because their customer support options are a big fat zero.",
          "The typing experience on this keyboard is top notch. The cherry red low profile switches have a slightly scratchy feel that is pleasant. I also think the quality of the keyboard build is superb minus that it is a little lightweight which I feel makes it feel a little cheap sometimes but when it is sitting there on your desk looking pretty and not moving because it has nice solid rubber feet on the bottom you dont care about the weight!The main issue is... I need MacOS keycaps and it is driving me CRAZY!!!! I wish I could fully suggest it to other Mac users but this has been so annoying for me. I have looked for solutions online with no results.",
          "I really like this keyboard. It\u2019s one of the sleekest TKL keyboards I\u2019ve seen on the market. The RGB lighting is great, with over 20+ features available. Build quality is pretty good, except for the cheap plastic plate on the bottom. Other than that, the brushed aluminum upper case and key caps feel great. The keys are a bit close together, which can make typing a bit hard at first, but you get used to it, just like any other keyboard.I hope they can improve the quality of the bottom plate and add adjustable legs to customize the keyboard angle in future models.Great for gaming. I\u2019ve had no issues playing the new Modern Warfare. Great keyboard overall, but not perfect. I\u2019d recommend trying it out, but it isn\u2019t for everyone.",
          "I love the feel of this keyboard since I no longer have to stab into my keyboard to press keys while keeping that linear non-clicky feel. The only problem is that the keys have some sort of chattering issue that comes about over long usage. I\u2019ve had to clean the keys with isopropyl alcohol MANY times just to keep the keyboard usable. If it weren\u2019t for the really bad quality control for the high price, this keyboard would be fantastic. I still find the end product worth it in its uniquely comfortable and quick feel though."

          "My gosh...if anyone is reading this just do yourself a favor and buy these. I was kind of hesitant to buy a headset from CM but after reading up on them I decided to try them out. Before these I had the Arctis 7 and 1 which both sounded terrible so I ended up returning them. I also tried the new Logitech G pro which was good for music, but for FPS games they weren't that great. I was about to go with the HyperX but I'm glad I didn't. These are super comfortable and the built quality is above average. The sound quality is what's most important and these sound WAY better then all the stuff I tested. I listen to a lot of deep house/ hiphop and play a lot of competitive csgo and cod for fun so sound quality is important for me. These right out of the box blew everything I tried out the water. Only thing is that I'm not a fan of the CM software but straight out the box sounded the best so don't even bother with the software. It's hard to find good cans since everyone has their own taste but I can assure you that for this price range, it's the best out there. So stop wasting your time deciding which to get because it doesn't get better than these.",
          "UPDATE:So, after less than a year I have a headset that has broken in the same weak spot on both sides (repaired one side with glue, the other decided to break days later). I would understand if I was particularly rough with this headset... but I'm not.As far as I can tell this is likely due to the large size of my head which puts stress on the flimsy plastic where the metal headband ends.I would give it one star, but I'm fairly certain if you don't have an aberrantly large head it will probably last longer. Still, it's a weak spot in the design, and I would be careful when handling it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:They're comfortable and the noise cancellation works very well. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality seems good to me.There is a major flaw on the software side. At least on Windows 10, though I would imagine this would apply to other operating systems. Whenever these lose their wireless connection, the audio device itself is disconnected completely. This alone is a serious irritant if you have multiple audio devices, since it'll end up swapping over to one of them. However, this becomes an even bigger problem because the headset itself will fail to reconnect properly and require turning it off, removing the USB dongle, then plugging it back in, and then turning on the headset again before it will work properly. Add in waiting for a few seconds for the connection to actually start transmitting audio and you're looking at spending a half of a minute to reconnect.There doesn't even seem to be any kind of significant delay before disconnecting happens, either, so I've gotten into situations where the headset connects and then disconnects rapidly until the firmware on the headset crashes. It's easy enough to turn it off and back on again, but then you're stuck with the above problem.To make matters worse, the connectivity of this headset is subpar. It is particularly annoying since having the microwave running in the kitchen is enough to disrupt the connection even when I'm in the adjacent room sitting directly beside my computer. I didn't have these problems with my previous headset, so it's not just that my microwave is insanely disruptive.All of this is a shame because the headset has been great otherwise, but make sure you intend to keep them right in front of your computer at all times.",
          "I've been using a Turtle Beach Stealth 450 Wireless headset for a few  years and it started to go bad over the past few weeks, so I'll be comparing this headset to the Stealth 450Sound Quality - Both headsets give really good sound quality, but the MH670 edges out just a little in quality.Mic quality - I haven't used the mic much, but both are nice detachable mics that are bendy.  And people I talk to can't tell much of a difference.Battery Life - I can't comment on this just yet because I haven't really gotten a feel of the battery life of the MH670 yet.Quality - the Stealth 450 does feel a bit higher quality here.  It isn't a huge difference in quality though.Comfort - this is where the MH670 excels, especially for people who wear glasses.  I don't feel a lot of pressure with the sides of my glasses squeezing my head as opposed to the 450.  The MH670 wins this hands down.Range - The MH670 works better with range. Both have good range if there isn't anything breaking line of sight, but the connection stays clearer even when walking around the house and going upstairs wearing the MH670. This was the biggest issue I had with the 450.Button Layout - the 450 has a slightly better and intuitive set of buttons for power, mute, and volumes.Software - the Turtle Beach software is pretty nice, it gives a ton of options where as the MH670 doesn't really have any software.  But the TB app can eat up some resources at times.Overall, I recommend this if you want a decent gaming headset that is wireless, especially if you are like me and wear glasses.  I'm really happy with the purchase.",
          "Ordered these headphones last the end of last November.  Since then I have been generally satisfied that is until today.  The plastic that joins the metal band to the swiveling bracket that holds the left headphone just cracked out of no where.  The was no dropping of the headphones, no damage from outside sources just normal day to day use.  \"But wait! there is a one year warranty!\" you may cry.  but ah...the fine people at cooler master have made that potentially impossible to claim.  First you must register your account and your product to even file a support ticket.  Though annoying that is understandable.  but there is a trick.  The registration of your account hinges on an activation email....that they never send.  then after some digging i was able to find a customer support number after calling...i kid you not.... 15 times they never answer.  what a great loophole they've found.  attract customers with a great warranty and then avoid any potential costs by making said warranty unclaimable.  aside from that the mic quaility leaves much to be desired.  overall i'd advise you to find something better",
          "si los usas por m\u00e0s de una hora producen dolor de cabeza, no gasten su dienro en este headset mejor vayan por unos hyperx, aparte se sienten construidos con materiales de extremada mala calidad",
          "When purchasing this headset, It was advertised that the sound and microphone quality were excellent. When receiving this, not only was the audio quality bad, but the microphone stopped working after one week. When the microphone did work the first week, friends I was gaming with online said I sounded unrecognizable and far away. Also the software CoolerMaster encourages you to download has no options for testing sound quality. I returned this product, and opted for a SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless gaming headset. I am very happy with this new headset in all aspects, and I encourage anyone looking for a budget wireless gaming headset to buy the SteelSeries headset. When it comes to CoolerMaster, stick to buying their PSU's",
          "I purchased this headset roughly 5 months ago and I upgraded from the Corsair Void Pro USB. I wanted to take a leap into the Wireless space because I have heard many good things.So to start this headset when wired, sounds great. If you use the Windows Equalizer and not the CoolerMaster software's equalizer, you have decent customization. The headset isn't the most comfortable but with the occasional readjustment I can wear it for a couple hours.Even in wireless mode the benefit I saw was the range, I enjoyed walking across nearly my house and grabbing food with this headset.But really the Wired benefits is all I can praise with this headset.While wired the microphone given with the headset does not work in tandem with one cable. Which is fine if you have a secondary/usb mic for better quality.When in wireless mode the audio quality was okay, however with louder noises or higher pitched ones, it got a little painful and screechy. The only way I could fix this is by going back to wired.So this headset is amazing if you need a headset for your phone, as it comes with a type-c adapter, or if you don't mind using your wireless headset in wired mode all the time.",
          "I absolutely love these headphones, however they are too heavy on my head. I feel it pulling at my hair on the top, to the point where I fear I may go bald :(",
          "Not much to say, picked up headset off desk, and it broke. 1 month outside of warranty.A bit uncomfortable for prolonged gaming, but good noise cancellation.",
          "The audio quality is good. People did not complain when in discord. The main problem is that I purchased 2 of these 6 months apart. They did not last a year. The failing point on both was the same spot. The 2 plastic pieces that clamp the top to the bottom side of the headphones where they turn broke.I do not have pets, nor little kids that could have damaged them. I have crossed off these headphones off as a future purchase. Unfortunately, its passed their return policy.",
          "In terms of sound quality these are fine, and worked well enough for my uses (gaming + music). They're pretty big headphones, and even though the headband has a cushion on it the headset can still be very  uncomfortable after long periods of use. The main issue is these would have terrible connection issues if I used them for more than a couple of hours. Like the headset would disconnect, reconnect, and then disconnect again a couple of minutes later. This wouldn't really bother me if the time it took to connect was minuscule, but it takes long enough and lags my computer to the point where I can't do anything else until it reconnects. First couple times this started happening I sent my headset in for an RMA but the new headset they sent back had the exact same problems. Unless you won't be using this headset for more than an hour at a time, I really wouldn't recommend it.",
          "I purchased this for my wife and she been using it since christmas. Now she has an alienware m17, which I gave to her since I don't use it anymore. She overall love bass in any headphones and the eq from the cooler master app is amazing thing for her. She can adjust whatever her heart desire. She does wish the vocals were somewhat louder or clearer on certain songs but that could be the producer part.Comfort - she also have the hyperx flight (qi charge verison) she love the comfort on it but comparing to the coolermaster, the thick earpads is little much for her BUT she did get used to it and got more comfortable afterwards.Mic- from what i hear, the mic sounds amazing but does require for you to go in the app and increase the mic, unless you can speak loud enough for the mic to output the voice for the other person to hear, otherwise, increase the mic volume. FOR THE CONSOLE PLAYERS, we both have the ps5 and she tried plug and play but the only downside is, the mic pick up a lot of outside noise, i can speak low and it somehow pick up my voice, anything you do, it will pick up the noise, the settings in the app doesnt save to the headset when unplug and plug into another device. (I assume this issue can be happening on mobile or on the switch, since it has a usb c dongle)Overall she love the headset and could be her favorite headset for gaming and music (on pc)",
          "Muy buen sonido para jugar, pero luego de 30 minutos te comienza a dolar el cuello y la cabeza por el peso que tienen",
          "The headset does a really good job for low tone songs and bass but at higher pitch noises, it noticeably lacking but barely. Still great first wireless headset for the price",
          "the sound and connectivity of this headset was terrific. However, after only 3 months, the left earpiece screws at the hinge just blew out due to the plastic holes that they screw in to breaking. No way to fix this without new plastic parts. I babied these things. These are no marks on them. They've never been dropped. This tells me the plastic screw hole piece was prob faulty from over tightening or something.Sad about this because I really liked this headset. The sound was great.",
          "My initial thoughts on the headset for the price was it is a nice headset, comfortable, and the overall sound quality and mic quality is great.  For a wireless headset at this price point it is a good deal. However, after only 6 months of use, it broke ( as seen in the pictures above ) No damage to the headset via dropping or misuse. Just was wearing them, went to adjust the headset and then the right earpiece felt lose, when I took them off of my head pieces fell off and well see the pictures.  It is unfortunate because I did like them, but honestly if this is the normal with them. I cannot recommend it.",
          "Very comfortable and good sound. One minor negative is the mic on/off is a button which is hard to tell if in or out without looking whereas my previous set had a slide switch which i knew was up for off/down for on, AND when you talk into this mike you cannot hear it yourself - I recommend considering this small detail if you are using for work calls so you know if you are on or off (without using the computer mike control).",
          "While these did have the benefit of being wireless, relatively cheap, and it actually made me smile when I put it on for the first time, the mic is very muffled and poor quality while the bass is very absent",
          "This headset has it all, great sound quality, great microphone quality and a great wireless range. I will never buy another headset brand again",
          "Buena calidad de entrega y producto, en excelentes condiciones y absolutamente acorde con lo que venden. Microfono excelente y audio espectacular.",
          "It's pretty decent for sound quality, but the built quality is really bad. I've only had it for 6 months and the plastic between the headband and earpiece broke, making it unusable. I tried glueing it back together because they are my only pair. Left side snapped and the right side is cracking. For the price of these headphones, they shouldn't be doing this....",
          "I got a headset that stopped working after two weeks of use (it started shocking my ears and turning off and on non stop), contacted the seller and requested the replacement. They happily sent a \u201cnew headset\u201d but the new headset was dirty and with visible signs of use and wouldn\u2019t even turn on. They clearly disposed a broken headset that somebody returned to them sending it as a replacement. While I was waiting for the replacement I lost an opportunity to send the item back and get the guaranteed refund, so I spent last 3 weeks In a power struggle between Amazon and the third party being told \u201cwe sent a message on your behalf, allow seller 48 hours to respond\u201d over and over again every time I try to ask for a refund or even get an a to z guarantee. When I filed the return request seller did not respond until I filed a claim and Amazon made them respond to me.Terrible seller that sells defective items, don\u2019t buy from them because you will not receive a working item and will getting your money back will be pain",
          "I bought this headset over the summer and at first it worked great. decent sound quality, the microphone was fine, the battery lasted a while, everything was great. after a few months it started degrading very quickly. First I would start hearing clicks randomly, now it's completely disconnecting itself for a few seconds and reconnecting, even when the battery is fully charged, or while it is plugged in charging. Additionally, the microphone used to be able to bend and move out of the way when I wasn't using it, But it seems to have lost it's ability to stay put, and always just falls right back into position",
          "They are a comfortable pair of headphones.  I didn't mind wearing them for longer periods of time (over an hour).  For the price point, I'd say they're good comfort and quality.My grievances are all centered around the audio quality.  These are bass-heavy.  If you like that sort of thing, they are likely a great option.  I prefer a flatter, more audiophile response, so these aren't to my tastes.  I also found the mid-range (voice band) to be muddy.  It could just be my ears, and my lack of ear-time with bass-heavy headphones, but I had a difficult time understanding others on conference calls.  The mic quality seemed fine, but intelligibility was poor.One last grievance: these headphones have almost no side tone.  That is, you can't hear yourself talking.  When in a conference call, I couldn't tell how loud I was speaking.  That's a kudos to the noise isolation that the ear pads provide, but a big red flag for the engineers doing the audio balancing.Bottom line: if you're listening primarily for music enjoyment and gaming, these are probably fine.  If you do a lot of virtual meetings and conferencing, however, I'd pass.",
          "I've gone through a few different over ear headsets before finding these. I've owned my own pair for years now and have zero complaints.They hold their charge quite well to the point that even today after more than 2 years, I'll forget that they eventually need to be plugged in (I can get at least a week of all-day use for work on top of gaming for a few hours a week before they'll make their \"low battery\" beeps). Even better is that they charge via USB, so there's always a cord that can be used within my reach.The sound is great. They're probably not the best to an audiophile in terms of quality, but to the average person these are going to sound pretty damn good. The mic quality is quite good for a wireless headset as well - none if the \"radio\" distortion that other similar headsets seem to struggle with.Lastly, the comfort. These are absurdly comfortable. I wear these ALL day and have zero discomfort. No irritation on the top of my head from the strap, no tenderness on my ears from the padding, just and extremely comfortable fit.I've bought these for friends and recommend them to coworkers. If you just need a quality pair of headphones that sound great, fit well, and don't cost as much as a console, these are for you. I'll never get a different pair again.",
          "This headset is really good. I\u2019ve owned 2 other wireless headsets that being the Turtle beach stealth 600 and the HyperX cloud flight which was my most recent one. This headset gets much louder than the Turtle beach and overall has much better sound. Way better battery life too. With my hyperX I always had this problem where the audio would cut out for a second then come back on. Some days it didn\u2019t do it but when it did it was super annoying. The cloud flight also didn\u2019t have the bass these do. The gunshots in games sounded almost tinny compared to the Cooler master. Not to mention the software which is WAY better on the cooler master headset. You can customize the sound to however you like and not to mention the 7.1 surround sound. You also don\u2019t need to worry about comfort because I can wear these for hours and still feel great.",
          "If you're looking to buy this headset for gaming, look the other way. Maybe my headphones were defective, but the audio quality was so muffled I couldn't hear anything. The bass just overpowered everything and I could not tell player positioning in game due to the audio quality. I played with the EQ settings on windows, I downloaded the latest drivers, I used the CoolerMaster Software that comes with the product, I also adjusted in-game audio settings for COD... Nothing seemed to give me clear and crisp audio quality. My HyperX Cloud headsets are better, I wanted these as a wireless option. I'm currently in the process of returning this product and I plan to look elsewhere for a new pair of wireless gaming headphones.",
          "The headset literally broke when I picked it up other than that pretty good but take good care of it.",
          "Bought this product for my boyfriend and he loves it! Great sound quality and for gaming.",
          "I use this product on the daily. It has long lasting battery life and great noise cancellation. They are very comfortable.",
          "Awesome quality sound, great 20hr battery life, super comfy, the mic is really good but its a lil muffled. Not sure if its just me.",
          "I love everything about this product, they cover really well my ears and the sound quality is great. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes when i'm listening to multiple things at the same time the audio kind of goes into slow motion for a few seconds, then it gets back to normal.",
          "The CoolerMaster MH670 is ALMOST the nicest headset I've ever owned.Quick summary:They have really nice sound.  They look great, and they are really comfortable...at first.Details:As I mentioned, the audio in these will not disappoint unless you're one of those audiophile guys.  If that's you, probably don't buy wireless headphones.  :)  The mic is decent, though I would like some additional noise-cancelling options from Cooler Master (CM) in their software.  Any way to gate/compress/limit certain bands to decrease background noise would be nice.In terms of fit, I have a really large head and these fit really well.  No pinching.  No discomfort from the headband.  No problems with the fit at all.My only serious complaint about these is that the earpads are fake leather-like material.  I've owned headsets with this in the past, and knew that they would get hot on my ears, but these take it to a whole new level.  Within 30 minutes, I have sweat dripping down my neck.  My first thought to remedy this was to buy a replacement set from CM, but they don't sell them.  I know that they make these pads in a breathable material because they have them on the MH630 and MH650, but they don't sell them in their online store and when I contacted their support folks, they said they are not available for purchase despite the fact that there are likely pallets of them sitting in their warehouse.Because I couldn't get breathable pads from CM, I decided to go look at after-market earpads, but this is where everything derailed.  The industry standard (if there is really a standard) size for oval earpads is 90mm x 110mm.  For some reason, CM decided to scale their earpads down to 85mm x 105mm, which means that none of the after-market pads fit this headset.  I have no idea why they did this unless it has something to do w/ saving money or making them slightly lighter??I will most likely be returning these headphones pretty soon because the heat levels really do make it an overall unpleasant experience.  I wish CM would just offer the replacement pads as they do for other headsets on their website, but here we are.",
          "They're good. Dare I say really good as far as sound goes. But, as I am sure many can attest, sound quality isn't the only factor in buying a headset. I'll just write my cons in a list in ascending order of how annoying it is to me.- Headset LED flashes red and green constantly. Others have reported the same issue with this pair. Manual says it's either supposed to be red or green, not flickering between both non-stop. Can't be good for battery life, either.- Charging cable is Micro USB and 3 feet long.  HyperX was the first company to commit this 3 foot cable sin on my old Cloud Stinger Wireless, and now CM has gone and done it as well. Companies, stop. Just stop. I really hope this isn't the norm because I hate it.- These things are heavy. At least to me, my old headset, named in the con above, genuinely felt like it was half the weight of these. Granted, this CM pair gets much better battery life, but still. Causes occasional discomforting pressure on my head after a while.- They creak, a lot. Every time I move my head, it creaks. If I wanna move my ears, it creaks. A lot. Loudly. In multiple places. Constantly. I genuinely can't stand it.- CM's software sucks. Didn't install properly for me on the first try, it's unintuitive, doesn't show battery life, EQ settings are a joke, and the presets are even worse. Uninstalled it after 2 days once I realized it was resetting my windows EQ settings EVERY time I restarted my computer.That's my list of \"sins\"  I guess, so conclusion time. Maybe the more positive reviews are from people who don't mind or notice these issues, or maybe my pair is bad, but the software is just inexcusable from a company as big as CM. On paper these seem perfect- they look good, battery lasts forever, sound good (if you avoid their software EQ), and have big, thick, comfortable earpads. But mine have a lot of constant and really annoying issues, and that's why I am probably sending these back for some Nari's or HS70's. I heard so many great things about the MH751 and MH752, and since their MH600 series is newer (weird naming choice BTW, CM), I figured they had built upon their success to make an even better product, finally with a wireless variant. But, I was wrong. The end.",
          "I bought the wireless version of this with the intent of replacing the stock headphones of my Oculus Rift. While these ARE more comfortable and sound ok, that's where the appeal ends. For wireless, they really aren't useable.First of all, this may be minor, but the USB-C adapter does nothing. I plugged the USB transmitter thing into the UBC adapter, then plugged that into my computer and it didn't pick up or activate. It DOES work if you just plug the USB transmitter directly into a USB port, which is fine, but it kinda defeats the purpose of including the USB-C thing if it doesn't do anything when plugged in.But here is what makes it completely worthless for its purpose: The battery. Before the first time I used it, I used the included USB cable to charge it until it was fully charged and the light turned green. Battery seemed to last fine the first day. Since then, I've always put it back on the charger after use. Today, I picked it up and played some more, and within 10 minutes it started doing this thing where the sound dips out and it makes a beep. I'm assuming that's the low battery warning, because after another 20 minutes of that, the headset just died. Bizarre, considering it had been charging for days and the light was green. Well, I plugged it back into the charger, waited a few hours, and after the light turned green I unplugged it and tried using it wireless again...and once again, within 10 minutes the battery started to go, and in 20 it was dead. In the week I've had it, I've probably had this headset on for a total of 8 hours, and charged it between sessions of use, which have never been more than two hours straight. Something tells me it was never actually charging...",
          "This is totally worth my money it shipped super fast and works great i would definitely recommend these the only thing is the size so they are a little big but overall GREAT",
          "I don't think you'll find similar quality at this price point among any of the other competitors. Way better than the logitech, steel series and roccat I've had before. Although those 3 different headsets have been over the last decade.",
          "Let me just start off with the fact that these do *work* like advertised**but** they will randomly static out and cut audio connection. This will reset the rgb in your pc, crash games, kick you off zoom, and kill audio from discord streams.The software is awful and the eq is atrociousAlso there is an led on the usb antenna and headphone that constantly blinks, so use in the dark kind of sucks.But fr these are cheap and I'm currently using them, because I'm broke and can't get new ones and cooler masters customer service is trash",
          "This suits my need perfectly.  Sound is good for the price range.  Mic is good enough, no complaints from online games like Warzone and such. The mic is also adjustable with the boom mic.  The style and build quality was a surprise to me.  Works well in wireless or wired 3.5mm on PC and PS4.  Android with 3.5mm was good too.  Fitment-wise I had to adjust to it coming from Logitech, but was comfortable enough.  I would had never thought Cooler Master making a good headset. Solid buy for me.",
          "My product was fine for less than $30. It failed the durability test for me when the plastic that is screwed together disintegrated where the head fitting and the right side speaker meet. Now it's just hanging by the electrical wire. Bought this in December of 2020. It just now broke in May 2022. Ehh it's so so for the price. Going to buy some new higher end gaming headset to avoid the use of cheap plastic parts.",
          "The most comfortable headset in the world but sounds bad. At first after my hyperx i always thought that ears are not equal and left dynamic works louder. Than i got used to it. But still it sounds way not so good. It sometimes when i charge it and play at the same time gives me weak electrical shocks like touching cat that have been running 2 hours on a carpet.But after all, i still like it. They are very comfortable. I can play a lot in them. Microphone is nice even despite it is wireless. I can easily go to kitchen and there never be signal drop. They sound strange after my hyperx in music or watching cinema but in gaming i don't feel any problems.Still i would even recommend it. Top built quality. Top microphone. Normal sound. Never problems with connectivity. Very comfortable.",
          "Really clean sound. Get plenty loud and the battery life is decent",
          "Less than a year had passed before I had to go through CoolerMasters RMA process. The plastic where the hinge is connected to the headband was cracking on both sides and eventually fell apart. Its a great headset, its not the most comfortable but its not awful in that regard. It doesn't have the best range either, I've gotten better out of AirPods. Its got 3.5mm input and a detachable microphone at least which is more than I can say for most headsets I've looked at especially in this price range, and the audio quality is pretty decent. Durability will probably be the biggest issue, as well as the charging connector being Micro-USB. Overall, it ends up being pretty good at everything though, just not the best.",
          "good build, nice cups, headband does cause a bit of pain in long uses. and sees better audio and voice when plugged in. The cords you get are really nice but they decided to put this silly locking port on the ear cup, so if you break it you will have to get in touch with support. and at the moment they are moving stuff on the site around, so far the only ticket reply i got was \"send a email here\". its nearly been two weeks now. If you get dont break anything",
          "Not gonna lie had this headset for about a week now and so far I love it. Also it doesn\u2019t cancel out a 100% of noise which is perfect to me because I don\u2019t wanna not here nothing around me. But it cancels out most of noise if you one of those people who like that.",
          "I'm gonna keep this simpleComfort: 5/5. HUGE pads, enough clamp to keep them on your head but not too much that it hurts, nicely padded headband. Wore these for 9 hours, my only issue is that my ears were only the tiniest bit sweaty when taking them off. Not even a little bit of fatigue, and that's rare for me because I have massive ears.Build Quality: 3.5/5. This is a cheap wireless gaming headset, it's entirely made of plastic. It's good quality plastic, but still. I don't think these will break anytime soon.Sound Quality: 4.5/5? This is kinda hard to rate, but I feel like I have to take into the equation 2 things. 1, this is a wireless gaming headset. 2, it only costs $119.99, $109.99 when on sale. The sound of this headset in it's default stereo 2.0 mode, Is actually pretty damn good. Bass is decently extended, Midbass can be a little bloated sounding but it's honestly more welcome than hindering. Mids, albeit a little recessed are detailed well enough and the tone is pretty much spot on. The high-mids to treble range seems a bit dark to me, but I don't really detect any amount of detail loss. Soundstage and Imaging are fine on this headset, the soundstage is relatively wide but the imaging and and spacing of instruments in music is just average. For gaming, these will be perfectly adequate for footstep articulation and spacial awareness. These are just a very soft and easy to listen to headset, which was surprising to me. Usually gaming headsets sound very very unnatural with Overdone Bass that sounds sloppy and peaky treble that's boosted to the point that It just can't be used for anything other than gaming. Sounds pretty great right? but then you enable the 7.1 Surround Sound button on the right earcup. DO NOT do that. The high-mid to treble section gets boosted like atleast 10db, and not in a way that just makes it \"bright.\" These become treble cannons and very sibilant. In gaming use this could be desirable but even after gaming for an hour in this mode, my ears were ringing and it wasn't pleasant. On top of the decrease in sound quality, it also added 0 perceived spacial awareness, which seems pretty beside the point. So yeah, as a normal stereo headphone with no EQ? Pretty damn solid for what you pay for. Don't expect miracles tho.5/5 for casual gaming3/5 for competitive gaming4/5 for musicMic Quality: 4/5. This is the same incredible mic that you get on the MH751/2. It's the best mic on a gaming headset. But in Wireless mode, it seems like the bandwidth for the mic is very little, and it causes it to sound very muffled and distant. In comparison to my ModMic Wireless, it's night and day. The ModMic sounds 10x better.But when you use this headset wired, the mic transforms into this almost professional condenser mic quality, it's kind of insane. 5/5 in wired, 3/5 in wireless. No static or distortion, your voice will be heard easily, but it just sounds very muffled.Wireless Range: 4/5. Was able to walk around my entire (tiny) apartment and receive the full signal. Haven't gone further, but i feel like it would cut out the moment I go outside.Battery life: 5/5. The specifications from Cooler Master state 18 hours. The headset hasn't died yet on me once, and I've used it for 16-ish hours in one sitting with no charge before, so the 18 hours is probably accurate. Don't see how anyone could need a longer lasting battery. I feel like I've covered every point I need to.TLDR: These sound good, the mic is fine, and the comfort is the best out of any headphone I've owned. If you need a cheaper wireless headset and don't care about Surround Sound, this one's for you.By the way, to all of you complaining that the light keeps flashing red and green, it's because you have the mic mute button enabled. Please just press the button again and stop acting like Cooler Master rolled out a defective product.",
          "I bought these in Nov of 2020, so they almost made it a year, they don't get used often, maybe a max of 10 hours a week, picked them up today and they just crumbled apart. Can not find a way to email cooler master for a manufacture warranty as well, there is no contact information I can locate.",
          "If you happen to catch them on sale, they are an excellent option!, I was afraid due to the mixed reviews, but finally in my hands, they feel good quality, and the sound is actually good, It's not the greatest, but with a tweak in the EQ the sound hits a sweet spot, I would  recommend them if you see them on sale.",
          "Update: My first headset months after my original purchase the microphone stopped working the company is impossible to reach the manufacturer Amazon sent a replacement and was grateful however, the second headset had the same hardware failure. Same issues trying to reach the manufacturer now Without the mic, it\u2019s a over 100 dollar pair of wireless headphones, headset is top heavy and wants to slide off your ears if you bend you head and look down they end up in your handsPrevious Review:Inside and outside of gaming this wireless and in wired more is the complete package, solid sound quality, good mic, good hardware structure what else could you ask for? The audio quality is probably one of the best I've heard outside of other wireless headsets friends and family have themselves, do yourself a favor and download MasterPlus software from Cooler Master.Con : I have to adjust it occasionally it likes to slide off my head on occasion but that's just a minor issue.",

        "reviews": [
          "Honestly, these were a dream pair for myself, but the only issue that I ever had with these is that there is a little bit of a sound loop where the sound coming from the headphones can be picked up by the attached microphone. (I'm not sure whether or not this is just something that I've dealt with but it does get annoying sometimes.)  Other than that they are the most amazing pair of headphones I have ever owned.",
          "I bought this for the microphone but ended up returning them.Here's why:Microphone issues:- Crosstalk (Basically if your headphones are too loud (over 75%) the microphone will pickup what your listening too (Omni-directional disadvantages, or design failure?) and when you use your mic in games / others will hear it (including your video recording software!) which is bad news for content creators)- Microphone Echo (Something nobody else has pointed out is that when you speak there's a noticeable double layer echo in your voice) After trying absolutely everything to fix this issue / I found a side step solution. You will have to buy a KINGTOP 3.5mm Combo Audio Adapter Cable (with a 3.5 extension cable) and be creative enough to attach and detach your mic to your headset (maybe a sticky magnet? / tape) and then deal with a second wire if you want to use the mic to its fullest potential.Comfort / No Third-Party Cushion options- Despite the Mh 630s being lightweight. I find the cushions on the earpads to warm my ears to uncomfortable levels (Might be great during the winter though) and you'll probably experience the same.- There's almost no Third-Party Earpad replacements for MH 630s and you have to go to cooler masters official website to buy direct replacements. Have you ever tried Wicked Cushions? Too bad - you won't be able to experience them here.Sound Quality:In comparison to the HyperX Cloud II's - I find myself dissatisfied with the lack of bass (there really is none at all!) and your going to want to buy a DAC to fix this.Conclusion: Not worth the $60 price pointIf you can get a pair of HyperX Cloud II's (or alpha's) for the similar price; they absolutely destroy MH630 in comfort and sound quality. Sadly even the mic because of the mentioned issues.",
          "Originally it was alright I thought the boom mic was gonna be good but the quality wasn't that great a lot of people always say it sounds like under water or that the sound is muffled but I didn't mind at first though the headset is comfortable and has good sound. Later the mic started cutting out while I was playing games which made it hard to communicate and then finally at the end it started playing back all the sounds it was receiving so if I was playing something and listing to music my party or group would hear echoes of coms or other background sounds like my Spotify music or other videos. Maybe my set was busted but idk it wasn't that great ide just buy a better mic then deal with this kinda stuff. Planning to replace it with an Artcis 7 hopefully it works out better.",
          "Bought it for my kids, and the mic and headset work well. youtuber Hardware Canucks did a gaming headset reveiw which showed this sounding better than more expensive headsets. Be sure to consider cable length, don't get a short 4ft cable with other brands.-Cons:  Cable 3.5mm tip broke (our fault) and they do not sell a replacement, communication with Cooler Master isn't so great if you don't know your serial number- make sure to register your product or your going to have a difficult time communicating.",
          "The headset is comfortable and brings a nice storage bag. Plugs directly into my controller. It does have a slight SMALL echo in party chats when playing multiplayer (but nothing bad). IMPORTANT: In order to change the volume settings you must start a Party>Options> Audio Options. You can mess with the control volume there. Yes, you have to be in your own party alone if you are playing a single player games.",
          "The mic on this headset is phenomenal but since it\u2019s Omni directional it\u2019ll catch your surroundings so not ideal for noisy environments. Also the sound bleeds very bad through the headset when cranked all the way. To the point where people in the party can hear it as well through the mic",
          "They are really bad, this headphones are not made for talking with people in parties because they can hear everything you hear and the echo is horrible, the echo is the worst there is no way you can talk with people",
          "I love how light these headphones are! The ear muffs are incredibly comfortable to put on as well and I am able to wear them for long periods of time without discomfort. The sound quality is pretty good too, but it doesn't do well at cancelling out background noise that happens around you.The feature that I dislike the most about these headphones is that the microphone is so long and not retractable. Whenever I use the mic, I keep catching it in the corner of my eye and it gets pretty distracting.",
          "Nice headset but one con is the bass. There is an easy fix on PC and that is to just enhance the bass in audio settings.",
          "These were much better than anticipated, especially with getting them with Black Friday pricing. Fits comfortably, good sound, really good mic, and a super flexible cable. Unless you have a need for 7.1 Dolby, go for the MH630's over the MH650's. Definitely happy with these.",
          "It's awesome, quality, sound reduction, everything. I personally am not into headsets too much but these are definitely worth it.",
          "My son loves this.  He said one of the best headsets for gaming he has owned. And we have been through many.",
          "Most comfortable headset I have ever used. great for wearing for long periods of time. Mic quality is good, my friends say its clear and easy to hear me. Fantastic that you can take the mic part of, great if you have an external mic. All in all great headset.",
          "Yes these headphones fit good, and does not feel like they're burning my ears after a while, and I have a big head compared to most people. The sound quality is no beat by Dre, but they're pretty good and the mic on this works fine. These are perfect headphones if you just want something cheap and realiable.",
          "Audio and mic quality are great, but then they broke out of the blue,  with the right side being the worst. I handed them normally, no rage throws or hard slams.",
          "great sound, good mic, light Wight, feels HQ plastic insipid the price but the cable is a bit short for my rig so i have to use a usb DAC with a long usb cable.and as The Techne said  STINKIN COZY ;)",
          "I was expecting a decent cheap headset but these are much worse than reviews state. On my PS4 the mic has so much cross talk and echo that I can barley play with my friends without them complaining that my mic sounds terrible. Also when on mute my mic somehow manages to still be on to a degree and still cause echo. On my laptop in discord things would seem to be a bit better with little to no cross talk and no echo however my mic constantly cuts our for no reason, not sure if thats a discord problem or the headset problem. Other than the major flaws of the mic on multiple platforms, the sound quality is at most decent, nothing to truly brag about and the most note worthy thing would have to be the amazing comfort. Overall just quite disappointed l expected something decent but for its price point I\u2019m not even surprised and in all honesty if u can stick some headphones in the $100-$200 price range or just go for another brand all together around this price because these are shitty.",
          "Overall, this headset is very solid and comfortable imo. There are a couple of nit-picky things that I don't like but the sound and comfort, as well as the mic are supreme.PROS:-Probably the best headset mic out there-The earpads are soft and cushion, mesh outside and leather inside-Good value for its price (60$), although I picked it up for 40$ on black Friday-Isnt super bulky and clunky, fits comfortably on the head-Your ears don't touch the drivers which was my main issue with my old hyperx-Cables are detachableCONS:-Big flaw being game sound can be heard through the mic.  When on discord people can hear my game echo through the mic-The mute switch isn't the best spot. It's hard to access and a remote controller like the ones hyperx use would be preferable-The cable is very short. It's about 5 feet at the most and when plugged in the back of your pc, it is even shorter.-There is fizzing noise when you mute your mic. Discord picks it up quite often.-The hinges don't seem super durable, will update if anything happens.My biggest concern with this headset so far is the microphone fizzing and sound pickup from the headphones. Its annoying especially if you're recording and you can hear the faint echo in the back. The cable could have been longer, but it isn't the worst thing. I just wished they added a remote mute or flip up instead of the button which is kind of hard to access. Also, if the ring was black instead of purple, just would've been better. Overall, I still give it a 8/10 and if it goes back to 40$, I would definitely pick this up over the corsair hs60, arctis 3s, and the hyperx cloud stingers.",
          "Not good enough as described",
          "Excellent microphone!!! Great for gaming. Not so great for music.",
          "This headset is lovely, aside from a VERY bad issue with the mic picking up the audio no matter what you set the audio level to. This makes the bleed into the mic annoying for any real use.The mic quality is amazing. Use it with a proper sound card and it is up there with stand-alone mics. However, whatever they did to the mic attachment part, causes sound bleed.I've tried different sound cards, lowered the headset volume to nothing, made sure to turn off their in-line mic crap that is turned on (causing an echo) and even attempted to contact them. Their support is really quite crappy, even if they have some good products like the Evo 212 cpu heatsink.If you're thinking of buying the Cooler Master MH630, don't. If you want it just for the audio, there are better alternatives, albeit maybe a bit more costly. If you wanted the clarity from the mic, you might as well go for Razor Seiren Mini, which'll be just as good, without having any audio bleed.If they would actually be helpful for support and either tell me how to actually stop the bleed that only appears when the mic portion is plugged in, or offer to replace it, this mic would be amazing.Outside of the audio bleeding into the mic, the audio is actually kinda nice. It isn't stellar, but you can't expect that from a cheap priced headset. The mic quality, when it isn't picking up and echoing from the headphone part, is amazingly clear. As if you're right there with the person, even if it is a bit quiet. If the weird audio bleed didn't exist, then this would definitely be a 5 star for the price and performance.Their support though gets a crappy 1 star regardless. I went through their website and the person wrote one reply in a single week, and it was just \"have you tried it on your laptop?\" and nothing since.",
          "Bought for gaming on pc, and didn\u2019t want to buy headphones and an expensive microphone, and this saved me. Mic is amazing on recording and quality is great. Can\u2019t complain at all.",
          "I like the overall quality of this product. Really nothing to dislike. I used this for gaming and watching",
          "The audio is great, mic is great, and it muffles outside noise decently. They're pretty good for this price range, however they did cut some corners with the build quality. Everything is solid except a crucial point, the swiveling ear pieces.I have owned this headset for less than a year and the left ear has broken in torsion. I did not use them inappropriately and I did not play with the swiveling ears at all (or put them in any risk with too much torque around the ear pieces). When it broken, upon further inspection the peg that connects the ear to the rest of the headset failed in torsion. Be very careful with handling the headset, especially with the ears.",
          "I got this on sale on Black friday and could not be happier than my purchase. This headset replaced my Razer Kraken X's and they blow them off the charts. This headset has 1. Better sound quality 2. Better Microphone 3. A better build. I would completely recommend this headset for gamers on a budget.",
          "The headphones were fantastic the first month! But then all the sudden the mic was playing everything I was hearing. So I would be in a discord call with friends and when they said something they could hear what they said through my microphone. Once I plugged in my $15 headphones that I had for years they worked just fine. I played with settings and searched up results and found nothing. I even tried changing the mic out and it kept doing it. But they had great sound quality and were comfortable. The noise canceling was pretty good. But they were not the headphones for me because I bought them hoping for a good quality mic while getting good quality head phones for gaming at a cheap price.",
          "Nice sounding but cheaply made. This is my second pair of this headset. 1st pair the plastic piece just above the ear piece swivel point cracked and came off. It basically made the pair unusable. Didn't even have them a year before the break.Since I like them I bought another pair and again less than a year after I bought them the same thing happened again. A piece broke off ( I saved it) and the rest cracked. I super glued it together but it is not holding. Right now it is taped up until a new pair of SteelSeries Arctis 5 gaming headset arrives.",
          "The headphones sound good, the microphone is decent (although after a while of use the microphone starts to have a lot of background noise), they are comfortable even with glasses and they are quite nice.But that is useless if they are going to break after 3 months of use, since you touch these headphones for the first time you realize that they are made of a plastic that is quite cheap and although I am very careful with things and had never dropped them suddenly when I was taking them off they broke, now I have to use headphones glued with glue that at any time will break again.I was about to give this product 5 stars but unfortunately and even though I like the brand I can't give it more than 3 stars because in an item that you are going to use so much you need it to last and even if you bought them because you think they are good value for money they are not such a good buy.",
          "Lasted about six months, then both earcups decided to completely detatch from the headband at their pivot points. Very disappointed as I'm never rough with any of my headsets and this one couldn't even handle light use. Plus the echo was horrendous until I swapped out the ear foams with leather ones.",
          "Good for everything except for making YT videos, If you're listening to music and upload a video the music can be heard in the background",
          "This product has really amazing build quality, comfort, and microphone quality. It\u2019s crazy that I was able to get all of the above for $50.  Real sleeper pick for anyone who wants a solid gaming headset. Way better value than other big gaming brands.",
          "really happy with this set, best fit, and performance i have had yet. can wear them pretty much all day and they stay very comfortable, sound is excellent, mic is perfect",
          "This Over-Ear headset is great and can rotate 90 degree inwards and very plush cushions. The sound is good and nice touches like volume wheel on the back is a bit in for no accidental volume change as well as a detachable sleeved 3.5 cable and mic. Mic also sounds great. Only negative with the headset is that sometimes can't tell when the mic mute button is on or off.",
          "I'm going to update later but the microphone for this headset does not work I'm going to update this, later on, to see if this microphone works or not.",
          "My discord group says there is a static sound coming from my audio when I use these, so I'm not entirely sure about the sound quality. Not entirely soundproof, can still hear people (but then again, I put volume pretty low, maybe if you turned the volume up it'd be better) I use these for both my work video calls and watching Youtube, Twitch, gaming, and streaming Netflix. It makes me feel like an airplane pilot with how these look on me, haha.",
          "Overall a very solid headset, a little difficult to set up and not as comfortable as most people will lead you to believe but for $60, or in the case of a sale, $50, you really can't go wrong with this headset.",
          "Pros+ Great sound+ Great mic+ Comfy earpads+ Detachable cables+ Good design and style, purple & matte black combination looks great+ Fabric bagCons- Mic picks up desktop audio sometimes- Headband piece is too heavy and stiff, could use better cushions or change the material of the band (which i believe it's steel & plastic)- The cable has a woven texture that can get easily bent and damaged with useOne thing to keep in mind:Beware of not hearing from the outside if you use them in high volume, so if you do not want to get in trouble keep them at a medium volume or prepare to get scolded from not listeningI bought them as an upgrade to my laptop's microphone and they worked great on calls and video calls.It's been a while since I had the need to use them for this purpose so I gave these to my brother so that he could try out the sound quality with battlefield v and he loves them.I know he will put them to good use and he is happy so I am happy too !",
          "These headphones are really great! The mic is way better than I thought it would be, and it's really clean! Sound comes perfect and has a nice noise cancellation to it. Thought the purple ring would light up, but still, they're really good. Fast shipping and arrived in 2 weeks to Portugal. 9/10",
          "I really like this headset. I usually don't like headsets or over-the-ear headphones. Because I don't like pressure on my head, and I don't like the heat that they cause on my ears. But the soft material these are made with are great. They put zero pressure on my head, weigh very little, and don't trap heat in with your ears.The microphone is the best quality available for a gaming headset. I use it to record videos, and it's better than the desk mic I was using before. I had a much more expensive wireless headset, and it's quality was too bad to even use (plus it had fake-leather ear cups that trapped your heat in).I also love that the wires come out of the headset, and that the headset comes with a velvet bag for easy storage. Keeps it clean and dust-free between uses.Cons are that 1. you can hear the cable rubbing on your clothes through the plastic ear cup. It's not an issue while there's action, but when there's silence, it's really loud and annoying. You can tell that the ear cups are cheap plastic.  2. There's also very little noise isolation, since they don't squeeze your head and the soft material of the cups are so soft. But that part doesn't bother me. If noise isolation from your environment is what you're looking for, the 630 probably isn't a good choice. Maybe the next level up with the faux leather would work better for this, but I'm not aware.",
          "The only downside is feedback issues with the microphone, everything else is top notch",
          "I use this primarily on XBOX via the chat adapter. Just ordered a second pair ofMH-630's when the price dropped as a gift or just for back up.  Great headphones for gaming and music. Never will I ever buy expensive gaming headphones again.",
          "I have owned alot of gaming headsets over the years and Wow has the Industry come a very long way!My sons use the Razer Black Shark V2 X and V2 which are absolutely excellent for the Money. My Wife and I currently own The Sennheiser Gamer Zero headsets which are amazing.I had heard many good things about Cooler Master Brand online (As a Fellow Youtuber and content creator) a Good Headset for my Live Streams is also very important. Naturally I was open to giving them a go for a good traveling / gaming headset or a back up if one of my other ones fail for some reason. Sadly these did not work OTB \"out of the box\" and I understand sometimes you can get a lemon from any production company selling any product. I will be sticking with my (2) go to brand moving forward as cooler master did not make a good first impression with its products.Chris ( DropForgedSurvival )",
          "The microphone on this didn\u2019t work (for me) but the sound quality is alright.",
          "TL;DR review: MH630 is best comfortable, comes with nice microphone, and very cost efficient. You sacrifice sound quality a bit but bottom line is still acceptable for music listening while great for gaming.What I like it most is the comfort level. It's light, the cloth ear cup is exceptionally easy on head, and breath well. Clamping force is well managed that it is tight enough but not making a strong pushing down. I can literally wear it all day without any discomfort. It's by far the most comfortable headset, even compared with MH751 and other highly recommended models.Microphone is great. It's very similar to MH751 and close to V-MODA BoomPro. You will be able to tell the difference, but I don't think it is easy to say which is better - they are just slightly different and captures voice with a different profile. All of them captures clear and fully bodied voice and some surrounding sound.Sound quality - just ok. Yes this is where you sacrifice on for the price. It is still better than many at $80 price tag. It lacks in mid-range which causes most music sound much flatter and with little body. There's no obvious distortion, which is great, because that means with EQ tune it will sound better. Overall, it is a good pair of driver tuned for gaming. It still does music and other tasks well, just not as good as something like MH751.Will definitely recommend this to friends and family.",
          "---Update 7/27/2021---Cooler Master received my broken headset on 5/25/2021 and it is now 7/27/2021.  More than two months have passed since they received my broken headset and I still have not received my replacement.  Yet Amazon shows stock and is selling them new.  This is ridiculous.---Original review below---I really wanted to like these.  I watched all the videos on them and they seemed to check all the boxes.  Good sounding mic, removable/replaceable cord, no in-line mute/volume button, inexpensive...  Exactly what I was looking for.  However, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.First, they weren't as comfortable as I hoped.  I have a big head and need to extend the band all the way.  It fit but felt like it would feel much better if it extended a quarter inch more on each side.  The ear cups were big enough but just barely.  I would say the comfort level for me was barely adequate.  Additionally, the headset jack wouldn't plug into my phone without taking off the case.  Super annoying...  I have other headphones whos cable plugs into my phone without having to take off the case.The sound was OK but nothing like my high-fi headphones.  Also, the audio bled into the mic.  During games people could clearly hear what I was listening to.  I would describe the overall experience with this  headset as \"meh\".Then they broke...  I'm not a design engineer but it's easy to see how these broke.  The junction between the earphones and head band is poorly designed.  Just looking at it you can tell it will never last.  When Cooler Master received the broken headset, they sent me a message that said, \"the warehouse will be pulling the replacement product and preparing it for shipping.\".  That was 16 days ago.  I haven't heard anything from them since.  When I get them back, they are immediately going up for sale.  It's too bad...  I hate leaving a negative review and I would have loved to love this product.  Sometimes the truth hurts...",
          "These are amazing clear mic and seem and feel durable im enjoying them.",
          "The headphones are good as I expected but there are two problems.. the headphones bleed when I play music at an average or higher level and the microphone has static even when I mute it or am not talking. Otherwise the headphones were good, hopefully this was just misfortune and I got the short end of the stick.",
          "These just came in today and I was excited to test them out, these were brand new headphones that just came in 2 hours ago. I tested them out on my laptop and come to surprise, the right speaker is the only one that works... I checked the settings on my laptop, everything was fine. Then I went to YouTube to see if I could fix this problem and all the audio would come out the right speaker no matter what I tried... I'd compare this purchase to me literally setting $60 on fire and I waited a little less than a week just for some broken headphones.",
          "Great quality headphones. Use them for everything. From gaming, to zoom calls, to taking the train. These headphones are very comfortable and light. Gave my wireless beats solo alway and stayed with these wired Cooler Masters.",
          "I bought these in September 2020.  I treat all of my belongings with care.  These had a dedicated head-band supported wall hanger with cord relief that I used to store them after each use.  In June 2021, they literally fell apart in my hands as I was removing them to hang back up.  The plastic post used to swivel the left ear piece snapped in half for no apparent reason.  Attempting to leverage the 2 year warranty seems unobtainable.  Cooler Master requires a serial number they claim is on the headset, which it is not.  I no longer have the box to check for a serial number tag there either.  Their contact options don't allow you to deal with a real human to explain your situation.  Utter garbage...  The sound quality and mic quality were fine though."

          "Buy this if you enjoy having a low quality or defective product. Cool Master should stick to only selling fans because this headset doesn't even function properly. Sound emits from the left ear noticeably louder than from the right ear. Sometimes the issue would fix itself with a simple re-plug if you were lucky. Would not recommend.",
          "absolutely love them for gaming, great for shooter games as well to hear your opponents!! AMAZING with music!",
          "Great sound and mic. Does what it\u2019s supposed to do. The price may be a little too high, but no other complaints.",
          "this mic is kinda low if you have it for around 2 months",
          "When I purchased the MH650, I was sent the MH630 instead and it was replaced after contacting support.  Got the replacement and everything was fine for a while, mic was okay, sound was good, lights worked for the most part sometimes they wouldn't and you can download the application for controls. After a while, the part around the band snapped. Got in touch with Cooler Master on their site, and their responses were slow and they didn't respond after my last message. Probably not buying another product from Cooler Master.",
          "After a couple of months they broke at the base of one ear piece. Since it was too long for a refund I simply decided to glue it, and after a couple of months the other side broke from another part where the screws were fixed to the ear piece. They are useless now, I've never had a headset so fragile and simply bad design.",
          "The comfort on this headset really stands out! I have a big head and my ears kind of stick out a bit so they always scratch up against the drivers in the headphones. These don\u2019t do that at all and the clamping force and adjustability is perfect! The sound is great. definitely the best out of any headset I\u2019ve had so far. I highly recommend and I generally am not that impressed with most headsets. I\u2019d say these are better than the hyper cloud 2s and the Logitech G pro which are about the same price.",
          "I'm not sure why everyone is saying the sound quality is amazing. Maybe at the price point, but the sound is certainly not great. The bass in these headphones is not great and I've tried adjusting the sound settings in every which way. They only go up to 2k frequency and most manufacturers aim for up to 20k.",
          "I got this headset because I was looking for a overall good looking headset with good sound and a great mic. I found just that. This headset is the best headset i've ever owned in terms of microphones on a headset. The audio of the headset is good but I have head more audiofile headphones that obviously sound way better. But this headset is perfect for gaming and watching videos or movies. The mic on it is really great. I suggest watching a few videos on it with mic tests to determine if you like the way the mic sounds but for me this is just the perfect headset... besides the cable length. It feels a tad short. but overall great. This headset also is a USB headset. Does not have an external soundcard so you have to deal with your pc's default audio drivers. but mine seem great so that works for me. Anyways yeah, overall. Fantastic Headset!",
          "I bought this headset in Jan 2021. It lasted me not even 2 years before falling apart. It really did just fall apart while on my head. I never threw or slammed my headset and yet the pieces that hold the ear pads to the the top both broke and it\u2019s not fixable. One side broke in April 2022 and now the the other side both times while they were simply just on my head. Mic and sound quality was good but what\u2019s the point when you can\u2019t even wear It. One of the Earpads would also come off every so often and was a pain to put back on. Would not recommend in the slightest",
          "\u201cThese are way cool Mom\u201d exact words from my teen son.  Loved the lights too...",
          "This is a great product at a great price, this is the best mic that I've ever used on a headset (some people reported a white noise problem, but that only seems to be an issue with the first revision, the current revision sounds natural and clear) and once you balance out the sound through the included equalizer the playback is great as well. I can't recommend this headset enough.",
          "MH650 - this product worked great for the 6 months of me having it.  However, after the 4 months the mic just stopped working.Trying to contact CoolerMaster and unable to get a hold of anyone.Don't buy.  Not worth it.",
          "This review is for the newer generation MH650 wired with larger drivers and software driven 7.1.  This pair of headphones connects via USB-A or with the included A to C adapter, USB-C.  For this reason, it can be used in both a PC or Mac.  The sound quality is unusually outstanding with a balanced bass and treble.  They are good enough not only for games, but they are quite nice for just listening to music as well.  They are extremely comfortable like the last generation such that you hardly notice them on your head.  The directional finding of the 7.1 is ok, but the one problem I had was that the 7.1 as implemented right now does not have the buttons mapped correctly in Windows 10.  The mic is detachable and background pickup is low.  There is a physical volume button for changing as well. This is an acknowledged bug and is slated for correction with the next version of the software.  This pair also includes a nice velvet bag for travel.  If you want a great sub $100 pair that can be either used for games or music, this is an outstanding pair to consider.",
          "mic and sound quality is immaculate.",
          "If there were fractions of ratings, I would put this as a 4.5/5, but the only issue I have with the headset is small. I am super keen on having BOTH good mic quality and sound quality, and this headset does a great job. However, the ONLY gripe I have with this is that the mic picks up a lot of background noise, no noise cancelling that I know of. Maybe its a setting that I don't know how to turn on. I live with a lot of people so it is a bit hard to talk to my friends when there's other people around me. However, if I was living alone, or at least was in a quiet room all the time, this headset is perfect.",
          "The RGB and the software that lets you control the sounds and the color is cool. But the mic like written on other reviews doesn't seem to be working no matter how i change the setting on my gaming laptop. Even if i boost the sound to max, it still wasn't catching my voice. But it catches my breath perfectly and I can kinda feel/hear my own breadth through the holes in plastic mic..  I used to use a headset that's half the price of this but that sounded better. MH650 sounds like i'm listening with my ears plugged. Earcups are super comfortable but it does put some force around head.",
          "I have a teenage son who burns through headsets like they are paper.  I was looking for a good pair of headsets that would stand up to teen wear and tear without breaking the bank.  These seemed like a good price point and my teen loved the lights on the side.  He has been super pleased with the sound quality is great and great for noise cancelation according to him.  My husband loved the looks of these so much he tried wearing them.  Now my husband has a larger than average size head.  I only mention this because on him the ear pieces didn\u2019t fit as well and didn\u2019t cancel as much noise and I could hear the sound when I was sitting next to him, unlike when my son was wearing them.Overall I would say these are a very good pair of headphones and a great value for the price but I do think if you are looking for complete noise cancelling or no sound bleed that won\u2019t work with people who have larger heads or ears.",
          "love the mh650's for pc! a really good pair of headphones that perform above the price! also purchased the mh630's for my daughter's xbox and her and i love the mh630's on xbox! with the mh650's, i use the software to keep them at a flat e.q. but you can e.q. them to your liking. and i just disable the virtual 7.1 surround and let my dolby atmos for headphones shine with these on. they sound beyond great watching movies or content with dolby atmos! and i often find myself using my daughter's mh630's in my dac/amps or headphone amps for some hi-res sessions! def one of the most comfy pair, if not the most comfy pair i have ever put on! the mh series has def found a place on a legendary headphone wall somewhere! will also purchase the mh751's!",
          "My BIG 3:(1) Comfort. These don't feel like they are squeezing your head like a lemon, and the cushions feel like pillows for your ears. Not a problem or complaint after finishing an 8-hour day with these headphones.(2) Quality. The material of the headphones can take a beating so it definitely provides durability and reliability. The drivers are 50mm and 7.1 surround sound, making this headset a beast. The microphone is omnidirectional meaning it picks up sound in ALL directions which is more ideal when having a conversation.(3) Boxing and initial thoughts. CoolerMaster makes headphones?!?! What? Yes. And they did a great job at it. The unboxing experience felt like Christmas back in the 90s when the Nintendo 64 first came out. Oh boy. You'll be excited to open these up as well as the overall quality and feel.Overall, the quality to price ratio is high in this one. You're definitely getting the best bang for the buck and can recommend this for gamers, students, audiophiles, mixers, and casual users.",
          "Bought this headset as I don't like using stand/boom mics, and I had seen reviews saying this model had a great built-in mic.  They weren't kidding.  Plug and play quality was great, and I hopped in a Discord call with some guys in my OSRS clan and they all said it was clear.  The sound has been great for gaming, music, and videos as well.  Haven't had any issues with clarity.  Pleased with my purchase.",
          "When you first put these headphones on it sounds way different than most headphones. But once you get used to the sound these are a solid pair of gaming headphones. Amazing quality mic. definitely recommend especially for the price it is.",
          "I ordered these for my son.  He primarily used them on his Switch and they performed great.  They are a little large fitting for him, but he was able to adjust them fine.  The RGB lights are cool and worked well.  Sound and mic quality were great too.",
          "Lasted me about 2 years and then broke one day as I tried putting it on. maybe I stretched it too wide but seems like the plastic gave out on me on one side.",
          "This headset after installing the Cooler Master Master Plus software and tweaking the EQ, makes this headset perfect for gaming and using the premade EQ for music, it's good for listening to music too.It's not the best headset for gaming or listening to music, but compared to other headsets in this price range, it's better than ALL of them, from personal experience.The microphone on this headset is probably the best in any headset in any price range. It's a legitimately good microphone.",
          "When I first ordered this product, I was very unhappy. The sound was tinny and unsatisfying, but after a few weeks I got used to it and very much enjoyed it! The microphone is amazing and worked flawlessly.Fast forward three months and soon I began hearing crackling in the ears. I figured it was fine and didnt want to replace them for an inconvenience. But I figured out why they crackled - the right ear completely detached, hanging on only by a wire.I ordered a refund on these and was immediately sent a new pair. However, they replaced it with the MH670 - a wireless version I cannot use. I am unsatisfied and never spending my money here again.The attached picture shows my shoddy repairwork on the original 650 to hold them together before I can return them. This is very disappointing.",
          "I have had this now for half a year and it worked well but all of a sudden it stopped working. The sound is all static. I took good care of it leaving the wire straight with no twirling. I would not recommend because it does not last long.",
          "It's decently loud, feels comfortable, is very adjustable, and the small tote bag for it is nice and soft, but the microphone is utter garbage. I spent a good half hour trying to fix it and adjust the level at which it picks up my voice and it is just so inconsistent with keeping that volume. I could be speaking in a consistent volume and the mic will bounce between making it quieter or louder. Also the 7.1 button does literally nothing. There is absolutely no change when you press the 7.1 button. Oh, and you can't adjust the colors, it's either transitioning through all the colors of the rainbow, stays PURPLE, pulses PURPLE, or turns off",
          "I've had this headset for 2 years, and after a while the connector that keeps the ear peices attached to the headband started to come apart. I used a little super glue on them and never had a problem since. I would buy this again when it's time to get a new set, I'll just keep some glue on hand.",
          "The headset is comfortable and sound quality is generally good coming and going, but I've had this headset for about 9 months and the mic is now intermittent as I'm talking, and the on-headset mute button no longer works. Very surprised that this headset didn't hold up. Before this I had a $30 headset from a company who is no longer in business and it lasted me like 5 years. I will be reaching out to Cooler Master to see what they can do.",
          "The sound on these is amazing! The only downside for me was the mic it came with, and I guess headset mics in general just arent the best to begin with, but this mic just doesn't work at all! It cuts out A LOT and just stops working randomly... A LOT. When the mic is actually working, it randomly turns my voice into what my friends have said to be a robot-y voice, and so that's kind of what made me review this to be 3 stars. If you're looking for a headset with a good/decent mic, this is not the one for you! Again though, the sound quality is amazing! The rgb on the side of the headset looks nice too, though you can barely see it.",
          "These were great headphones, the best ive ever had! However, within the 1st month of using them, the right earmuff snapped. I am not aggressive with them either. They are on my head of on my desk. All i did was pick them up and i heard a crack. Sure enough, the earmuff is snapped. Unrepairablely broke . Doesnt matter how good they were, if they break, they are trash. Im so glad i wasted my money on these.",
          "The thing I dislike about this that it doesn\u2019t come with a adapter to plug into your controller. It only has a usb that plugs into a pc",
          "My only complaint is that I had to get it replaced because the swivel hinge broke.  Amazing audio quality, the mic is nice, and cooler master was very nice to allow a replacement.  9/10!",
          "I was already heavily disappointed when I got the product and it didn't even come in a box it just came in a amazon box and plastic wrap. Then they didn't even include the detacable microphone with it. Finally the headset wouldn't work with my laptop because the usb ports didn't have enough power. Granted all my usb ports on my laptop are usb 3.1 and I have a i7 9650h with a rtx 2060",
          "Connection was task, noise was not canceled but sound quality was good. This unit was probably defective but unfortunately since I\u2019m on the Caribbean it is too  much of hassle to return...",
          "The mic and sound quality is insane!",
          "Worked well for two months, then the microphone stopped working. It doesn't work when pushed fully into the jack. I can sometimes get it to work if the microphone is barely pushed into the jack but then there is static noise.",
          "They sound good and are really comfortable with glasses. There are three color options; color cycle, purple flashing, and purple without flashing. I thought I was going to choose one color but it's only purple or color cycle.",
          "It's really light and has good sound quality I can almost not feel the material on my head.",
          "1) Looks:* Similar to many gaming headsets, but not too crazy in the design and flairs, I would rate it as an 8/10. The looks are a bit understated by gaming standards, which I prefer.* The lighting accents are also cool, and understated. Just the thin ovular light strip on the earcup. This is good for nighttime gaming so you're not blinded by your own gear.2) Comfort:* Very comfortable. I would rate it as a 8/10. The padding on the headband is soft and plush, and so are the earpads. Both are made of cool fabric material, and not something like leather. The grip around your head is not very tight, so you don't have to break it in for long.3) Sound:* Very good. I would rate it as a 7/10. I guess I'm used to the higher end Sony's and Sennheiser's, so this one can't compare. But for a gaming headset, it's more than good. The 7.1 surround sound virtualization works great for games, but not so much for music, which is to be expected.4) Price:* More than fair. I would rate it as a 10/10. Cooler Master is one of those brands that are not recognized yet like the top tier, but among the gaming community they are well-respected. I have owned computer cases, RGB coolers and heatsinks from them, and they have always delivered. So I feel this headset is worth about $100.Overall, as a gaming headset, this succeeds. Although I'll stick to the Sony and Sennheiser for my music, I'm glad to add this headset into my collection, and will use it for gaming.",
          "This is Barry's daughter speaking! I am an avid gamer and was looking to improve my experience. This is the first headset I have invested in, and it has blown away my expectations.I was careful to read through the reviews here and on YouTube to ensure my money was worth spending.I have had the headset for only a few weeks, but it has fit my every need. They fit comfortably, and I am a huge fan of the cushioning on top. I love the sleek style and the removable microphone. The mute feature also comes in handy when in calls with friends. The microphone quality and audio quality is pretty fantastic, too. The noise cancellation is not the absolute greatest, but I personally don't have a problem with that; it works fine for me. The actual muffs have a lot of mobility and move very easily, but again, that hasn't pushed any of my buttons. I had no issues with delivery or damage.I am impressed with the quality that comes at this price. I too was skeptical, but I did my research. If you have not purchased a headset before, I highly recommend this one. It is a great starter, and I hope it lasts for a long time.",
          "I'll try to make this as brief and as little frills possible. This headset is great. A bit on the costly side, but I would say it's well worth your money. (I would hunt for a coupon or sale, though.) It's comfortable, the audio and microphone quality are stellar, and it has a bit of flair to it while avoiding the aggressive and gaudy \"gamer\" looks.The unfortunate downside is that it's a metal frame with a plastic shell. Even if you're gentle with these headphones, the plastic will begin to crack if not snap off all the way at the joints. That being said, you will receive a one-year warranty when you register the product, but the shipping process can be a bit slow.This is the only CM product I have so I can't say much more in terms of an alternative. But this headset would be perfect if they would ditch the plastic shell for something more durable like a metal alloy.",
          "Finally what I was looking for. Gamer from more than 15 years.Whit those I can play game, and at the same time use Discord with out any issue.No configuration needed!The Mic is totally clear voice and not need to adjust db.Thanks Cooler Master",
          "I've had the product for a few months. While it was working it was solid quality, really comfortable to wear and had good audio quality both output and input wise. However, just a few months in, the headphone jack stopped connecting properly. Now I can't use the microphone. I've gone through trouble shooting steps, as bare bones as they are. I'd return it if it was within Amazon's return window.",
          "Sounds and does really well had mine for 3 months and it got destroyed, plastic around the whole headset feels like crap very big and bulky definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend this headset if you are looking for long term I don\u2019t even play games that much and this headset just failed. Wish I could have a refund but i know I can\u2019t so do not buy this",
          "These headphones have great sound quality for game chat! I get compliments from other gamers in the chat about how i sound like in using a standalone mic! In zoom meetings, my peers and professor even said they like my mic sound. the game audio with distance in footsteps could be improved, however, the clarity can compensate for that! i purchased these for $89 and im using these over the steel series!",
          "Good looking headset. Usb cable not detachable, but not a problem for me. Mic is detachable. Has 3 RGB animations, looks pretty cool. Good sound quality. Came very well packaged, cooler master has take care of deliver a very good quality product, for the price I think it is a budget headset. Comfort 4/5",
          "I've had these for awhile now and it's held up well. The wire isn't damaged, microphone quality is the same as new, sound is the same too. I believe these are the best microphone quality inside a headset around, don't get the wireless one because the microphone quality goes way down."

I driver audio sono da 50mm quindi il suono in uscita \u00e8 molto potente, ma altrettanto chiaro. La qualit\u00e0 audio \u00e8 ottima e paragonabile a ottime cuffie nella fascia di prezzo tra i 40 e i 70-80 euro. Comprate a 50\u20ac, sono un vero affare! Il microfono \u00e8 orientabile ma non retraibile, e la qualit\u00e0 delle registrazioni audio fatte con questo microfono \u00e8 davvero eccellente, considerando che sono cuffie da gaming. Il cavo \u00e8 USB, quindi compatibile con PC e console. Inoltre \u00e8 un cavo spesso, quindi non si attorciglia ed \u00e8 robusto. Uno dei motivi per il quale ho preso queste cuffie \u00e8 perch\u00e9 le mie precedenti avevano un cavetto sottile che si \u00e8 andato rovinando col tempo e cominciava a causare interferenze audio. Non avr\u00f2 sicuramente pi\u00f9 questo problema con queste cuffie. Assolutamente consigliate se vendute ad un prezzo sui 50-60\u20ac.Contro:- Non esiste un software driver dedicato alle cuffie, n\u00e9 \u00e8 possibile fare una particolare equalizzazione se non con la gestione dei driver audio integrata in Windows.- Non c'\u00e8 un interruttore fisico per accendere o spegnere il microfono delle cuffie, quindi va spento tramite Windows stesso se necessario.- Il led del microfono (di colore rosso) rimane sempre acceso indipendentemente se si sta usando attivamente il microfono oppure no.",

          "Los mejores aud\u00edfonos que he comprado.Tengo 2 turtle beach 7.1 (unos inal\u00e1mbricos y otros de edici\u00f3n de colecci\u00f3n), unos \"republic of gamer\" 5.1, unos Sony 5.1 y estos cooler master, los supera a todos a\u00fan cuando los dem\u00e1s me costaron el doble como m\u00ednimo.El aislamiento de sonido es perfecto, el mundo se puede acabar y no te das cuenta.Los he usado hasta 9 hrs seguidas sin sentir ninguna molestia.Material es de excelente calidad, obviamente no son para uso rudo, pero dandoles el uso adecuado, no han sufrido ning\u00fan da\u00f1o hasta el momento.Ojo: cuidado con el volumen, yo los conecte sin darme cuenta que ten\u00eda el volumen de la PC al 20% y casi me quedo sordo... Con estos aud\u00edfonos, al 7% tienes un volumen bastante alto y de buena calidad, el sistema envolvente es maravilloso, en juegos de sigilo o terror escuchas exactamente de d\u00f3nde vienen los pasos u otros sonidos.Funcionan muy bien con el Xbox y el Xbox XEl \u00fanico pero que podr\u00eda ponerle, es que su cable es como de 150 cm, por lo que al jugar en consola a m\u00e1s de 2 m de esta, le tuve que poner una extensi\u00f3n de USB pero no perdi\u00f3 nada de calidad.Por el precio-beneficio, lo recomiendo ampliamente.PD: Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy, solo 2 aud\u00edfonos (que yo he probado) los han superado: unos beats y unos de la misma marca (cooler master), pero ambos con un costo superior a los $2500 pesos",
          "Nice",
          "I really wish I could have kept these headphones. I have a very small head, and these actually fit without me having to add extra padding under the band. They are extremely comfortable with decent sound for what I use them for (gaming and watching tv). Unfortunately, the microphone quality is so bad I can't keep them. My voice was very muffled and tinny. Turned all the way up, my voice would barely come through and there was an excessive amount of background noise. If you only want these to game in, I highly recommend them. If you actually want to talk to another person, look elsewhere.",
          "No tengo idea que les paso simplemente dejaron de funcionar bien, si no fuera por ese problema serian unos aud\u00edfonos de 5 estrellas, el sonido es muy bueno y el micro se escucha bastante bien y sin est\u00e1tica",
          "bonne qualit\u00e9 pour le prix.",
          "Es excelente me encantaron ademas que bajando la aplicacion de su pagina tiene muchas opciones",
          "Needed closed cup headsets for telephones in a noisy area. Self adjusting works surprisingly well. Audio quality not really good enough for music. There seems to be a defect when you turn the volume down very low on the wire it cuts off the left speaker more than the right (on two headsets purchased at the same time.) You can work around this by just using the software volume controls.",
          "Envoyer product usager et non neuf",
          "I'm only a casual gamer and I don't play online, so I use these mostly for work. I have a lot of video conference calls and Ive been looking for a headset that I could wear for a long call without getting uncomfortable. These are very comfortable and I haven't had any problems with the microphone.",
          "Achet\u00e9 ppur mon ado et depuis l'achat (juin) il tient le coup !",
          "Despu\u00e9s de m\u00e1s de una semana puedo decir que est\u00e1n incre\u00edbles, con el sonido en 2/100 te sigue reventando los o\u00eddos, muy buenos, trae ecualizadores predeterminados en el mando, si est\u00e1s algo orejon despu\u00e9s de 4-8 horas empieza a doler la oreja pero no por las almohadillas",
          "Buen sonido y aislaci\u00f3n, el micr\u00f3fono de muy buena calidad, especialmente por el precio",
          "Se escuchan muy bien,excelente materiales, excelente compra,s\u00f3lo lean bien , su conector es usb no de 3.5 mm",
          "My son loves them. Very good quality for the price.",
          "Its a pretty good headset but I just wish it used an audio jack instead of a usb to plug in because I use a seperate microphone when gaming.",
          "Excelente compra con buena respuesta de envio, suenan de maravilla y tienen un precio estupendo en relacion a su calidad",
          "Mic doesn't work and quality is much worse than the awesome original Masterpulse model",
          "Only thing i dislike is the fit . They sit low on my ears  and put pressure on my jaw. Also the ear piece are angle in too much which might be where the pressure comes from. Ear pieces don`t sit flat on my ears.",
          "30 d\u00edas us\u00e1ndolos y no me arrepiento de esta compra. Gran calidad de Audio y de micr\u00f3fono. El Software no es tan bueno y llegar a ecualizar bien los aud\u00edfonos para diferentes prop\u00f3sitos suele complicarse. Materiales de alta calidad, amoadillas super c\u00f3modas (6 horas de uso continuo y sin molestias). El RGB es muy bueno y el cable de muy buena calidad.",
          "the mic is not the best",
          "Solo sirven para pc creo no sirvieron para mi xbox one y compre diferentes adaptadores y no funcionaron",
          "me quede sorprendido con el nivel de volumen, con el volumen a 2/!00 se escucha igual que mis skull candy  crushers a 60/!00( obviamente sin el bajo caracteritico de estos) buen cable, algo lente de cambiar el color rgb(si eres muy exigente)",
          "These headphones are very nice and comfortable. The headset is adjustable which is great because it can fit anyone. Additionally, the audio is clear and the mic works perfectly for video chats, and I like how you can adjust the volume and mute the mic from the inline control box. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a well-functioning, comfortable headset.",
          "Cooler Master MasterPulse MH320 Gaming Headset with Steel Frame, Self-Adjusting Hammock Headband, and Bi-Directional Boom Microphone",
          "First of all, kudos to coolermaster for making a good quality headset in the low budget range...Let's start with the review now. It is coolermaster which is a brand known for making good quality budget gadgets which lasts longer and feels premium and I expected the same out of the MH320 when I clicked the \"proceed to checkout\" button, but I am a bit disappointed with a few things.Pros:// Design is great with the all black coating and metallic look with the hexagonal ear cups// Build quality also looks strong and if you're gonna buy it, then you need to worry about breakage accidents anytime in the near future// The ear cups with the leather cushions fits perfectly around your ears preventing you from hearing outside noise at the same time preventing others near you from hearing what you're listening.// Even though it is a budget headset, it is perfect for gaming and for listening to vocal less musical audios. I played witcher 3 and I could hear each and every bit of sound effects crystal clear with no distortions.// The bi-directional microphone works good and it is perfect for casual game chatting and also for normal voice chatting purposesCons:** I have found a lot of them to list out **// The build quality is strong and than backfires as a huge negative. It is not comfortable at all which makes it a miss-fit for a long session gaming headset.// When it comes to flexibility, the headset completely lacks it. It is flexible in no way. The only flexible thing is the adjustable headband which also feels low quality// Moving to the audio department, it sounds terrible for audio with voice overs. It is good for vocal less audio, but when it comes to audio with voice, the headset is loud which affects the whole listening experience. I tried turning down the volume , but it turned down other sounds involved in the audio which makes it not a perfect one for watching movies, TV shows and for videos with voice overs.// This is a wired headset, so it needs a cable and that single rubber cable is not long enough. I have a setup with my CPU below my desk and I had a hard time routing it all the way to the top of the desk which made me wish the cable hand been a little longer.// It has a small analog controller for adjusting the volume and that controller has poorly visible indication marks which makes it hard for first time users to figure out the proper control options.// The microphone is a good one for chatting, but it is not a right one for video voice overs and also for streaming, but that is not a big deal to me. The one annoying downside with the microphone is the noise it creates when it is turned ON. From the instant I turned on the mic, I could hear constant hissing audio interference noise at the background which forced me to turn down the microphone when I am not using it. The noise is not audible when I was listening to something, but it was completely unbearable when the headset was idle.**END**This is not an expensive headset, so it is not fair to expect a lot out of it but the sad thing is that it even fails to fill a few basic boxes like comfort, flexibility and things. I was using a logitech G230 and I replaced that with the mh320 as it broke down, but now I feel like the G230 felt and sounded a lot better than the mh230 which also comes with a cheaper price tag.A few days back this headset was sold for $29 as a limited time deal and that is a perfect price tag for this headset. If the price gets reduced to $29, then may be it is a good one for that price, otherwise I'd recommend to looks for better alternatives like the G230 or the 430 or other few ones out there.I have an in-depth review video published to my YT channel, so if any ones interested,channel name -- itassistors",
          "Compre 3 pero dos han dejado de funcionar en micr\u00f3fono son muy delicados no son ni de uso delicado en casa",
          "Perfectos para esos momentos donde no quieres escuchar nada a tu alrededor o molestos vecinos y su m\u00fasica fuerte, hermoso dise\u00f1o y muy c\u00f3modos.",
          "headset itself was incredibly comfortable - the mic however, sounds like i'm at the other end of the house, talking through a paper tube, in the middle of a static storm. tried everything, and finally gave up and bought another headset that is less comfortable, but at least i can be heard!",
          "I am not a full time gamer, I usually game on other devices, an therefore use these mostly for my work. I loved how the sound in the headphones, broadcasted clearly, and how effective it was on blocking out other noises. It helped me concentrate at the task at hand with out getting distracted. The headband on the headphones, were easily adjustable, and sat perfectly to my head size. The microphone on the side made it easier, for me to answer phone calls, and attend group meetings without me having to speak loudly, to make sure that the people on the other side could hear me. Also since the mic was adjustable, even when laying down, I could move the mic to sit perfectly in front of me. There was one con though. I wear glasses, and I was hoping that these headphone, would not push the frame to my head after a few minutes. It wasn't that obvious to me, but once I took the headphones off after a 3 hour call, it felt like the sides of my head were suddenly lighter/ didn't have any pressure on them. That is why I gave it four stars. Other than that one fact, these headphones were amazing, and I would recommend them to any gamer/worker out there in need of a new one.",
          "Mic doesn't work. We have other headsets that work just fine but for some reason this headset didn't work. We tried it on other computers and the best we could find was 1 computer that it worked on but the mic volume was so low the other players couldn't hear me. Anther slight problem right out of the box was the mic seems very loose... if you tried to move the mic up or out of position and moved your head it fell back down again... I was willing to overlook this because they felt so comfortable, but once we found out the mic didn't work we had to return them. Very comfy headset, but sadly had to return it and will try another brand.",
          "Sound and build quality are excellent. Microphone arm gets a bit loose with age, however, but it's very minor.",
          "Buena compra",
          "It has static and the mic quality is bad...it also hurts my ears...but in all it\u2019s great",
          "Sinceramente los mejores audifonos en cuanto a audio que existe, una lastima que el microfono no sea tanta cosa.",
          "I should have strapped an AUX cord to a potato because it would have done the same job.Mic sounds like a hurricane is ripping our house apart and your voice sounds like fearful screaming that has been caused by said hurricane.Sound Works? I guess? if you don't want to hear in stereo.Both ear pads fell of on the second day of owning.10/10 would buy over a potato",
          "Muy buen producto, su tiempo de entrega fue m\u00ednimo, ven\u00eda empacado con mucho cari\u00f1o por parte de Cooler M\u00e1ster, 100 % recomendado",
          "These earphones are so so. I have had better",
          "Pz al momento muy bien bue  sonido y buen micro muy comodos",
          "The sound is amazing but the mic is kind of bad, fantastic for the price though."
