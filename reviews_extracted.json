          "I got this mouse in June 2021 after switching from the Logitech G502 Hero and I've loved it ever since. The mouse is much smaller in comparison to the G502 and does require getting used to but I have medium sized hands and it still feels really comfortable to use. For a note I use a semi fingertip/palm grip where the back of the mouse rests right in the little curve right by the base of the thumb on the palm (that's the best i got).You can use it with with AA or AAA batteries and generally I get like two-three weeks off that one battery depending on how frequently its on. I generally play games 6/7 days of the week and most sessions are at least 6 hours and the mouse has never disappointed me in terms of performance and responsiveness.The mouse is quite durable and has fallen from about 3 feet a few times mainly off my desk at home and at work and there is no dents or signs of damage. My only negative might be that the small shape can feel a little uncomfortable if you don't have a proper space as its uniform on both sides however I will be getting another once this mouse finally gives out.",
          "This is a nice travel mouse for gaming or general use.  I appreciate that it has dual power (AA or AAA battery just not both at same time).  This way you can use easily obtainable ready to go power w/o worrying about charge levels all the time.I have relatively large hands and I can grip it on the sides and rest a comfortable portion of my palm on it.  It is very light so it is easy to move around.  Some gamers may not like that but there are always full size competition mice for those who prefer that.It is Bluetooth or 2.5Ghz modes.  BT is most compatible with many full size computers, laptops, tablets, ECT.  2.5Ghz (USB-A removable dongle included under the hood next to battery compartment) is for more speed/accuracy while gaming.Speaking of the battery compartment, it is under an easy to remove top friction fit cover.  You may use AA or AAA Alkaline or Lithium batteries.  Battery life is typically twice as long on BT.  And we are talking a couple of months to half a year depending which size and chemistry you load up.I accessorized mine by adding the \"Razer Universal Grip Tape for Gaming Peripherals\" for better grip.  And to protect it in my backpack, I use the \"L LTGEM EVA Hard Case for Razer Orochi V2\" clamshell case. (Both of these accessories also avail on Amazon).Overall button feel/placement and the scroll wheel feel really good for travel sized device.  I think you'll like it so go ahead and pick one up.",
          "I was very worried that this mouse was going to be uncomfortably small. I was going from a larger mouse so it was a big downsize. It definitely took a few uses to get used to it but once I got my grip it\u2019s been comfortable. I\u2019ve had no comfort issues even after multi-hour gaming sessions. I actually got this and the Razer Viper Ultimate and choose this one over the RVU because the RVU had some right clicking misclick problems. This mouse is very responsive. I use the 2.4 receiver for gaming on one computer and switch to Bluetooth for my work computer. It takes like 30 seconds to connect to theBluetooth but that could be an issue with my work computer, it\u2019s nothing special. Been using at least a few times a week for a couple months now on the battery that came with the mouse, so I\u2019ve been happy with that. I\u2019d recommend this mouse for sure, especially since it\u2019s often on sale for great prices.",
          "The REVIEW was intended to review the mouse (which below), but here some context for people who are planning to buy used from Amazon Warehouse (which could save a broke college students some money).The picture review: So I purchase this mouse used, under the \u201clike-new\u201d condition. At the beginning, the description was \u201ccome with original packaging\u201d and since it was mark as \u201clike-new\u201d I truly thought it maybe just a mouse that got return for some reason, which as customers we do that all the time. So I did not expect the mouse to come with no original packaging,  the mouse was literally wrap in bubble wrap. Then just a look I notice how much dust stuck in the mouse, as if it has been using under a construction site. This mouse is definitely being used for at least a couple of months or more. Then it also arrive with the battery dead. I would not be uncomfortable if I was purchased under \u201cused\u201d rather than \u201clike-new\u201d condition. I quickly chat with a representative and they hence the changes the description. But honestly that was the first time I experienced such a bizarre buying experience from Amazon. The representative did such a quick job, honestly props to their customers services team.The mouse review: The mouse is nice. I was hesitant into buying such an expensive mouse for works, school and occasionally gaming, but the mouse feel super nice in my hand. Overall a pleasant experience with just using the mouse for a couple of hours. I will come back to review once I knows how long the battery last.",
          "This mouse is absolutely amazing. It has a super smooth glide without being too slippery it feels perfect to the touch. This is absolutely one of the best computer mice I've used in a long time. I've accidentally left the battery on all night and the mouse still hasn't drained it. The mouse is very responsive. Hands down one of the best out there that I can recommend. If that isn't enough for you, you can put a double or a triple A battery in it. it's a nice feature that is worth the purchase alone. Can't recommend enough.",
          "To start off my hand size is 17x10 cm so I have \u201cmedium\u201d sized hands and the difference between this and the viper ultimate was night and day for me. The sensor felt really nice and my first time using it I broke all my Kovaaks and sim labs records. I used a fingertip grip mostly but sometimes claw and it perfect for both. If you use a palm grip you will need very small hands for that. I can Palm it just a little bit. I\u2019ve never had my sim in games feel so familiar. I\u2019ve used the pulsefire haste, Aeros 3 wireless (2022), the razer viper ultimate, and the deathadder v2 pro and this is just the best mouse I have ever used. The sensor implementation feels very nice and the side buttons are very nice and clicks (a huge problem on the razer viper ultimate) the feet feel amazing. I think this is my endgame I couldn\u2019t recommend it more.",
          "More like \"like new\" than \"buy new\". Maybe it's the lack of care in the Amazon warehouse (since it's been shipped from there). The packaging was ripped the seal sticker looked opened and the mouse padding at the bottom was....dirty. Is this item presentable to gift? Not really. Is it still functional? Yeah at least as of right now day 1 of recieving the item.It's not ergonomic to me. But I have small hands,that the mouse is perfect fit.The latency is minimal to almost unnoticeable, I usually don't go for wireless mouses because of latency issues.I'll have to see the battery issue the longer I use it.",
          "TLDR: I was surprised by how much I would like this mouse.  I have 17cm hands, and this mouse fits like a glove, its great, go get it.  Its not perfect, Razer cheaped out and went with a prior gen sensor, and DPI scaling is only in hundreds.  Middle click is a bit too heavy, but I love the tactile scroll wheel.The shape of this mouse is perfect for small to lower end medium hands, I can claw, finger, and palm without any discomfort.  It looks kinda like an egg shape from the top, but it has a really deep ergonomic comfort indent under the side buttons giving you a really secure grip, I feel confident with it, granted I felt confident with my Model O-, but this shape and size suits me much more.  The mouse is also balanced when it comes to wobble, as in there is no wobble.  Every mouse i've used prior to this, even if minimal, has had some wobble.The button clicks are crispier, and more deliberate than the standard Omron switches on most other mice.  I think its just preference, but I like it a bit heavier like this.  Its not night and day heavy and you probably wouldn't even notice unless comparing, but it is.  Side buttons are always mediocre, but these side buttons don't feel like an afterthought, they are clicky and fast.  Scroll wheel is on the heavier tactile side, which is my preference, feels money.  Mouse click is a bit heavy, wouldn't use it for anything you need speed for.It is heavier than other mice i've used, but not by much.  I use this mouse in its AA configuration with the included battery because it feels better balanced than the AAA slot.  A AAA battery makes this mouse feel back heavy and less wieldy than with the AA battery, which feels 'lighter' because the weight is more consistent.  You could get a converter but I think the 75g total weight to feel fine, it doesn't detract from my aim or comfort.The mouse skates are amazingly smooth and thick, they feel better than the tiger arc 2's I have on another mouse.  They have this kind of incandescent shimmer to them on the bottom and look unique, but damn do they feel good.  It is unfortunate when they wear out I wont be able to buy official orochi v2 skates, because for some reason Razer believes you should buy a new mouse.  Corepads and Tiger are good companies, they make good products, but these just feel so good, its such a damn shame.  I play on a glass mousepad, so these feet will eventually wear out, even if it'll take a bit.The sensor is, well its a modern sensor with zero noticeable issues.  That said due to sensor position the DPI in settings is not accurate.  If you game at 400 dpi you're going to have to get used to the additional speed unless you want the potential pixel skipping and slower Y axis at 300 dpi.  I got used to it, but it would of been better if we could adjust DPI at least by 50, if not by 1.  If you use 1600 DPI, you can just lower it to 1500 without any issue since anything over 800 is already pretty damn smooth.  I would of given it a demerit for this since a good configuration software can fix anything, but it didn't affect me at the end of the day.  If you are OCD about it, this mouse will drive you crazy.  If they release an Orochi V3 I hope they use their better sensor, battery life is not as important.  Mouse lift off is a bit higher than 1mm even if you adjust it to that in settings.It is a modern wireless mouse, as all modern wireless mice it has zero problems with latency or skipping.  Some people have had issues though, which appear to be fixed with a beta firmware update that you can get on Reddit.  I cant fault the mouse since the problem never happened to me, but YMMV.Before getting this mouse I swore I would never get a razer product again, the feet for my Razer Naga Trinity has worn out and I was unable to get replacements since no one made them, and razer did not sell them from their store.  Unfortunately, they seem to be continuing this trend, but the big players will make their own feet for it so they've got you covered.",
          "I am on my computer often (hours a day for work and play).  I gamed for decades and always had the best mice.  But, the last year few years I haven't gamed much and had been using something not so great.  I play a game here or there again and decided I wanted something great again.  I want a mouse that will last many years (something that you have to put batteries into / not rechargeable), that is fairly small and light (which I've always preferred), has no fancy lights, long battery life, responsive & accurate, and good quality / feel.This clicks all the boxes!  It allows you to use a AA or a AAA; only one at a time, do not insert both.  The AAA option is for the lightest weight.  I admit I haven't used that option.  I want the longevity of the AA over the AAA (usually rechargeable AAA's are under 1000mah, and AA's are over 2000mah - so you get 2 to 3 times more battery life with the AA).  I use rechargeable batteries in everything; however, the first battery I used in this mouse is an Energizer lithium.  I want to see how long it lasts with a normal high quality battery (so far, 30 days with ~7  hours of computer use a day.  I never turn the mouse off, it is always switched to 2.4 and turned on when I am away from computer).  With the AA the feel and balance is great.  One of best feeling mice I have used.  Has plenty of buttons for my uses.  Extreme gamers may want more.  I barely use the few extra it has.  The buttons all feel good and sturdy.  They should last, I hope.  It looks classy, I have the white color.I like that is has both bluetooth and 2.4 modes.  The 2.4 mode will give you the best performance.  However, it will also cut the battery life!  The bluetooth mode will give you a ton more battery life; however, you will lack some performance.  I have not tested bluetooth mode at all yet, I wanted to test the mouse fully with this first battery before doing that.  In the future, I may switch between bluetooth mode and 2.4 mode when I switch from normal computing to gaming.  I only game say, 1 out of 7 hours I am on the computer.  So, that is a potential benefit.  I also like it has the bluetooth in case I want to take it anywhere for work computing, with a laptop or tablet.  Then, I can leave the 2.4 usb card in my desktop at home, and still have a great mouse for on the go.  When I bring it home, it's all ready again.Overall I am very happy with it after having it for a month now and using it daily.  I hope it lasts for years.*Update.  My mouse battery finally died for the first time on March 27, 2022.  It was working perfect, then suddenly the cursor stopped moving.  It lasted about 2.5 months with an Energizer Lithium (2.4ghz whole time, mouse never turned off).  Not bad!  I assume a good rechargeable (Eneloop) will give me at least 2 months (and with rechargeable batteries, I will just replace every 2 months (maybe even every month), just so I know my mouse will never stop working when I need it)).",
          "The Razer Arochi V2 is a great performer and looks nice with other white accessories. I picked this one up for my ASUS G14 and it has worked flawlessly. The build quality, responsiveness, and battery life are superb. I also have a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed that I use with my main desktop and the Arochi keeps up with it in terms of performance.

          "Aside from it being lighter than I am used to, this mouse works really well. It is precise, the connection via bluetooth is so much better than any other wireless options, and it fits in my small hands perfectly. I would recommend this mouse to digital artists and gamers alike.",
          "My main mouse is the Logitech G305 which I always use with NIMH Duracell rechargeable batteries (2500ma), and the reviews speak highly of the Orochi, so I bought one.My configuration of use is dpi 3200 and poling rate of 1000.Between both mice I have experienced that the razor constantly indicates that its battery is low, although it is not true, it must be something related to its internal voltage meter, it is worth mentioning that this does not happen to me with the G305.Ignoring the warnings from the razer, using it 4 hours a day, the battery lasts 5 days until the pointer begins to give tracking problems due to low power, with the same setting on the G305 it lasts 16 days using it 4 hours a day day. It should be noted that the logitech has better compatibility with NiMH batteries.Ergonomically the mouse is too small for my hand, I like the G305 a little better, I just wish it was a little taller.For those who play on gaming laptops, do not place the usb receiver near the exhaust vents, because if it overheats, the mouse will stop working.The software is not completely polished, it fails a lot when changing profiles between programs, the same happens with Corsair solutions and with Lg GHub. But the advantage of Logitech is that they have the OnBoard memory program that I program the profile directly on the mouse without having to that require the program.I hope this review is useful to someone and thanks for the attention.",
          "UPDATE: I had to buy one for myself mines the red with a lil akira theme mixed in. These things Are too easy to mod and with a lithium battery hard to beat for competitive FPS. Bought this as a birthday present for the wife. I have a G305 which she likes so I figured it was on sale for the same price so I scooped a white one so we didn\u2019t just have two G305\u2019s. I have slightly larger than average hands and I think I prefer the ergs on the smaller razer. I do play claw/ some fingertip. It feels lighter than my g305 more nimble. I did however slap a AAA lithium in a AA adapter. Really enjoyed that I could completely tear the mouse down for customization (There is just something about having to peel off perfectly good mouse skates to get at some screws that would make me not even want to mod it till it was time to change out skates. That\u2019s like a whole year for me.) so anyways thank you razer truly a great idea. Also clicks are nice I like them better than the g305. Used briefly haven\u2019t noticed any skipping or lag. Thanks.",
          "Small mouse. Great for those who use Finger Tip Grip. Not for those who like to palm grip for stability. Claw grip? May be for those with smaller hands. Most of the movement/grip is focused on the side thumb grip and fingers tips. For FPS gaming, if you\u2019re a wrist aimer, this mouse is not for youGood click on the buttons. If you focus on the top end of left and right buttons, can feel a bit spongy--Battery:To reach 920hr max you need to use lithium (vs Alkaline) AA battery while using Bluetooth (vs USB dongle)Half battery life for each of the following:  Alkaline, AAA battery, and USB dongle. So, if you use all 3 you\u2019re looking at roughly 115hoursAlkaline is more common and cheaper than Lithium even if when you buy multiple alkaline. Bluetooth is not good for gaming especially if you play competitive and/or a game with fast reactionary time as you can get spin outs and delayed inputs.Make sure you put the USB dongle in the USB3.0 port (one with blue accents) and not the normal one (black accent) or you\u2019ll get more latency issues60g weight without batteryUse AAA or AA batteryBattery insert diagonal, giving it good weight distributionAA is heavier but weight more centered. AAA is lighter and has more weight at back end of the mouse.If you want your AAA to have more centered weight; you can purchase a AAA to AA adapterNo rbg lighting. There is a minor light for low battery indicator, and dpi cycle indicatorSemi ambidextrous? It\u2019s ambidextrous if you only use main left and right mouse buttons. Side buttons on the left side mainly right handers as there\u2019s no right-side buttons.  Also the thumb groove is only on the left side if the mouseAble to customize buttons. Saves on mouse, not dedicated to a specific computer, and no need to keep computer software open while usingI use this for casual gaming, and travel. Personally, still prefer wired mouse for competitive gaming, and vertical mouse for work, internet browsing, and productivityOverall, good mouse if you check all the boxes: Use fingertip grip, right hander (if you use side buttons), and not wrist aimer for FPS games.",
          "La caja vino rota por una esquina (se puede ver en la imagen), cosa que no me agrada ya que comprar un producto nuevo, con ese tipo de da\u00f1os cosm\u00e9ticos a la caja, me hace dudar de la integridad del producto, al momento el mouse se comportamiento muy bien, es r\u00e1pido, muy ligero, tiene opci\u00f3n de Bluetooth, el sensor usb que trae y adem\u00e1s permite usar bater\u00edas doble A y triple A, lo \u00fanico es que cuando reinicio mi pc o la enciendo, tarda en conectarse (sin importar si lo conecto por Bluetooth o por sensor) y para mi es molesto esperar a que se conecte para empezar a usar mi pc (tengo un logitech que jamas me a dado ese problema),, eso si una vez conectado la conexi\u00f3n es muy estable, no eh tenido problemas en ese sentido, por lo dem\u00e1s un buen producto y aun as\u00ed lo recomiendo (si no te molesta ese peque\u00f1o detalle en la conexi\u00f3n)",

          "To start I would like to say that I have owned several wireless \"gaming\" mice as well as many wired \"gaming\" mice. This is my new favorite. Razer deathadder, several logitech and steelseries.The response time with the usb receiver is so fast you would think it is wired. It is small, though shaped perfectly to hold comfortably and confidently with your fingertips and upper palm. I didn't think I would like the shape but I ended up loving it. It is very light and glides on the mousepad with such little effort. The tracking is smooth and consistent. The lift off distance is incredibly small.My aim in every game is so much more consistent and effortless. I didn't think a mouse could make such a difference after having so many good mice. And its wireless! Amazing.The included battery has lasted many moths so far, more than satisfactory.One issue I have is that the side buttons are sticky. This is out of the box new, nothing spilt on it or worn out. If you let the mouse sit overnight and then press the side buttons in the morning they have a strange resistance. After a few presses they loosen up. Its very strange. You can still use them when you need but the feedback is inconsistent as a result. This is probably just my unit but it may happen to you too.",
          "I've bought this mouse due to my right hand is feeling numb from using Logitech G502. I've used the G502 for over 4 years and the weight doesn't really bother me in game, but lately it's been hurting my right hand so I wanted something more light. First I ordered Logitech G305, it was on sale for $30, after countless reviews on Youtube and Google I cancelled the G305 and ordered the  Orochi V2 instead.All of the reviews will tell you the Orochi V2 is a superior product in everyway. The only problem was the Orochi V2 was $70 and G305 was $50 (but occasionally on sale for lower). Now that price drop because of the holidays the Orochi V2 is the BEST option for a budget wireless mouse period. It compete with a lot of the higher end mouse on the market that ranges b/w $100-$150.My hand size is in b/w medium and large and the Orochi V2 fit it perfectly. I was a little worry that it might be too small for my hand after looking at several reviews but this wasn't the case. The back of mouse sit perfectly on my palm and my fingers are perfectly place on the tip of the mouse. When I place my hand on the mouse it felt like it was perfectly cater to my hand in a natural shape. For example, if you was to relax your hand and just let it naturally curl then place that hand the Orochi V2 it would fit perfectly without needing to adjust or move any fingers (at least for me). I used a AAA Lithium battery and place it on the AA slot for better balance and lighter weight. Coming from the G502 (121 gram) to the Orochi V2 (65 gram) there's no resistance at all when moving left and right and it felt natural compare to the heavier mouse.This is my first wireless gaming mouse and I don't usually care about the technical stuff but something about this click on the mouse feel very satisfying even the side buttons. All around feel great... I only wish they have infinite scroll/hyper scroll like the G502. When I first bought the G502 I hated the scroll wheels but I've learned to love it so much especially browsing the web or reading an online novel. The scroll wheel on the Orochi V2 is also good but I just prefer the infinite/hyper scroll since I'm so used to it.Anyways, I've used it only for a few days and right hand feels a lot better. The numb/pain is going away after using the Orochi V2, I think it'll take a week or two before it's fully back to normal.I'm using a USB 3.1 on the mouse so far no problem with skipping but there is a firmware update that suppose to fix skipping issues if you're currently experiencing that. The firmware can only be updated using a Bluetooth connection so beware. In conclusion this mouse is worth $45 and even more with the build quality and comfort it provide. After experiencing what 65g of weight feels like I don't think I can go back to a heaver mouse or wired.",
          "almost 5 stars. great small shape, amazing minmum lateness and insane battery life. but only a few months in, the scroll wheel started rattling.",
          "I had the original Orochi and want to put this out there for all those interested in this mouse due to using the original: This mouse is not the same, and you may be disappointed, but it will get the job done and you will get used to the differences quickly.Pro: The mouse is very lightweight and still small in size.Con: It's larger than its predecessor, and significantly more lightweight. The weight of the previous generation helped balance its small size and provide a more solid, intentional feeling during quick movements and actions. Additionally, the body is entirely plastic, while V1 felt to be a combination of plastic and aluminum. Maybe I owned a special top cover, but the added weight and heft of the materials made V1 feel like a more solid, long-lasting piece of hardware. I am honestly disappointed with how cheap and plastic it feels.Pro: The body style is very similar to V1.Con: The body style is different enough from V1 that my hands and eyes notice. The surface is pitted and textured like more common budget mice. V1's surface texture was matte, slick, and without a strong texture. The missing hard lines on the body provide less resting places for my fingers.Pro: the DPI switches (like its predecessor) can be custom mapped to another button so they aren't in your way.Con: The mouse only has two programmable buttons within quick reach of a right-hand user. There are no left-handed thumb-adjacent programmable buttons. An additional, programmable button is available behind the scroll wheel, but its placement makes it impractical for anything other than a DPI switch for me personally.Pro: The 2.5ghz and bluetooth connectivity options are not only convenient, but extremely quick and reliable. The 2.5ghz dongle is hidden within the battery compartment and easy to keep track of. The lack of a wired connection option means I don't have to hunt down a proprietary, strangely-shaped cable (from the V1) to play my games.Con: The inability to choose a wired connection makes this a MASSIVE feature loss compared to V1.Pro: Battery life is incredible. Battery percentage will display within Windows 10 when connected via bluetooth. Have not yet tested to see if that's true on MacOS systems, but it typically is.Con: V2 did not come with a rechargable feature. V1 did not either. This was a missed opportunity for Razer, but may have been a deliberate choice to keep V2 at a reduced weight.Pro: The lack of RGB lighting increases overall battery life over the V1.Con: V1's scroll wheel RGB was pleasant. I would trade battery life for RGB, but I can live without it.I love this mouse, but I find myself rejecting it because of the variances with the V1 I came from. The V1 Orochi was my daily mouse for nearly 12 years and I sure miss it.",
          "Absolutely LOVE Razer products. Own the Viper Ultimate Mouse, the Razer Blade 15 and a few other Accessories. The Orochi Mouse continues the tradition of high build quality, responsive precision, and best of all, this is BT and 2.4 so I can use it with my iPad and Razer Blade.",
          "Coming from the the $20 wired razer deathadder, the orochi v2 changed my life forever. When I built my PC I was using the previously mentioned mouse and I thought it was all I would ever need. I thought that wireless and lightweight mouses were pointless. It was until my scroll wheel broke on that mouse that I decided that I needed a new one. I figured I would invest in a mouse that was a bit more expensive, and perhaps even a wireless one if it was in my budget. It came down to the logitech g305 and this orochi v2. I ended up settling for the orochi v2 because it was smaller, and most reviewers compared it to some of the higher ends mouses on the market- if I recall correctly, the specs may also be a bit better than the g305.This mouse would change my life forever. Not only is it so light, but the pads on the bottom made moving it across my mousepad so effortless. seemingly frictionless.  I felt as if I had become one with the mouse itself. It includes a AA lithium battery that is still running even after two months of extensive use. It feels great to not have to worry about cables being caught onto the edge of my desk. I should mention that the sensor under the mouse seems to be positioned a bit higher than a typical mouse would, so it may take a bit of getting used to for wrist motion. The mouse is amazing nonetheless, and I finally came to understand what it means to have a \"good mouse\". for $40 you cannot beat that price. get it.",
          "I needed a mouse that was small factor and worked well with my MacBook Air and this one at least works. I like that it has the toggle on the bottom for both bluetooth or connecting by usb dongle (which isn't my option I use with a MAC).Ive used many mice over the years and this is not my favorite as it is very simple, no lights, feels cheaply made but then again it works which is a lot more then I can say for two that I had (for my PC's) that I could not use with my new MacBook...",
          "Great product for the first year one of the best mice I have used with even better battery life, but after a year my right click has begun double clicking or not registering any input, causing me to stop aiming in first person shooters. This could have been just my unit so I don\u2019t want to deter anyone from trying this product, but this was my experience with it",
          "It fits my hand size perfectly. The curved shape makes my hand hold on to more well. I really like it :))).",
          "I really like how the mouse is light and slim, well built. However, I was trying to use it on a laptop with other wireless devices and it just does not work well via bluetooth - it works like it's a low quality sensor. When I connect it through the built in 2.4 GHz plug, it works perfect (although not using dongle with an USB port was the main reason I looked at it).Finally, if you, like me, were looking for a bluetooth mouse that would save you a port - this one did not work for me (while using a wireless keyboard and headphones).",
          "I bought this for a living room gaming setup.  Overall the mouse is great, but I was surprised by how lightweight it is (maybe I should read the description better).  If you want a lightweight mouse then you'll probably love it.",
          "I've been using this mouse for about 3-4 months now and I'm already looking for another one, this mouse is definitely a keeper, I just didn't think I would have to shelve it so soon. It feels really good to use, it just disconnects sometimes and that can be really annoying when I'm trying to play an FPS. It'll happen like once or twice in an hour, not super frequent but still an issue none the less.",
          "I had the Razer basilisk X, the battery life claimed was about half of this mice. However, the basilisk can do dpi 2250, where most of the Logitech mice can also do. This mouse however can only do 2200 or 2300. I prefer 2250 for both work and play. The claimed battery on this mice was also misleading because it came with a Energizer ultimate lithium. Every other wireless mice I\u2019ve gotten came with the standard copper top. I put a 100% charged Eneloop pro to the mice, and immediately it shows 75% battery left.I\u2019m sure if I put an Energizer lithium in to my Logitech 305s be much lighter.But overall, this mouse is still a keeper. Fits my hand just fine.  Dual battery is cool, but just a gimmick IMO.",
          "The mouse is light and quite accurate as desired, but here are the issues that keep it from being a 5-star rating for me.  1. Signal strength isn't great.  I have USB 3.0 ports on both sides of my large laptop.  If I use a port on the far side, the signal drops in and out giving me an unsteady mouse.  Of note, this is 2.4Ghz wifi, not bluetooth).  2. The top shell is a single piece instead of having a break before the actual mouse buttons area.  So, pressure from my upper palm will occasionally press the buttons (mostly the right button) without intending to.  Many mice use this one-piece design, but the best mice have the palm plastic separated from the mouse key plastic. 3. The laser position is almost perfectly centered.  This may make it a better ambi design, but for a right-hander, having the sensor ever so slightly to the outside right of the mouse body gives more ergonomic/precise control due to the biological shape of a hand.  4. The mouse clicks are sort of obnoxiously loud.  The center wheel and back/forward buttons seem fine to me, but the main mouse buttons are very loud.  I don't have to have silent, but they seem about 2x louder than a normal mouse to me.  In summation, these are the minor \"issues.\"  Overall, I still very much like the mouse and continue to use it as my primary.  It's not as good as my wired gaming mouse, but the wireless ones are getting much closer.  At its low price-point, this is hard to beat.",
          "This is far best mouse I ever tried 5 stars all the way bruv",
          "I use this on both my Mac and PC. The mouse is light, compact, responsive and comfortable to use with my medium sized hands. I use this for gaming on my PC, productivity work on my work Surface Pro X, and creative and general work on my MacBook Pro. Everything works great with the dongle.  I also like the fact that I can easily replace it with a AA or AAA battery, and I have a lot of rechargeable NiMH batteries available at home.The only reason why this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bluetooth connectivity is a bit wonky if your PC goes from sleep to wake and there is a 50% chance that it won't reconnect, and you have to turn the mouse on and off again to get it to work. Never had an issue with any of my logitech mouse, and even Razer's keyboards.",
          "Been using this mouse for like idk? 4-5 months i think and I love this, I have changed the battery twice, but it does warn u, but still I LOVE IT, not much a huge like gamer girl, but this is perfect if u have small hands, and if u like a cordless theme",
          "I didnt know it require AAA battery for use. They still produce that old tech? But it has long battery use. I guess its good enough for its price.",
          "I keep this in my bag for my laptop and table.Having Bluetooth or USB makes it work on everything.The battery life being great is a big bonus.",
          "Sometimes when I click this mouse, it clicks multiple times. I had my partner try it and they don't have that happen. I touch things very lightly and that includes clicking on a mouse and typing (so I need super lightweight keyboards as well or it's hard to press down the keys).If you also touch things very lightly, you may end up having this issue happen. I sometimes play games like overwatch and if I'm healing as Mercy, my little beam will switch on and off rapidly if I start loosening up on how hard I'm pressing. That's not so much of an issue since it's just a game, but what IS an issue is when I'm trying to click areas of the screen with sensitive checkboxes like a doctors office intake form or paying bills on archaic systems that charge multiple times with multiple clicks. I'll be contacting Razer to get a replacement and will update my review if that fixes my issue.",
          "I absolutely love my Razer Orochi V2 Mobile Wireless Gaming Mouse! The sleek design and compact size make it perfect for on-the-go gaming, and the wireless connectivity ensures that I can game without any pesky cables getting in the way. The button placement is intuitive and comfortable, and the tracking is extremely precise, which is essential for fast-paced games. Overall, I highly recommend the Razer Orochi V2 Mobile Wireless Gaming Mouse to any gamer looking for a high-performance, portable mouse. It's definitely worth the investment!",
          "For me anyway mice fall into two categories. Huge and normal. I would put this one in the normal category. At first it was acting weird on bluetooth. If you must use bluetooth I'd pass on this one. I switched to 2.4ghz receiver and it's been flawless since. I like the size. I have average hands I'm 5'9\" if it matters. I've had a few other Razer mice I didn't care for. This one is my favorite so far. I don't game much with it. So keep that in mind.",
          "I used this mouse while in bed when I feel like gaming and it's amazing. I have small hands and it fits perfect. It's smooth feels comfortable and worth the price. I love this little mouse for in bed gaming.",
          "I personally own a razer viper ultimate, but I decided to get this mouse because of it's ability to switch between two wireless modes (bluetooth & hyperspeed/2.4 ghz).  This makes it really convenient for me to switch between my computer and my laptop.  There's a light indicator at the top to show which wireless mode you are in while it tries to connect (blue = bluetooth, green = hyperspeed/2.4 ghz), the light disappears shortly after it's connected.Honestly, while I really like my viper ultimate, I somehow enjoy this one a lot more.  Even though this mouse is really lightweight, it still feels very premium because of the texture and overall build quality.  I'm currently using this mouse with an AAA battery, but I'll probably switch to an AA battery later for slightly more weight and longer battery life.I didn't expect to like the size that much, but it actually feels incredibly good for a small mouse.  I still think it'd be more perfect for my medium sized hands if it was a little longer, but it already feels excellent in my hand.Pros:2 wireless modes (bluetooth & hyperspeed/2.4 ghz)Can use either AA or AAA batteryLightweight: 73g (with AA battery) or 68g (with AAA)Nice textureTactile buttonsLeft & right clicks sound softer than my viper ultimateSmall form factorSide buttons are easy to clickCons:Not rechargeableMay be uncomfortable for big hands",
          "So I have big hands and what any big hand gamer understands is that you either have to get a big ol heavy G502 size mouse or use a certain grip to hold all these mice for smaller handed people. I previously owned a Model O, G pro, and Model O wireless.Having big hands my biggest peeve with all the other mice is that they\u2019re ambidextrous mice so they are even harder to hold with fingertip/claw grips because the smooth, near flat, symmetrical sides. I only really make contact with the sides by pinching my fingers with them. I never make contact with the butt or base of the mouse with my grip. There\u2019s where the Orochi changes thingsThe Orochi somehow is a smaller mouse than all of the above but fills out my hand and grip SO much better. The sides actually have slight grooves so I don\u2019t slip off the sides of my mouse and the shorter but bigger hump in the middle makes me for once actually feel the mouse in my palm if I want. Overall the feel is amazing.Battery life varies of course but I can barely tell there\u2019s a battery in the thing even when flicking and the weight and balance of it feel so good.Mobile gaming is the main reason I got this mouse. I like that the dongle stores inside the mouse, uses batteries so I don\u2019t have to worry about keeping it charged or bringing around extra cables to charge it, and the Bluetooth is good for casual gaming but doesn\u2019t do great with big flicks so the 2.4ghz connection is required for esports games.Overall a great mouse and really awesome to game with and a little plus to it is that the shell comes off the back so satisfying, it\u2019s hard to not fidget with it by taking it on and off haha. Well worth the money and I\u2019d expect they\u2019ll make a rechargeable one with all the success this mouse has accrued so far so if the swappable batteries don\u2019t tickle your pickle, I\u2019d just buy a sub $20 rechargeable battery station or just wait for a new rechargeable Orochi to come out."

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.I don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.I'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area.

The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",
          "For years I have wanted a mouse with the ergonomic build this one has, when I first started gaming I ordered a cheap mouse from Amazon roughly ~$20 and when I saw this and ordered it I was so upset with myself. This mouse is so easy to use the buttons on the side are perfect for gaming keybinds, the clicking is so smooth and easy, and the DPI is perfect and adjustable! You can set the RGB to different settings such as solid color or breathing and more! I absolutely love this mouse and definitely would recommend it to everyone!",
          "I love the way it looks and works. For me, the fit is a little off - If I palm it the way that it's formed, the fit is good but it makes my wrist turn a little too far \"flat\" to the desk. if it were just \"tilted\" so my wrist was angled \"up\" a few degrees it would be great. Also, it is super light. I like that it's not heavy, but I'd like a little more \"feel\" to it when I go to hold/engage it. This is obviously all personal preference.",
          "I love this product so much I am a huge fan of razor and I will still keep buying from Razer. This products overall is a five star really love this item. It is cute and also you can decorate the mouse which is really fine you could just buy a little stickers that you need for the razor customization as your own . Also, it did come with the sticker  which I\u2019m really loving and thank you so much.",
          "So far I really like the mouse I just got it the day I'm writing this, and ok have no trouble. I went from a 8 dollar mouse to this and it is a really  big improvement. I am mostly a gamer so having a gaming mouse helps me get better. Overall I give this. A 4/10 because I have no idea how this is going to work in the future. I recommend and would buy again.",
          "I needed a high quality laser mouse. I play FPS games. Not \"professionally\" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better.",
          "I am super happy with this mouse for the price point. I wanted a gaming mouse to use with my laptop but I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it. This one is great. It's comfortable for my hand and it definitely improves my gaming experience.",

I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.Aside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.",
          "For years I have wanted a mouse with the ergonomic build this one has, when I first started gaming I ordered a cheap mouse from Amazon roughly ~$20 and when I saw this and ordered it I was so upset with myself. This mouse is so easy to use the buttons on the side are perfect for gaming keybinds, the clicking is so smooth and easy, and the DPI is perfect and adjustable! You can set the RGB to different settings such as solid color or breathing and more! I absolutely love this mouse and definitely would recommend it to everyone!",
          "I love the way it looks and works. For me, the fit is a little off - If I palm it the way that it's formed, the fit is good but it makes my wrist turn a little too far \"flat\" to the desk. if it were just \"tilted\" so my wrist was angled \"up\" a few degrees it would be great. Also, it is super light. I like that it's not heavy, but I'd like a little more \"feel\" to it when I go to hold/engage it. This is obviously all personal preference.",
          "I love this product so much I am a huge fan of razor and I will still keep buying from Razer. This products overall is a five star really love this item. It is cute and also you can decorate the mouse which is really fine you could just buy a little stickers that you need for the razor customization as your own . Also, it did come with the sticker  which I\u2019m really loving and thank you so much.",
          "So far I really like the mouse I just got it the day I'm writing this, and ok have no trouble. I went from a 8 dollar mouse to this and it is a really  big improvement. I am mostly a gamer so having a gaming mouse helps me get better. Overall I give this. A 4/10 because I have no idea how this is going to work in the future. I recommend and would buy again.",
          "I needed a high quality laser mouse. I play FPS games. Not \"professionally\" and I don't even intend to try. I imagine there is a need for very advanced mice. So if that is you, maybe check reviews by people who intend to game+stream for a living to ensure you are getting the really in-depth look and the best information. If you need durable laser mouse and enjoy games, and are trying to find that sweet spot between buying quality and not breaking the bank, I think this is your mouse. I probably got it on sale, but my Logitech M500s broke a second time (RIP good buddy) I decided I would just try a new mouse. That Logitech was basically everything I needed and wanted in a mouse but I figure Razer made nice stuff and I wanted to try a simple corded mouse with a few extra buttons. This was everything I needed and more. It has 1) a light on it and 2) some software to install. I didn't really want to but I installed it. I think you have to register. I did. It wasn't a pain but it's a mouse. You should plug it in and use it and that's it. The bad thing is the light. It's a green light and bright. That's completely unnecessary. You can easily turn it off with the software you install and I did. Beyond that, I have everything I need. It feels great in the hand. The additional buttons are in sensible places and that helps with games. The scroll-wheel is just fine. Great mouse! Turn the light off and it is even better.",
          "I am super happy with this mouse for the price point. I wanted a gaming mouse to use with my laptop but I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it. This one is great. It's comfortable for my hand and it definitely improves my gaming experience.",
          "Its a great mouse at its price point. It is a bit big and heavier than what I'm used to. It also lights up green. Great mouse if your budgeting",
          "I don't use this for gaming, as I'm not a gamer. I only use it for office work. Compared to any other mouse I've tried in the price range, this is by far the best. It's comfortable in the hand, it's light, and moves with ease, and the buttons respond well. Not really much more to ask for in a mouse if it's for office use unless you want to go super high-end4.",
          "love this mouse, my go to for years, could be a bit better built and last longer though",
          "I love this mouse!  You can set sensitivity and set buttons to do different things.  As far as gaming mice go, its pretty basic.  That's all I need though.",
          "The buttons are very loud but it does what it needs to do.",
          "it\u2019s good, had it for about a year and it\u2019s lasting well.",
          "My 14 year old bought it for his game and he loves it",
          "This is my favorite mouse of all time. I have 3 as backups in case Razer every changes it. I have small hands and can't use an MMORPG mouse (big sad) so it's helpful to have the couple extra buttons on the side.",
          "Easy set up starter mouse. No complaints yet.",
          "It's perfect for me. It's a bigger mouse and I love that. I have multiple more expensive Razer gaming mice and prefer this one for prolonged use. Amazing price for what you get. It is only the green illumination, so it's not RGB if that bothers you!",
          "i\u2019m so sad that you can\u2019t change the color of the rgb in the mouse! ( i have other razor items ) but it\u2019s fine i made my setup match anyways :)",
          "infinitely better than the $20 logitech mouse I bought for gaming and everything else.  Would reccomend",
          "Ugh. I loved this mouse. It looks and feels great. A couple of months ago the scroll wheel started to jump when I use it. It's a new mouse so it shouldn't have any issues yet, but I looked it up and I guess this is a normal problem for this mouse. I did the settings trick: control panel > mouse > wheel > one page at a time. This helped a little but it still jumps up and down. I would rather not open my mouse up to try to fix it but I think that's where I'm at :/",

          "Good stuff I guess",

          "Great beginners mouse for people newer to PC gaming. It\u2019s not too small or too big.",
          "came in perfectly and works well",
          "For someone who's a big gamer, this is one of my favorite brands to buy from. I love how their mouses and keyboards are especially. For the price, it's really good quality. Very light and easy to hold. I wish the cable wasn't so annoying but it's just something that needs fixing on my end.Definitely a great buy for the price.",

          "I'm currently away from home due to my job, and i'll be away from home often because of it. So i needed a A mouse, and this one was the perfect fit.",
          "Always like this mouse.Works great!",
          "All is in the title... scrolling is extremely frustrating as the scroll wheel bounces up and downs. It started just 4 months after buying a new model. I thought Razer was a premium brand for mouse, how disappointing. First and last time i buy a razer mouse[edit]Well, I cried wolf too quick. I went to the razer forum and a proposed solution was to blow some air to remove dust, if any. I don't have compressed air, so I just blow some air with my mouth, and it fixed the issue. So 4 stars, the mouse is good. I just hope razer would be more cautious with dust infiltration, but after all that's a budget mouse in their catalog... can't ask too much.",
          "1. This mouse is not \"lightweight junk\".2. Braided cables are worse.3. Silicone side grips were never that great.Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous. Let me clear some things up.The Kailh switches in here are mid-weight and feel slightly heavier (and less mushy) than the optical switches in the Deathadder V2. The side buttons feel significantly better than the V2.  The scroll wheel is less tactile (or smoother, depending on how you look at it).This is a heavy, heavy boy by today's standards. This thing is better built than the V2, but consequently harder to do a weight reduction mod because the plastic is so damn thick.People that complain about this version not having a braided cable... you want an even less flexible one?! Razer's braided cable is the same rubber cable with an additional outside sheath, making it even less flexible. This cable is an improvement from years past, but it's not great. Fortunately because it's not braided, it's easy to rip the rubber sheath and shielding off, and paracord it.The side grips are meh. It's a bit more than molded plastic, but not as noticeable as the silicone on the V2. Silicone still gets slippery when wet, so best solution was always aftermarket grips. If the V2 had G703 quality rubber grips to being with, then I could see the grip complaints on here being justified.My biggest problem with this thing is the lack of replacement skates. No corepads or tiger ice for this model. It has the rear skate of the V2, but two front skates more similar to the V2 Pro. If you you like the white color or mechanical switches, and use less than 6400dpi, then can't go wrong for $20 and some elbow grease.Software still blows. Can use open source software to permaset light effects when not plugged into PC w/ Synapse.",

          "I am really enjoying this mouse. Is it my favorite mouse? Hard to say, I have different mice for different things. I have a Naga Pro for MOBAs and MMOs, a Deathadder v2 Pro for FPS, and an Orochi for my gaming laptop. I also have a drawer full of other mice that I enjoy using from time to time like the Roccat Burst Pro that was my daily driver for nearly a year.So where does this mouse fit in? To me, this is the best all-rounder. The hyperscroll is great for getting through long webpages or spreadsheets. Combined with its comfortable ergonomic shape, and low noise and pleasant feel, it is excellent as an office mouse.However, it is great for FPS games as well. The main buttons feel nice to click. The side buttons are easy to find and press. And I have even found myself using the clutch every now and then when sniping. And I have come to appreciate the thumb rest. No more accidently dragging the edge of my thumb on the mousepad.The features do add some extra weight, however. This in turn makes it slightly less desirable than my Deathadder for shooters. But really not by much. I only notice the weight difference if I am quickly switching between them. In use though, I do just as well with the Basilisk as I do with the Deathadder. Both are comfy for long game sessions. with excellent ergonomics and good buttons. I do enjoy the scroll wheel on the Basilisk more than the Deathadder.I could probably press the Basilisk into service for a MOBA. However, I have grown accustomed to the Naga's six button side panel. Since I have the option, I would probably be included to use that LoL or HotS (not that I play either much anymore).For MMOs there is nothing that can replace my Naga with the 12 button side panel. The Basilisk just cannot compete, and that's ok. MMO mice a very specialized thing. If you are at the point where you need 24+ keybinds on your mouse, you probably already have this covered.But, if you need just one mouse in your life, I think the Basilisk is an excellent choice. Even if you are shopping office mice, give this one a look. The Smart-Reel Hyperscroll is a thing of beauty for the office once you get used to it. And when you are gaming, the sensitivity clutch can be really handy.Also, the lighting looks pretty cool and it's easy to work with. Aesthetics are important too :D",
          "I'm a frequent Razer consumer, who got used to have yes or yes, a razer peripheral (keyboard & mouse). this is my third mouse since I got into PC gaming, and I found the \"basilisk\" mouse model the most pleasing and complete for gaming due to the extra buttons it carries specially the clutch button (8 including the mouse wheel) and thumb side skirt that prevents my thumb to drag against the mouse pad.In the second photo behind the new Basilisk V3 is my previous mouse Basilisk V2 that I purchased back in November 2020, (had to modify the clutch pedal to engage the button with minimal travel \"personal preference\") still works. nothing of the buttons isn't giving up due to the abuse of daily gaming and my acidic hands... the reason of the replacement was: browsing in amazon saw the V3 for 50$ and I said: Bruh why not.Pretty much feels the same material (exterior) and skates from the previous version, in my opinion it's a POS. now what has changed from the previous is, that the V2 have a customizable wheel tension that got me used to a certain extra tension. but that feature got replaced with the \"Hyper scroll\" that I'm already finding conveniences of engaging the tension for gaming and releasing it \"hyper scroll engaged\" when scrolling over websites/long PDF documents. This function is mechanical, and you can feel/hear how it engages/releases the mechanism by a noticeable click in the wheel. plus, more RGB in the lower sides that makes it look nicer.This feels it's a mouse that will last based on the similarity of the previous V2 (not esthetically but functionality speaking if you just drag it and don't smash it when you get killed by a scav over 200m in tarkov)Happy little games and scrolls.",
          "I'm coming from a G502 hero. I love that mouse, but it started to make my wrist hurt. The Baskilisk is a bit lighter but still gives a nice heavy feel. It glides smoothly, and the button layout is good (with the hero I'd have the issue misclicking the dpi button) my hands aren't the biggest but I feel far more comfortable with this than the G502 hero. Button clicks feel solid (had it for 2 months now, no problems), Overall a good mouse, and the RGB, if you're into it, is top-notch.My only real con is the right and left mouse buttons, not the biggest fan of the hard plastic they used, but I honestly don't notice them when gaming or deep browsing.",
          "I love this mouse! I have a claw grip typically, but interestingly enough with this mouse I use a full palm grip. It's very comfortable even with long gaming sessions and combined with the razer Goliath pad it GLIDES. I did get one that was DOA, and even though the manual says to contact Razer for support NOT Amazon or the seller, after a lot of back and forth I happily went through Amazon for a replacement instead. The second one came in and worked perfectly so I won't dock a star, it happens.",
          "I love this mouse... but not the complete lack of configuration software for Mac.I purchased this mouse to replace a Logitech MX Master 3 Mac edition, I couldn't handle the Bluetooth lag anymore.\u2022\u00a0The high resolution sensor is truly fantastic, precise and smooth.\u2022\u00a0The feet (gliding pads) are magic.\u2022 The wireless (not using Bluetooth) connection is fantastic, I do not notice any lag, it feels just like a cabled mouse.\u2022 The scroll wheel feels better then the Logitech G502X wheel\u2022 The side scrolling left-right tilt works very well in Xcode storyboards and Photoshop, again better than the Logitech G502X.\u2022\u00a0The shape of the mouse is quite comfortable and the grippy texture feels great.But... configuring it using a Mac is impossible (as far as I've been able to find). You need to configure it with Windows and the major settings are stored on the mouse and will work on the Mac. The \"sniper mode\" button configuration does not seem to work on Mac and is always set to its default (which is too slow for me) and the light settings also do not work on Mac (always cycling through the rainbow).I purchased a Logitech G502X Plus Lightspeed at the same time and returned that one. My hand started cramping on that, the movement and handling of the mouse was, to me, not as natural and the scroll wheel was awful. The software for configuring it, though, was great.A truly great mouse let down by complete lack of Razer software support on Mac.",
          "For a long time been gaming with different mouses that either didn't have side buttons or they malfunctioned, or didn't feel comfortable/were too heavy or slow to move around. I greatly advise this one as it is comfortable to hold even for small hands, it moves around easily on surfaces, clicking is not heavy and pretty satisfying, comfortable rest for the thumb and cool side buttons that do not sink in or malfunction.",

          "I picked up this mouse as it was the latest and greatest at the time of this review. Work paid for me to get a desktop setup similar to what I have in the office so I figured I would see what this mouse was all about.There are many that say it is too heavy and will not be comfortable for long sessions at the desk, but I do not find that to be the case at all. I really like the form factor of the mouse and do not notice the weight being an issue at all, even after 8-10 hours of work a day.The lighting is cool, but I have to have the software open in the background. I thought there was some on board memory that would keep my settings, but so far I have not found it, although I have not spent a lot of time looking for it.The scroll wheel has good feedback when scrolling line by line. There is also a button that unlocks the wheel for an infinite scroll function that lets you spin the wheel once and scroll until it stops. This is great for long web pages or spreadsheets with many rows.The size of the mouse is great too. I have an average sized hand I would say and I have no issues gripping the mouse or reaching any of the buttons. I was looking for something with a little bit more symmetry, but the shape is iconic to the brand and has grown on me since I got it out of the box.I have the mouse paired with the new wireless keyboard that Razer has out and am currently waiting for the wireless charging dock to be delivered, but that will allow me to easily charge the mouse at lunch and overnight when I am not using it as well as act as a hub that both the mouse and keyboard can pair to. I know that is not directly related to the mouse, but it is compatable with it so I felt it was worth the mention.At the end of the day this mouse is a lot like  many of the other flagship gaming mice that I have used from many other manufactures, but I really like it and will not be in any hurry to replace it!",

I really like the form factor of the mouse and do not notice the weight being an issue at all, even after 8-10 hours of work a day.The lighting is cool, but I have to have the software open in the background. I thought there was some on board memory that would keep my settings, but so far I have not found it, although I have not spent a lot of time looking for it.The scroll wheel has good feedback when scrolling line by line. There is also a button that unlocks the wheel for an infinite scroll function that lets you spin the wheel once and scroll until it stops. This is great for long web pages or spreadsheets with many rows.The size of the mouse is great too. I have an average sized hand I would say and I have no issues gripping the mouse or reaching any of the buttons. I was looking for something with a little bit more symmetry, but the shape is iconic to the brand and has grown on me since I got it out of the box.I have the mouse paired with the new wireless keyboard that Razer has out and am currently waiting for the wireless charging dock to be delivered, but that will allow me to easily charge the mouse at lunch and overnight when I am not using it as well as act as a hub that both the mouse and keyboard can pair to. I know that is not directly related to the mouse, but it is compatable with it so I felt it was worth the mention.At the end of the day this mouse is a lot like  many of the other flagship gaming mice that I have used from many other manufactures, but I really like it and will not be in any hurry to replace it!",
          "Got this as a Christmas present and had several damn it! Moments it is a awesome mouse the response is on point. finally QI charging a real plus and the battery at times did not charge it for almost a month and that is constantly using it. Great mouse a little pricey but it is worth it.",
          "Best! Mouse! Ever!Finally found a mouse that is 100% for me. I used every mouse you could think of from Razer. This is absolutely it. No more mouse hunting!",
          "I upgraded from the Basilisk V3 to the Pro and the difference is amazing. Love the feel of it and the battery life has improved significantly. Best of all is the wireless charging this mouse offers. Paired it with the wireless charging dock and it is perfect. No more having to line up the charging prongs on the V3 dock.",
          "My son absolutely love this for gaming.",
          "I used to use a wireless mouse with an optional/charging cord, but the slight lag was obnoxious and I ended up always leaving it plugged in. The cable was bulky and awkward and always a pain, and I could feel it when I would move the mouse certain ways. The cable for this mouse feels revolutionary! I legitimately don't notice it at all when playing FPS, it feels so smooth. It's overall a slightly lighter/smaller mouse than what I'm used to but I think the adjustment will be for the best in the end.A part of me does wish the cable could be unplugged from the mouse just for storage/cable management ease (I use a vertical mouse when not gaming) but it isn't really much of an issue. Great mouse really recommend.",
          "I have been gaming for around my whole life actually, but for some reason I cannot figure out this one button on the mouse not the 2 slim ones are not a problem but it's the one thick one right where you're some would go. I play rainbow six siege and I wanted to put the button as a control but when I did it it wasn't seeing the button. You know it wasn't responding so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to enable this button somehow or it's just not working.",
          "Bright, lightweight, super customizable. What else do you need?",
          "I was a long time use of Logitech with the G502 or MX Master. I had several issues with them like left button double clicking automatically and so was upset by it. If I used Logitech it was mainly for the infinite scroll.I discovered that this mouse also support infinite scroll and has overall the same features as the G502. On top it works with bluetooth removing the need from using the dongle if you don't want to.So I got this one and it works well, at least with bluetooth. I had issue with the dongle but as bluetooth work well I am fine with it.",
          "As the title says, there's not much to complain about from me for the most part, the feel of the mouse is great during use, it's averaging around 70+ hours of battery life. It's nice... besides the wheel. The texture on the wheel comes from a rubber/rubberized ring or band around the rest of the wheel which is plastic and has a groove to fit this rubber ring in it. This ring becomes warped over time and use and starts catching on the back part of this metal hook inside that's supposed to provide the tactile scroll feeling I think (the button causes the hook to move into/away from some notches in the wheel). This causes normal scrolling to feel a bit off, and the unlocked/hyperscroll/free-spin of the wheel to stop working as intended as well. It really should've just been one solid piece instead of a rubber band around the wheel. Even if the hook had more space at the back the rubber band would still get so loose over time that it could potentially start slipping off the wheel itself, but even that would at least extend the life of the wheel.This happened fairly quickly to me too, within only a couple months. For the price I just can't really recommend this, you're paying a premium so the build quality and thought put into it should be premium as well.",

          "My brother like it",
          "i really love this mouse as my old mouse that said it was for gaming didn't even feel like it was made for it but this mouse really feels like it was made for gaming. it feels great in my hand and i like lights. the scroll wheel is also so perfect. it is truly great.",
          "I want to preface this by saying that I came from a Logitech G903, and a Logitech G500 (OG) before that. The G500 was my first real \"gaming\" mouse and I loved that thing. I had zero issues with it ergonomically and I've gotten pretty comfortable with it playing FPS games. I'm not going to pretend I'm an esports pro or some hotshot, but I think I was above average rank rise. That was back then in middle/high school. Now I just play casually and use my computer for CAD and sometimes play valorant and warzone (casually) with friends.The main reason why I had to get a new mouse in the first place was that the left click on the G500 started double-clicking and even sometimes did not register a click at all. I figured it lasted me long enough maybe I should look into the newer version or successor for it. This was the G502. There are a lot of great things about the G502, and from what I can tell this mouse benchmarked that mouse. I went to a local BestBuy to try out some mice for myself, I was not really totally in love with the left and right clicks. They happened to have a G903 right next to it, and the clicks felt way better, way more positive feeling (and sounding). The G903 became my primary mouse for work/play on my desktop as well as my laptop, being wireless and all. However, maybe after a couple of months, I started having some problems with the scroll wheel. Essentially, the scroll wheel would register two scroll clicks with one scroll click, sometimes not even a click. It was honestly really annoying, I'm not sure how I dealt with that for the last two years. Eventually, I had enough and decided to get another mouse. This time I looked at what Razer had to offer. I watched some videos comparing the G502 to the Basilisk and decided to go with the Basilisk over Logitech since no real improvement has been made since the G502 has come out.Now onto the review of the mouse. It's fantastic, and everything I was looking for. The scroll wheel is light years better than anything Logitech has. The left and right buttons are, I believe optical switches, pretty nice. The materials seem to be textured plastic, similar to those of PBT keycaps. The lighting isn't really important to me since I leave it on one color anyway, but the underglow (diffused) light strip is a nice touch. The software is not as intuitive as I'd like, but it gets the job done. I don't play competitive FPS anymore, so I can't talk much about its accuracy or performance but it definitely didn't hinder my play at all. It is way more comfortable than the G903 (obviously), and I feel as if I can hold it all day using a claw grip. The wire doesn't get intrusive, and this is coming from someone who used a wireless mouse primarily before! All in all, this mouse really fit, and exceeded, my needs.",
          "I love razer products , I will continue to support them, best mouse ever made, along with the diamondback mouse !",

          "Edit: Use a solid SteelSeries mouse mat, after a month of use the stakes got scratched enough it'd sound like it was dragging around, and not moving smoothly. Never had that issue with this mat before. Some very light sanding with a damp scotch brite pad made it smooth again.Edit: Synapse started working properly more or less. It wasn't staying on after pc went to sleep.Other than that, this has been a great mouse for the month I've been using it thus far. Had a G500s which only lasted 6 years before the left click microswitch stopped working. Hopefully this one will last a lot longer.Wonderful feel in the hand. The scroll wheel isn't slippery like some mice are. You can unlock the scroll wheel if you want it to spin fast freely. Nearly the same feel in the hand as the G500s.I believe 1600 is the DPI by default which for me is fine with maximum settings in windows as well. You can easily turn it up in Synapse, provided the program is on.I'd give this mouse 5 stars if Synapse didn't loose sync or turn off every time I put my pc to sleep and wake up. And yes. Auto-Launch is checked on, and it doesn't launch on wake up.",
          "So much better than the V1 and I lived that mouse. Great for drafting.",
          "My 11 year old has this for gaming, it fits his hand well, the click speed is quick and there has not been any glitches.",
          "I've had many mice lolFrom the cheap E-Waste to the more premium gaming mice...For obvious reasons, the cheap e-waste mice were just that, cheap, of course they didn't have any weight...Some other mice I've had, were weighted or had adjustable weights...This mouse from Razer is right smack dab in the middle when it comes to weight, Not as heavy as say the TT Esports Black Element ($70 at the time) which I feel was probably the heaviest mouse I ever used, but the weight was adjustable... This Razer mouse certainly is not as light as the common e-waste...But, the mouse has a lot of good functionality, the mouse wheel is adjustable, you can set the clicker on the mouse wheel roll or disengage it so the mouse wheel spins freely, all at the push of a button on the mouse, has all the other buttons commonly found on gaming mice in good natural feeling locations and I like the thumb rest, helps keep me from blocking my mouse movements when playing FPS games...The clicks are loud and noticeable, you can feel them, the clicks are fairly crisp.The sensitivity is easily adjustable via presets or manuallyThe RGB, i'm not really big into, but i do enjoy the esthetic, it is fully customizable.I gotta say, the engineer for this mouse put some thought into it... It's not perfect but its good...On a scale of 1 thru 10, one being crap and 10 being perfect... This mouse for me, easily places at a strong 8, leaning hard on nine... This reason, the GUI for the RGB interface is not that user friendly... The clicker to let the mouse wheel free spin or stay in place is butted up to the mouse wheel and easy to click on accident while in game play... The mouse weight don't feel right to me but thats not the engineers fault, its my own for playing with weighted mice... And being that I am not a fan of wireless mice and keyboards, I do feel the cable on this mouse is a tad short, but easily fixable with an extension... I do enjoy my cable management on wired peripherals :)I imagine for most, this mouse will be a 5 star mouse... I'm just nit-picky :)",
          "My last mouse was the Razer Taipan White from 2014, which still works great but feels like a change. I bought this Basilisk V3 during the 2022 Thanksgiving to replace it, definitely feels like a significant upgrade all around. Shoutout to Razer for the excellent quality product! I'll pick the Razer mouse over any other.",
          "It's almost $200 and I still find some flaws with it. Battery life is extremely poor and despite the high price, I don't know why it doesn't come with a wireless charging port. Yes, you can connect an USB-C cable to it but really? You can't thow in a wireless charger for the price? It does come with USB C cable though...but it's very cumbersome to use.",
          "Wow this is a stunning mouse. I always liked heavy gaming mice more than light ones but this has swayed my opinion. Not only that but it has a very nice clean look that adds a quality look to any desk. Mouse clicks have depth rather than a sharp pointy click, which I have come to prefer. Mouse buttons 4 and 5 are positioned in a very easy to reach place along with the dpi drop switch. Scroll wheel has a nice light tactile feel to it. The biggest boon however is the mouse scroll switch button which feels very nice to use> You can hear the brakes the scroll wheel has engage and disengage.",
          "Really 4-1/2 stars. The Razor Basilisk V3 is nearly perfect hardware. The shortcomings are in the software and firmwear.ProBuilt solid and not a rattle trap like my old logitech.Scroll wheel in clicky mode is the perfect resistance.All the switches have excellent feel and response.Being optical switches I don't expect issues with switch chatterBig enough for my big hands.The scroll wheel acceleration is cool if a bit gimmickyConsLighting profiles can't be stored in the onboard profiles.The lighting is a rotating color without the software. I use a KVM and wish I could just set the mouse to solid color for the systems that don't have synapse installed.The synapse software sometimes fails to detect a game is running and doesn't switch profiles.ConclusionI'm replacing a Logitech G502 and that mouse served me wall but I never liked it's scroll setup. It needed frequent cleaning and the Logitech isn't exactly easy to get into. for the necessary cleaning. (Cat hair). The logitech died of worn out switches. Something that I doubt will be a problem with optical switches. The Basilisk feels more solid than the Logitech despite being lighter. It just feels like quality.",
          "I'd had watching so many YT videos before decided buying this Razer Basilisk V3 mouse because its very positive review. I did not like the shape at first, but I'd have to give it a try.- Ergonomic: 5/5,I believe some people might not like it because of how they hold a mouse.- Hyper scroll: 5/5It kind of weird when using it at first. Once you get used to it, you may not want to use other mouse's scrolling wheels. It is a combination of Free scroll and Tactile scroll where it uses free scroll when you spin faster and switch back to tactile when it stops. Of course, there is an option to either use free or tactile scroll.- LED Brightness: 5/5I believe it is brighter than other mice, no complain.- Lightweight cable: 4.5/5- Tilt Wheel: 5/5Very helpful because I use it very often. Basically, I use it for going back and forth between webpages on a browser or enter/exit folders in Windows explorer.- Button Customization: 3/5The customization level is limited compared to Logitech counterpart. Also, I'm not a fan of hold-and-press 2 buttons on a mouse, so I only have 2 buttons left which I can assign shortcut keys to. While Logitech software allows me to assign macro to a button by apps which mean that a button can have different shortcut keys based on an active app. I know this can be fixed by software update.",
          "I have been using the Logitech G700s for a long time. After the last one went sideways, I decided to try a Razer mouse to go with the Razer keyboard I am using. I have big hands and the Basilisk, although it is a bit smaller than the G700s, fits nicely. It has a much lighter feel and I much prefer a corded mouse to a cordless (too many hassles over the years with cordless). It glides very smoothly on a desk or mousepad and the extra buttons are almost all in the right spot. My only recommendation is that they move the third thumb button (closest to the back of the mouse) to under the second button instead of behind it. It's a little difficult to hit back there.The Razer software made setting up this mouse very easy. I have two large screens, so I like my pointer to move very fast. The software has a huge range of mouse speed, from snail to \"they've gone plaid\" so it's sure to have a setting you will prefer.The colors are also nice and easily set up in the software. The wheel has both free spin and click mode. Free spin sometimes scrolls when I move the pointer, but it's rare and avoidable by switching to click mode.All in all, its a great mouse for the price, and I think I will be sticking with Razer products for a while now. Sorry Logitech.",
          "This mouse is comfortable I used to use the razer viper mini and this is a BIG upgrade",
          "So my first experience with this mouse wasn't the greatest. The Bluetooth function and the 2.4Ghz dongle didn't work with connecting the mouse to my computer so I had to get a replacement. The replacement works perfectly though so no complaints there and really glad Amazon was so quick to send a replacement for me! Since getting the replacement, I have loved using this mouse for productivity and work. The ergo shape feels great and having the 4 way scroll wheel is a game changer for work. I gave this 4 stars though because of a few things. First being the price. $160 is a lot to charge for a mouse, but I do realize that other mice in this category are around the same price, but I still don't see why. Second is the fact that Razer made an extra wireless puck to go in the bottom of this mouse, but they sell it separately along with the wireless dock. I understand selling the dock separately, but not the wireless puck; why not just include the puck in this package instead? Otherwise, I really enjoy using this mouse, but not sure I would recommend it for gaming unless you like a heavier mouse.",
          "This mouse is amazing for playing PUBG. The customizable buttons and the scroll wheel being able to be pushed to the right or left has made playing PUBG amazingly well. I programed the buttons in the Razer synapse app to be for 1 and 2 and it's made it easier to switch guns in a fight or anything else. This is the mouse to go for PUBG. Along with the huntsman V2 keyboard you'll be set.",
          "Not as many buttons as I thought (switches profiles). Otherwise, does well. Not as sound clicking noises as my Logitech G502, but manages with the digital tactile scroll wheel. Great for a mouse with a light fee",

          "I've been using an anodised aluminium mouse mat for a couple of years with G502, but the thing has always been making a lot of noise (the same sort of noise as you would get from sliding G502 down on finely polished wooden surface). These teflon feet actually make the thing slide silently.The mouse comes bundled with Razer's new super-ultra-extra-speed-flex cable. The cable is not just a marketing nonsense, it indeed has barely noticeable drag.The build quality is spotless. Even the mouse wheel that generally makes Razer products look low-quality has fairly nice feel.About the Synapse software. Right after installation I discovered a bug with using on-the-flight DPI feature (i. e. you hold a button and use the scroll wheel to adjust the DPI). When coupled with free spinning wheel, the the DPI keeps increasing even after the wheel has stopped. The bug has been reported, but the very fact that I encountered a bug almost immediately after installation is concerning. Apparently, the rumors about Razer Synapse are also true. Which is bad. Very bad, if that is their attitude.",
          "In all honesty, this is the best feeling mouse I've tried... and I've tried. Searched for ergo mice, tried the g502, nothing feels quite as good in my hand. If you don't want all the fancy lighting there are cheaper options... but they're all variations of the basilisk. And my only gripe with the v3 is the wire. But if you've got the cash, the v3 pro is the perfect mouse. (Which I full intend to upgrade to)"

        "name": "Razer Mamba Elite Wired Gaming Mouse: 16,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - 9 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches",
        "rating": "4.6",
        "reviews": [
          "This was previously Razers top tier mouse.  Featuring top of the line everything from sensor to lighting, to being wireless, to having its own stand.  The Mamba is what started the trends and was the pinnacle that other mice tried to replicate.However, with this, the second generation, Razer made a dire mistake.  They released the Mamba Tournament Edition, trying to cater to hard core gamers, but unfortunately, they chose a laser instead of an optical sensor and it had some performance issues compared to Razers other mice which all used optical sensors and because of this, the mouse got a bad reputation.Razer later released a newer version, updated with THE BEST optical sensor made at the time (still great even today), better than all others, with Omron switches (best at the time and still great today) and it solved all the problems, but by then, the name \u201cMamba\u201d was synonymous with shitty lasers, and so no one went after it, and there were barely any reviews.But as someone who had a Deathadder that finally bit the dust and wanted an upgrade, after testing out every mouse there was, my choice came down to either the Razer Viper or this Mamba, and the Mamba just felt perfect for my large hands.  Thumb buttons were perfect, shape was perfect, and even the side grips were placed so much better than my Death Adder.Additionally, it\u2019s one of the very few Razer mice that offers mouse wheel tilt, which gives it 2 additional buttons to hotkey, which was a game changer in terms of competitive gaming.I still use and adore it to this day and I\u2019ve tried a lot of the latest models and I still like this mouse.  If you have large hands, are right handed, and want a somewhat basic mouse with the best sensor (I think it might still be Razers best) and two more programmable buttons than a generic basic mouse, then give it a try.  It\u2019s under 100g which, although not as light as a Glorious Model O, it\u2019s still lighter than most none-perforated mice (mice with holes all over it to save material weight).This is still the best mouse in Razers lineup, in my opinion.  At the very least, the most underrated.",
          "Looks great, feels great. The middle scroll button is inaccurate. It tries to scroll sometimes when pressing the middle scroll button for a middle click. Scrolling is not consistent with my input - sometimes it scrolls more or less and this is very inconsistent. Sometimes it will work great so it's very annoying when it doesn't work like I expect it to.I'm paying a premium price for this mouse and it doesn't function as good as a basic mouse. It's great that it looks great and feels great but if it doesn't do what I expect a mouse to do well which is click and scroll then what's the point of getting it?The software is annoying. I don't want to use the software but if I turn it off it will default color cycle which I feel like is annoying on purpose so you'll use the software. They spam you with popup ads from the manufacturer so there's an incentive to make you use it or be annoyed. I've had my computer slow down and notice the software is taking up a large chunk of my cpu even though I have a good processor. The good news is it doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough that I'd like to not use it. But again the default color cycling especially at night makes the room all kinds of colors and some are especially noticeable which pulls me out of movies and game immersion. Like this movie is amazing - oh wait my room is BLOOD RED.",
          "Purchased this mouse quite some time ago, it is now after about 2 years in a state I would consider to be functionally broken.It worked exactly as expected for roughly a year after which time the mouse wheel became... fuzzy not at all consistent or reliable. I don't count on the wheel very often so I dealt with that for about 6 months or so before the right click started being inconsistent. I tried adjusting it and even disassembled it entirely at one point in an attempt to fix the right click. I was unable to get it working consistently again.It was a good mouse for about a year and a more or less functional one for about a year and a half of what most people would likely consider to be heavy use with basic cleaning and maintenance. The battery never gave me any trouble, but the mechanical parts of the mouse did breakdown over time.As a comparison I have a little wireless 12 dollar mouse I also got through amazon that has outlived it and continues to function just fine. I understand from my general attempts at troubleshooting that the mouse wheel going 'fuzzy' is actually a common issue with these, there are 'fixes' provided by users on youtube. I found said fixes to be more trouble and involved than they were really worth to me.tl;dr Decent product but with a seemingly limited lifespan on some of the mechanical parts.",
          "If you are a gamer or a fan of Led/RGB lights, this mouse is a must. It is pretty bright and responsive, you can change the sensibility with the two upper button and assign uses for the side button, also the wheel not just let you scroll pages, it also let you move faster across pages, even with out any configuration. You can install Razer Synapse App, but it isnt required to function, only you just get the basic pattern of lights changing, but if you use the app, it let you save some profiles and change with a button under the mouse. The mouse is pretty big but feels amazing in your hand and you soon forget about this.",
          "this mouse is ok. the scroll wheel on mine has started to act up intermittently but other than that it still works fine. Razer Synapse is awful. it's laggy, buggy, and doesn't even perform basic function (like display battery level) correctly sometimes. Especially egregious considering the battery status isn't communicated to Windows in any other way like most other devices do. The \"custom rgb\" color selection is finicky and what the mouse actually displays sometimes does not match the color(s) you've selected even remotely. if you could do things like see the battery status, change lighting, and set dpi mode settings in any other way it would be much better. This product is hindered by being locked to bad software just like Logitech mice and G Hub.",
          "I really wanted to like this mouse, as it has the features and tech that I want, and it's made by a company with good support.  Unfortunately, it's just not comfortable enough for me to use for more than a few minutes.I'm fine with the claw, palm, and fingertip grip styles, so I wasn't concerned about this being designed around a palm-grip.  That wasn't an issue for me.  Instead, it's that it's poorly shaped for any of those grips.The mouse is large, which is normally fine.  Unfortunately, the sides of the mouse make it even larger.  The left side has a slight outward taper, and the right side has a pronounced outward taper.  The tapered sides are covered with a low-friction rubber, making them even more useless to grip.  Because of this, my hand fatigues quickly when using the mouse, as the wide palm and wider, slippery \"grip\" areas make it harder to control than it should be.Typically, most mice (even palm-style) taper inward or straight down before tapering out on the sides.  This allows a place for the fingers and thumb to rest, and allows them to be used for control.  The Mamba appeared to be the same in the pictures, but it really isn't.My son and my GF both tried it as well, and neither liked it.  I brought it into work, offering it to any coworker who wanted it.  Many tried it, but no one liked it.  Finally, one took it home to give to his kid.  I feel sorry for that kid.There are far better mice for this price, for all styles.  Light or not, big or little, palm or claw or fingertip, \"gaming\" or not, each of them is better than this.Maybe the tech is good. Maybe it's durable.  Maybe the quality of components is top notch.  Maybe the software is even good.  I simply don't know, as I refuse to use it long enough to find out.This might fit your hands well.  Many people here seem to like it.  Not me.  Good luck!",
          "Bought this mouse because I wanted to cut some cords and I do spend a good amount of time gamingand  Razer is a well known brand in the gaming community. The mouse is not one of those over complicated mice that have about 13 buttons and a sink stuck to the side of it which was perfect for me, what it does have is 2 buttons under the thumb which are SUPER convenient and SUPER easy to press/reach (suits my needs in World of Warcraft perfectly). It has a little but of Chorma light  on the mouse wheel and of course naturally the Razer symbol lights up beautifully. Software was easy as 1,2....done, as soon as you plug the mouse in the installer wizard takes off and before you know it you are done. I love I can customize the lights in a dozen or more ways using the software and I can match the lights on the mouse to the lights on my Razer Kraken Kitty edition headset ( I have a pretty fly set up). The material of the mouse is NOT what I had expected it to be, photos are deceiving. Initially I was disappointed I had thought it was made out of that soft touch plastic but it wasn't but now I kinda like it just the way it is and think it's a great choice (the soft touch plastic would get greasy/oily/dirty in no time). This mouse is EXTREMELY light  weight for a wireless mouse which was a great surprise (I think its only 4 oz) while my wired mouse weighs a ton compared to it. The plastic the mouse is made of can seem like it's cheap but I assure you - touch is deceiving, it's a tough - durable mouse that's overcome with flying colors being dropped, sliding off my table and *drum roll please* a TODDLER harassing it non stop (toddlers are like fish - show them something shiny or color changing and they are hooked). The overall shape of the mouse is underwhelming  but that's not a bad thing, it's actually kind of perfect truth be told, it fits in my hand so well it's like I had been using this mouse for the last 10 years and had worked it in already...that's worth it's weight in gold in my books.Now time for the bad...The bad...While the mouse is meant to be a wireless mouse there are times it does need to be plugged in (to charge and it does work just as well plugged in). The Razer store page for the Mamba clains it lasts 5 hours however after 1.5 days of use or a full 24 hours the mouse starts to blink red which signifies it needs to be charged. That's rather fast, much faster than I was expecting. I turn the mouse OFF when it's not in use so it's not irresponsible ownership draining the battery. I feel like every time I'm turning around the mouse is screaming at me it needs to be plugged in. I did not enjoy trying to figure out how to charge the mouse - that made me chase rabbit trails. I tried the book, I did't find what I needed in the book, I tried Google but Google referenced some sort of charging dock which is no longer made or sold, I tried plugging it in and charging it with my apple block I tried plugging it into the laptop and none of that seemed to work (even over night plugged in) turns out it needed to be plugged INTO my laptop and the switch underneath needed to be in the OFF position, such a simple thing you'd think I would have assumed that. Once I clued in it charged like a charm.Last thoughts...I love the mouse despite the poor battery life and the fact I still feel connected to wires. It looks good, feels good and works amazing!! Hands down best mouse I've ever bought for gaming and I've been gaming a VERY long time  (23 years to be exact). I will definitely buy another when this one dies (provided they are still made and sold by that time). To tell you how good this mouse feels I told my husband if I was rich I would buy EVERY single person in my WOW guild (retail AND classic) one of these mice (yes it's that good imho).",
          "Great mouse for the first year or two, but in my case the left click button started having issues at around 18 months. Now when I try to click-and-drag, it won't stay clicked. It will randomly deselect and re-select rapidly like it \"forgets\" that I'm holding the button down. This makes it a huge headache to work in spreadsheets on my laptop when traveling. I tried updating (and rolling back) drivers, switching and updating productivity software, Razer software, cleaning the sensor, using the mouse wired/wireless, and generally did all the troubleshooting. Swapped in my other Razer mouse (a Deathadder Essential) and the problem instantly disappeared. So it was the mouse. Which is a shame because I really like it otherwise. Luckily I have a Naga Hex on my main computer, and that has been solid for years.For now, if you are considering this mouse I would recommend going with something extremely cheap like the Deathadder Essential or similar, or paying more for something like the Naga Pro.",
          "I needed a new gaming mouse. I thought I was looking for reliability, for something that fit well in my hands as a disabled woman with small hands and that of course had rainbow lights because that's how you can tell it's for gaming. I did not realize my parrot was going to fall in love with it just as quickly as I did on first use. The hand feel is great. The response is amazing and customizable which is something I didn't even realize I wanted until I had it. Now I just have to schedule my gaming for when the bird is napping.",
          "After using my old mouse for so long, this one feels amazing in my hand. Its smooth and comfortable to hold. I love that you can set up the colors however you want. And all ofbthe programmable buttons are a plus!",
          "This was previously Razers top tier mouse.  Featuring top of the line everything from sensor to lighting, to being wireless, to having its own stand.  The Mamba is what started the trends and was the pinnacle that other mice tried to replicate.However, with this, the second generation, Razer made a dire mistake.  They released the Mamba Tournament Edition, trying to cater to hard core gamers, but unfortunately, they chose a laser instead of an optical sensor and it had some performance issues compared to Razers other mice which all used optical sensors and because of this, the mouse got a bad reputation.Razer later released a newer version, updated with THE BEST optical sensor made at the time (still great even today), better than all others, with Omron switches (best at the time and still great today) and it solved all the problems, but by then, the name \u201cMamba\u201d was synonymous with shitty lasers, and so no one went after it, and there were barely any reviews.But as someone who had a Deathadder that finally bit the dust and wanted an upgrade, after testing out every mouse there was, my choice came down to either the Razer Viper or this Mamba, and the Mamba just felt perfect for my large hands.  Thumb buttons were perfect, shape was perfect, and even the side grips were placed so much better than my Death Adder.Additionally, it\u2019s one of the very few Razer mice that offers mouse wheel tilt, which gives it 2 additional buttons to hotkey, which was a game changer in terms of competitive gaming.I still use and adore it to this day and I\u2019ve tried a lot of the latest models and I still like this mouse.  If you have large hands, are right handed, and want a somewhat basic mouse with the best sensor (I think it might still be Razers best) and two more programmable buttons than a generic basic mouse, then give it a try.  It\u2019s under 100g which, although not as light as a Glorious Model O, it\u2019s still lighter than most none-perforated mice (mice with holes all over it to save material weight).This is still the best mouse in Razers lineup, in my opinion.  At the very least, the most underrated.",
          "Looks great, feels great. The middle scroll button is inaccurate. It tries to scroll sometimes when pressing the middle scroll button for a middle click. Scrolling is not consistent with my input - sometimes it scrolls more or less and this is very inconsistent. Sometimes it will work great so it's very annoying when it doesn't work like I expect it to.I'm paying a premium price for this mouse and it doesn't function as good as a basic mouse. It's great that it looks great and feels great but if it doesn't do what I expect a mouse to do well which is click and scroll then what's the point of getting it?The software is annoying. I don't want to use the software but if I turn it off it will default color cycle which I feel like is annoying on purpose so you'll use the software. They spam you with popup ads from the manufacturer so there's an incentive to make you use it or be annoyed. I've had my computer slow down and notice the software is taking up a large chunk of my cpu even though I have a good processor. The good news is it doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough that I'd like to not use it. But again the default color cycling especially at night makes the room all kinds of colors and some are especially noticeable which pulls me out of movies and game immersion. Like this movie is amazing - oh wait my room is BLOOD RED.",
          "Purchased this mouse quite some time ago, it is now after about 2 years in a state I would consider to be functionally broken.It worked exactly as expected for roughly a year after which time the mouse wheel became... fuzzy not at all consistent or reliable. I don't count on the wheel very often so I dealt with that for about 6 months or so before the right click started being inconsistent. I tried adjusting it and even disassembled it entirely at one point in an attempt to fix the right click. I was unable to get it working consistently again.It was a good mouse for about a year and a more or less functional one for about a year and a half of what most people would likely consider to be heavy use with basic cleaning and maintenance. The battery never gave me any trouble, but the mechanical parts of the mouse did breakdown over time.As a comparison I have a little wireless 12 dollar mouse I also got through amazon that has outlived it and continues to function just fine. I understand from my general attempts at troubleshooting that the mouse wheel going 'fuzzy' is actually a common issue with these, there are 'fixes' provided by users on youtube. I found said fixes to be more trouble and involved than they were really worth to me.tl;dr Decent product but with a seemingly limited lifespan on some of the mechanical parts.",
          "If you are a gamer or a fan of Led/RGB lights, this mouse is a must. It is pretty bright and responsive, you can change the sensibility with the two upper button and assign uses for the side button, also the wheel not just let you scroll pages, it also let you move faster across pages, even with out any configuration. You can install Razer Synapse App, but it isnt required to function, only you just get the basic pattern of lights changing, but if you use the app, it let you save some profiles and change with a button under the mouse. The mouse is pretty big but feels amazing in your hand and you soon forget about this.",
          "this mouse is ok. the scroll wheel on mine has started to act up intermittently but other than that it still works fine. Razer Synapse is awful. it's laggy, buggy, and doesn't even perform basic function (like display battery level) correctly sometimes. Especially egregious considering the battery status isn't communicated to Windows in any other way like most other devices do. The \"custom rgb\" color selection is finicky and what the mouse actually displays sometimes does not match the color(s) you've selected even remotely. if you could do things like see the battery status, change lighting, and set dpi mode settings in any other way it would be much better. This product is hindered by being locked to bad software just like Logitech mice and G Hub.",
          "I really wanted to like this mouse, as it has the features and tech that I want, and it's made by a company with good support.  Unfortunately, it's just not comfortable enough for me to use for more than a few minutes.I'm fine with the claw, palm, and fingertip grip styles, so I wasn't concerned about this being designed around a palm-grip.  That wasn't an issue for me.  Instead, it's that it's poorly shaped for any of those grips.The mouse is large, which is normally fine.  Unfortunately, the sides of the mouse make it even larger.  The left side has a slight outward taper, and the right side has a pronounced outward taper.  The tapered sides are covered with a low-friction rubber, making them even more useless to grip.  Because of this, my hand fatigues quickly when using the mouse, as the wide palm and wider, slippery \"grip\" areas make it harder to control than it should be.Typically, most mice (even palm-style) taper inward or straight down before tapering out on the sides.  This allows a place for the fingers and thumb to rest, and allows them to be used for control.  The Mamba appeared to be the same in the pictures, but it really isn't.My son and my GF both tried it as well, and neither liked it.  I brought it into work, offering it to any coworker who wanted it.  Many tried it, but no one liked it.  Finally, one took it home to give to his kid.  I feel sorry for that kid.There are far better mice for this price, for all styles.  Light or not, big or little, palm or claw or fingertip, \"gaming\" or not, each of them is better than this.Maybe the tech is good. Maybe it's durable.  Maybe the quality of components is top notch.  Maybe the software is even good.  I simply don't know, as I refuse to use it long enough to find out.This might fit your hands well.  Many people here seem to like it.  Not me.  Good luck!",
          "Bought this mouse because I wanted to cut some cords and I do spend a good amount of time gamingand  Razer is a well known brand in the gaming community. The mouse is not one of those over complicated mice that have about 13 buttons and a sink stuck to the side of it which was perfect for me, what it does have is 2 buttons under the thumb which are SUPER convenient and SUPER easy to press/reach (suits my needs in World of Warcraft perfectly). It has a little but of Chorma light  on the mouse wheel and of course naturally the Razer symbol lights up beautifully. Software was easy as 1,2....done, as soon as you plug the mouse in the installer wizard takes off and before you know it you are done.

          "I love this mouse! I've used it both at home for gaming and at work. The thing has been a champ in my backpack. Love how light, comfortable, and flexible it is.I only have two problems with it:1. I hate that Windows basically requires you to install the Razer software (it will automatically try to install it as soon as the mouse is plugged in). Luckily on Ubuntu, it works out of the box with no software required. But that's the life of modern gaming. You've got your software for your mouse, another for your keyboard, another for your headset, another for your harddrive, and on and on. Unless you choose one company for it all, I guess.2. The second problem is the buttons. After two and a half years of faithful service, my left click button has developed the dreaded issue I've seen others mention. When clicked down, the button will multi-click, instead of staying clicked. This makes drag and drop functionality impossible.But hey, I love Razer mice. I already have two, and I just ordered another wireless one to replace this. I'll miss you, Mamba. We've built some beautiful things together. I would definitely rate it lower if I had bought it for full price though. It goes on discount often. Buy it then!",

The provided cable has two grooves cut into it that are able to slide past the plastic tabs, which is why it's the only one of my 20+ microUSB cables that works with the thing. Don't misplace your cable if you want to be able to charge it.",

          "It gets 4 stars because I think this mouse is super freakin nice and also beautiful. The ergonomics, sensor, buttons switches, scroll wheel, feet, rubberized side grips and overall build quality are top notch there are just 2 problems for me:1 -At 96 grams (I've seen it weight in at 100 grams on some scales) It's just too heavy to make it a good gaming mouse and the weight even effects it's use for productivity. This thing feels like a brick to me. I personally really like lightweight mice, extra weight makes every movement less efficient. It also makes it more difficult to pick up off the mouse pad everytime you lift-off. It's a bummer because this mous is basically perfect in every other aspect. If you like heavy mice this might be the one for you.2- also (a smaller problem) is that the cable could be a lot more flexible it's way too stiff especially when compared to the glorious cables which are the best I've tried, it's even stiffer than my Deathadder V2. Overall though I can live with the cable, you still can't feel it when using the mouse.I'm still using the mouse and deciding whether to keep it or not, I really really like it, the cable is acceptable, but the only remaning question is, can I live with the extra weight?",

The pros of the mouse is that it has a very nice ergonomic design and this mouse is built for the people who like to \"palm\" their mouse. Another pro is the wireless setting is a very nice addition to this mouse and I love it, the battery also seems to hold up very well (the battery life lasts about 24-48 hours depending on how long you charge it). The mouse is also lightweight which is very nice when playing games. Now there are a few cons of this mouse such as the left click not working very well, sometimes I will try to shoot a gun in a fps game and it wont fire at all (I have found it very annoying sometimes). However it seems to go away after sometime. Another con is the dpi wont change if you have the mouse on wireless mode. But other than that it is a very nice mouse and would recommend.",

          "This mouse surprised me. I read so many bad reviews about the mouse itself or the software and I am so shocked that people feel the way they do. Sure the software isn't the best it could be but it works well and gets the job done. But I'll say I do not mess with it too much once I have things set how I like.I have been through so many mice over the last year.Coolermaster CM710 (incredible mouse but too small for my hands)Zowie EC2 (very slick and slips in my hands but is a good size. Cable is unbelievably thick and stiff though)Logitech G403 (as a mouse it's a great design but logitech's software is miserable and doesn't recognize the mouse half the time and between two of these G403's the left click went out within 2mo of playing FPS games where it became incredibly inconsistent in registering the click)Glorious Model D (great mouse overall but the cord got annoying. The Coolermaster cable is similar to this one but doesn't flail around and land on your hand like this one's does and even their own mouse bungee didn't secure the cord as it would slip out of the connector - but great quality mouse)Going through these mice is what led me to finally going with the Razer Mamba. I was ready to get away from dealing with cables now that the wireless tech seems to finally be here and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I have spent hundreds on them over the last year and I wasn't sure I'd like Razer so I wanted to keep the investment minimal. Well, despite buying this at a pretty low price (I believe around $50) it has become a top 3 favorite mouse for me. I know it's not some super fancy mouse with tons of features but all I really cared about was reliable wireless, forward/back buttons, a nice fit for my hand, not too heavy.So far after about 2 months this has been THE mouse for me. I don't know a lot about other Razer products but I will say that I will look to their mice before any other brand unless I experience something worth skipping them and so far I'm not seeing that happening. I will update if it does since i've only had it about 50 days but so far so great!",

          "This mouse is awesome!Before I bought the Mamba Wireless I used to own a Wired Deathadder Elite, but I noticed that sometimes clicks wouldn't register, so I knew it was time to upgrade. I decided to go wireless this time so that I wouldn't have to deal with anymore cables (Apart from the charging cable), and I think I made a very good choice.For those that complain about the amount of time you get for a full charge, this issue is completely mitigated if you charge the mouse every night before you go to sleep, which is what I do. Every morning I wake up, I have a full charge ready to go. Other than that, the ergonomics for me at least are a bit off since I have slightly bigger hands, but I can still manage with it.Apart from being a great gaming mouse (With all the programmable buttons, profiles, DPI stages, etc etc), it works nicely as a good general purpose mouse.I only have two nitpicks, 1 is that sometimes the lights change when I don't want it to, but I suspect this just might be a result of Synapse 3 not working well, and my other nitpick is how the mouse behaves when you plug it in to charge:- When the charging cable is plugged in directly to the computer and you plug the mouse in, it turns off for a second or two and then comes back on, to which you can continue to use it normally.- When the charging cable is not plugged into the computer (maybe via a brick in an outlet or a power strip that has USB ports (this is how I charge my mouse)), even if the mouse is on, the mouse will turn off and not turn back on.Strange behavior, but concerning how I never use it plugged in but wireless (that's the point, isn't it?), I have had no problems.Overall, I got this mouse on sale for $45, and I think it was a great choice. I would definitely recommend this mouse for others to use.",
          "I decided to finally update my aging Logitech gaming mouse. Had 2 Logitech gaming mice and still using the 2and one on my laptop now.This Razer mouse has a much nicer feel overall, it is amazing at how well it responds to your movement.The mouse is a good sized, nicely weighted comfortable feeling in the hand mouse.If you own a Razer chroma keyboard then you already know you need to connect to the internet to use more advanced features.I own a Black Widow keyboard and as soon as I connected the mouse they recognized each other and updated software downloaded and installed dated my reviewing it.The new arrangement now allows both devices to have the same pr similar light functions. This is pretty cool looking if you ask me.If LED is not your thing then by all means skip on any noise with LED features.However, if like me you got a Razer chroma keyboard then you love your LED lights.Now the lights on the mouse as is with the keyboard are the icing on the already amazing cake. And, unlike Portal thos cake is real.The wheel is amazingly sensitive. Has a lumpy rubberized surface making it very nice to touch and use.The wheel has multiple click options one being a light press you can access the menu options to open a new tab and such.Press a little harder or a normal press on my old gaming mouse and it allows you to scroll around the screen just by moving the mouse. That one takes getting used to. Not sure if this is something you can change yet.Theforqard and back buttons are located spot on perfect for my hands. I am a size large glove to give you a reference.You can use the DPI buttons right in front of the wheel to adjust things on the fly. And, let me tell you this  is amazing when you need the accuracy for certain needs and don't for others.The only con I can think of is the price point.However, for that price you get one amazing mouse.Also, to add more icing ot sprinkles to the cake you get some cool Razer themed stickers My Balckwidow keyboard didn't come with stickers that I recall.Overall this is a wonderful mouse packed with all sorts of actual features. With the added fun of LED light and ddcdirent and new modes compared to my keyboard. Works flawlessly with my Razer keyboard.Highly recommend.",
          "I'm on my second one of these. Why 2nd? Well, you see I'm quite the gamer and it seems that my body heat melted the adhesive on the side where I rest my thumb. It started leaking gooey stuff out of the sides then the rubber part just came off and under it was a gel residue.This aside, it's pretty cheap, fits my hand, has performance enhancing RGB, and it took a couple years for the above thing to happen.",
          "I've been using the Deathadder Elite for awhile now, but I've run through two of them already where they suffer the same problem: Double-clicking and ghost-clicking.Mamba Elite? No double-clicking and no ghost-clicking. Just a simple mouse with sleek RBG you can actually see that actually works with Synapse Chroma. It has a mid-high profile so it fits well in the palm as I tend to hold the mouse towards the back. The cord is braided and lightweight so it doesn't bunch up as easily. It glides across most mousepads with relative ease, but not too much to go flying off your desk.The sides of the mouse, typically where you grip, have a nice rubberized texture. I've never had issues holding onto a mouse, but it does help. The side mouse buttons are almost flush with the form factor of the mouse, but they're still easy to press and distinguish from each other without having any mis-clicks.Clicking is kind of loud. It's pretty standard for these kind of mice from Razer. Scroll wheel is slightly more forward than I prefer, but it's probably to fit the DPI buttons as there are two different ones so you're not slam shifting just one of them to cycle.The worst part of this mouse that I personally don't like is that it has a two-stage scroll wheel button. You press lightly for the first click and then slightly harder for the second click. While having more buttons without putting additional buttons on the mouse is often a great idea ... This two-stage scroll wheel button is not ideal. You /will/ find yourself pressing your scroll wheel button and hitting BOTH clicks almost every time when you only intend to do one. To make matters worse, the scroll wheel will also register scrolling while clicking as well which can be a nightmare while gaming. Not to mention it's actually really easy to accidentally click the scroll wheel when just scrolling regardless of hand posture.Not a deal breaker, but it means I have to remap controls from scroll wheel or disable any hotkeys because I got tired of accidentally chucking lethal grenades in Call of Duty when I meant to switch weapons.",
          "UPDATE:The videogame I play (quakelive) requires me to press both mouse buttons at the same time. For some reason, when I do this, the mouse won't work when you press both of them. Really annoying. It's like if the interface was designed to pick up clicks from a single button at a time. I will keep this mouse because it's comfortable to use if you aren't gaming, but I will definitely recommend a different one for gaming.-----------------------------I just received my new Razer Mamba wireless mouse, and I'm honestly very satisfied with it. It feels good in my hand, the clicks feel good, and it's very responsive. I always wanted to get a Razer mouse, so as a first time Razer user I think it's a great starting point.WHAT I LOVE:- RGB Effects: I used Chroma Studio to create led effects. You can set the lights to change color or to light up from your microphone or speaker sounds, you can set light effects when clicking the mouse, you can make it \"breathe\", etc... You can pretty much create any visual effect you want with it.- Ergonometric Design: My hand feels very comfortable when using this mouse!- Smoothness: I got a goliathus mouse pad as I'm always carrying my laptop around. Combining this mouse with a \"low end\" razer mouse pad is enough to get a great experience from this mouse.- Mouse Wheel Grip: The mouse wheel has little studs which helps you get a better grip when spinning it. I really liked this feature.- Side Buttons: The side buttons don't get in the way when grabbing the mouse. You won't be clicking them by accident or anything.RESPONSES TO BAD COMMENTS- Not Being Able to Use It When Charging: This is not true. I just tested it, and it works! Windows just automatically installs a new driver to use it as a regular wired mouse. I reckon people's windows security settings were blocking the download of the new driver?- Clicking and Dragging Issues:  I haven't had any issues so far. I'll update post if the problem develops.- Bad Battery Life: I charged it 20 hours ago, and I'm still at 85%. I give my mouse heavy use doing CAD models and gaming in my free time. I'm very surprised I haven't needed to charge it considering I'm running a ton of RGB effects when clicking, \"breathing\" effects, and when I speak on the microphone.- Razer Synapse Software: I honestly don't understand why people were having issues with the software not being compatible with the mouse. The software has a super easy user interface and it works very well.- Need to Turn Off After Use: A lot of people said they needed to turn their mouse off after use to avoid battery drainage. I don't think this is necessary. The mouse goes to sleep mode when you don't use it. I left it on all night list night, and it did not drain my battery.Honestly, if you like how the mouse looks, buy it and give it a try! I feel satisfied with this mouse so far, so I would recommend it to anyone.",
          "Overall:Mouse feels good, buttons are responsive, software has a lot of flexibility. My only two complaints are below.Battery life:This could be a 5-star mouse if not for the terrible battery life. It only lasts me 3-4 days before I have to plug it in. Meanwhile, my standard wireless office mouse has no problem running literal years on 2xAA batteries. I really would prefer if the mouse just used AA instead of the internal battery. They would last longer and when they run out, I could simply replace them instead of having to plug in. Also the micro USB port on the mouse has a weird shape to it so that you can only use the cable it comes with. Really bad design on that. I just use it as a wired mouse at this point.Software:It's a huge improvement to the Logitech software I'm coming from: far more intuitive and generally more dependable. However, it's still not 100% at loading up the correct profile for a game. Usually works, but when it doesn't I have to tab out and manually select it. Can be really frustrating for games where the first few seconds of a match are critical.",
          "Mouse works great, high resolution.No idea what sleep mode is, colors maybe?  I dunno, don't care.It is fairly comfortable, but i occasionally hit the center buttons when I get tired.Biggest issue is the bottom isn't absolutely flat, lots of little grooves, so it gets stuff in there, and when combined with a hard razor mat, it means it frequently doesn't move quite right.",
          "I'm a big fan of Razer peripherals for gaming. I use a Razer mouse on my gaming PC. At my office, I wanted a new mouse that didn't suck. While not strictly for gaming, a good gaming mouse is also a really good productivity mouse.I use it with a 2018 Mac Mini. It's excellent, ergonomically very good, comfortable, reliable, and accurate. It's light, it slides easily across a desk mat. It's everything a great mouse should be.I have two primary concerns.First, the software. The software actually forced me to reinstall macOS. Scrolling through Reddit and elsewhere; apparently that's a common issue. The website does NOT state that it's compatible with the latest macOS, but it also fails to mention such an OS-breaking compatibility issue. (Once installed, it won't boot). There is no software, therefore, for macOS. I realize this is a gaming mouse and Mac gaming is almost nonexistant, so I'm not docking any points here. Still, for those who use this mouse for creative uses or even for simple productivity; it's a shame there isn't decent macOS software. To be clear, it still works just fine. Even DPI switching using the top buttons. But I can't see current battery charge state or control the RGB lighting.I did dock a star because of battery life. It's worse than any wireless mouse I've owned. There's a claimed 50 hours, which is already pretty low-- but acceptable. However what isn't stated is how poor the standby battery life is. It needs charged every few days. My Apple Magic Mouse, and even my old wireless no-name mouse from the mid 2000's that uses a single rechargeable triple A battery will last for weeks.The mouse does go into standby and turn off the RGB (and without macOS software, I can't permanently turn off the RGB to save battery). I'm still giving it 4 stars, I'm still happy I have it. It's certainly not difficult to charge and unlike some (looking at you, Magic Mouse) it can be used while charging. I could even use it as a wired mouse if I wanted, and the cable to do so is included. Still, I would be a lot happier with it if it could handle one full workweek without needing to be charged.",
          "This mouse is almost perfect for me. It fits big hands, in fact, I downgraded from a Viper Ultimate to this one, because unfortunately, the lower height of the Viper Ultimate made it uncomfortable to use at this hand size. Although this one has a similar feel, overall it's much better.It's not comfortable to rest your pinky and ring fingers on the edge of the button, on the edge of the indentation. So with thick fingers, these two fingers come together and stick together on the right side of the mouse, which is not a comfortable feeling, especially when playing. But it's still better than the Ultimate, which is lower.Perhaps what might cause a problem, later on, is the unique cable for charging. I can't even plug in the thinnest micro USB cable, because the two guide rails that the factory cable runs/attaches to won't let even the smallest headed cable in.  Of course, this design is understandable, as it keeps the cable stable so it doesn't fall out during use.I've only had it for two months, so of course, I don't know what it will look like in a year. But for now, it's almost perfect.The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth is that it's almost nowhere to be found. That leaves Amazon in the US, where it costs almost $32 including customs, which is almost half the purchase price. However, on Razer's site, for the big hand, for full grip/fps, this is the only recommended/available model without thousands of unnecessary buttons.",
          "Amazing for what you pay for it. It's heavy enough yet light that it doesn't feel like some of the 'cheaper' mice you might end up finding. It has a lot of functionality. The left click is quiet enough that you can't hear it over my microphone. The right click feels kinda.. gummy. Almost like it doesn't want to click. (I don't mind it that much.) The thumb side buttons are so LOUD. And I never remember that my scroll wheel has the function to click to the left or the right.. so there is that.Customizing the DPI is nice though. I set mine to 3500 and it feels amazing. It can be set from 100 all the way up to 16000.Honestly have to say its a really nice mouse. The color changing options with Razers program Chroma and everything else made it so I could match the color to all my LEDs and RGB inside my tower.I'd say over all a 4/5 just because of the differences in the clicks on the mouse and the loud clicks the thumb side mouse buttons make.",
          "I went through almost every major flagship mouse from all major manufacturers before I found the wireless Mamba. All the Logitech mice felt better shaped initially, but after longer usage I would begin getting a hand cramp. There was just something missing with the Corsair mice I couldn't place. They felt cheap and the mice didn't glide as easily as I like on the pad. I even considered going wired before spending $100 on a mouse, but I decided to try it out because I have a fanatical Razor friend that swears by his Razor mice....yes, \"mice\".So, I bought this mouse after trying the grip out at the store. My first impression is how much I love the slightly raised rubber grips on the sides that allow for easy pickup and movement. Second, I loved that with my rather extreme claw grip it fit me pretty well. After installing the software and using it on my desktop I have to say that it has THE SMOOTHEST sensor I've felt. It's just beyond all others, and I love the Synapse software that allows for DPI shift programming, lighting customization, and custom profiles.Next, my concern was the battery life because with the highest ends of the other brands I was lucky to get 2 days of \"meh\" usage....not heavy or light. The first thing I did in Synapse is disable the LEDs on this mouse, and I continued to use the mouse as I would have my Logitech Marathon I had been trying to break away from. So, leaving the mouse on/standby and probably 4-5 hours of use per day after work and 4-8 hours on the weekend, I went nearly 2 weeks without needing a charge! WOW!!!! Freaking amazing! It's held up too!I did run into one small issue that was throwing me off, though. I've kept my mouse receiver dongle in the same port for years because it's a good reception location, but with the Mamba I started having weird mouse reporting behavior with battery life and profile switching not working. It turned out that it was USB3 port causing interference, so I moved it to USB2 and it seems resolved now. This is a bit odd because my Marathon never cared, but not a huge deal.After 3 hours of Borderlands no cramping, good battery life, amazing feel, and great customization, I could not be happier with my ultimate choice!! ... unless they added hyper scroll option for the scroll wheel like I had on my Marathon. Man, I miss that, but this mouse is awesome!! Make no mistake! I'm very happy with it, and I may have to go to Razor first on future mouse shopping!",
          "Me likey:+ Features a rechargeable battery+ It supports both wireless and wired connection+ If you like other Razer mice, it doesn\u2019t stray too far from the design+ It\u2019s reliable and accurate+ I got it for about $40Trying to think of some cons for my list, and I just can\u2019t find any. Sure, there are cheaper mice, and the ergonomics of each mouse is subjective, but I don\u2019t have any legitimate complaints. The wireless Mamba has everything I\u2019m looking for: An accurate, reliable gaming mouse that supports both wireless and wired connections, without the need for AA batteries."

          "I wanted a decent gaming mouse that was a bit better than average, but not crazy expensive. I managed to pick up the mouse and charging dock combo for under $100. First impressions were very good. It's well made, battery seems to get about 20-30ish hours of use before it needs a charge, although I leave it on the dock when it's not in use so it's never an issue. I wanted something a bit larger than average to fit my hands (I wear an XL glove, for reference), and the reviews that made this claim were right on - it's basically the perfect size.Buttons are well placed and feel sturdy, and I love the adjustable wheel resistance to get it just the way you want. This is my first mouse with a thumb rest and I'll never go back. There's plenty of sensitivity there. The only time I feel more than 20,000DPI would be needed is if you're playing on a 85\" 4K monitor at full res, or you're expecting way too much from a upper-mid-range gaming mouse. This one edged out the Logitech G502 for me because of the sale price I was able to get, and the option of the charging dock.My only gripes with the hardware are the power \"stubs\" on the charging dock (takes a few wiggles to get the mouse to sit on it properly), and the micro-USB charging port on the mouse itself (it's molded so it will only take a cable with a proprietary molded pigtail). These aren't huge issues, although if the cable were to ever break, you'd need to buy that specific cable and not just any micro-USB. The dock also uses the same cable, and you only get one in the box. Although if you're using the dock, you'll probably never need the cable directly into the mouse.My only real complaints that make the thing annoying to use, or where features are lacking, is the software side. As other reviews have said, it uses software called Razer Central to control the custom lights and other configuration options. The lighting UI is actually pretty decent and there are quite a number of customization options. There are some things lacking that I wish it had. For example, you can configure the mouse and dock to pulse from red to green as the mouse charges, to indicate battery life. It's a cool feature. But what I would LOVE is for the dock light to be able to show the current battery status of the mouse while it's in use. I do believe it turns yellow at 20% battery life, though.The biggest issue for me though is the constant updates that it does. I feel like at least once every week or so, I'll turn on my computer and everything lags for a minute or two while Razer Central does yet another update. Then a little later it'll just randomly turn all the lights off and on again, as if Roy Trenneman himself had instructed it.Although I should say that I later paired this mouse with a Razer Cynosa Chroma keyboard, so it's not like this problem stopped me from buying another Razer product. They really should work on their software, though. When it comes time to replace this mouse, if the software has improved by then, I'll consider Razer again.",
          "The mouse works. It's a perfectly fine mouse for gaming that I've experienced minimal issues with in the last 15 months of ownership. I don't play mmo's, so the macros are mostly useless to me, but I've yet to experience any software related issues and can say it has lasted longer than my Logitech mice (plural) have. That said, I need to talk about the dock.The dock is great when it works. At first I had zero issues charging. about 3 months in I started noticing it wasn't charging despite being on the dock. This has grown to be an increasingly common problem to the point where I have to very carefully position the mouse on the dock in just the right way to ensure it's charging. Once you know, it's easy, but it was a pain trying to narrow this down and is a major disappointment for an otherwise wonderful mouse.",
          "i've had this mouse for a little over 6 months and these are my thoughts.The dock+dongle cannot be plugged into a USB Switcher unless its powered externally.The included micro-USB cable is the only cable that fits into the mouse since its keyed with a groove on the sides. Otherwise you have to jam a third-party cable in there and then use ridiculous force to get it out.The software has been a pleasant experience for me. I set the dock to show me the mouse's charge level.The dock's magnets don't help me at all in finding the right place to attach the mouse. I have to fiddle around with it and even after all this time it still takes me a few tries.Tracking has been wonderful -Mouse isn't too light or too heavy and even after hours of use my hand doesn't hurt.Coming from a wired G502, this mouse checked all the boxes for me. It's been good for productivity and gaming.At this price (I paid $120 for mouse+dock) I would definitely buy it again but if it was closer to the G502 I'd probably go with that since the PowerPlay Mat seems like a better charging solution if you have the desk space/aesthetic for it.",
          "Now I haven't used all the top mice, but I did my product research before buying this mouse. It is now 2 years later and I've just bought a second one in addition to this purchase. My first mouse still works great with some minor hiccups (will detail below).In my current setup I now have 2 Baslisk Ultimate mice. The reason being: I now have two mice so when one needs to charge, I have the other sitting ready on the charger. And the best part is, the battery life isn't even a problem at all, it has some fantastic battery life. I go probably 2 weeks on a full charge. That being said, I specifically turned off the RGB lights to achieve this. The RGB lights do cut down on the battery life quite a bit, and I never look at my mouse and I really don't care to have RGB lights, I just really love this mouse (hence why I bought 2).As for the minor hiccups I mentioned earlier, there's really only been one. After some time, my mouse began to have some trouble charging on the dock. I found a forum post online talking about this and they recommended taking a Q-tip and dipping it in isopropyl alcohol and cleaning the charging contacts. I tried it, and it worked. I do have to clean it from time to time, but that is not a problem for me as I value the mouse very highly. I love this mouse because it is 1) wireless and 2) has a charging dock, so I don't have to fuss with plugging in a cable, I just set it down. I also love that 3) the dock can be set to turn specific colors indicating battery life.4) I am given the power of Hypershift which can be very powerful with a mouse. The way I primarily use it is: I set my Hypershift key to the trigger button on the mouse. Hypershift+left is bound to go back a page in my web browser, HS+right is forward a page, HS+left mouse wheel nudge moves me left a tab and HS+right mouse wheel moves me right a tab in the web browser. It makes web browsing such a fluid experience, no reaching for the tiny forward/backward button or wasting time moving your mouse there to begin with.Anyway I could go on and on with the ways this mouse is great. I haven't had any weird problems with it and it's lasted me 2 years and still going strong. I love it so much I bought a second one. I can't recommend it enough. And like I said, I haven't used other mice but there's literally no reason for me to look anywhere else. The only thing I can think of would be that I need to clean the charging dock, but that would probably be the case with anything that has wireless contacts. Heck, my Roomba has contacts that need cleaning (with the exact same method btw). I don't know if it's possible to design around that issue.Seriously I'm just trying to give praise to a product that is so perfect in my eyes it needs no further adjustments. Aside from Razer not selling the cable individually, in fact it doesn't even come with the dock if you buy it separately (BOOOOOO!!!!!) But if you have it plugged into the dock at all times, you'll never break it anyway. I recommend this mouse.",
          "I recently purchased this mouse and overall, I am pleased with its performance and the RGB controls with Razer Synapses are great. However, I did notice a lack of a feature that would enhance the user experience. Specifically, there is currently no way to visually display the battery level on the mouse. The only indication of the battery level is a blinking red light when it is critically low and a color change on the dock while charging. I believe this could be improved by allowing users to set the battery level display on the mouse's side 8 zone RGB strip. This would not only enhance the user experience but also add a unique touch to the design. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase but this small improvement would make it even better.",
          "04/27/20 UPDATE to new mouse.+1 For amazon making the replacement process quick and easy. Made the shipping label and got the new mouse ordered on the night of my initial review.+1 New mouse even though ordered on Thursday, didn't ship till 11pm saturday night and arrived sunday maybe like 1pm? So extremely fast turn-around.+1 This mouse works perfectly fine. Getting used to the size and weight was much faster than I thought.+1 Tested the battery life @ 10% lighting, on a static light blue color, and set the mouse to turn off RGB after 5 minutes of no movement. With off and on usage, and gaming in the mix, I got 4 days of battery life total, 3 comfortably, 4th day I felt like charging it. This was about what I expected and I am very happy with its current battery performance.+1 I have no trouble reaching and using the metal side mouse button with my thumb as my discord PTT. I have smallish hands and its comfortable for me. Not sure how people \"can't\" reach it.? Had some issues with synapse not letting me change my mouse color when not on the dock, so I had to make a new profile and delete the original one, then restart the app. Works fine now, could have been me not being familiar with the software so I didn't knock a star off for that.4 Stars only because of the bad QA on the first mouse.Now that I am putting time into this mouse I am happy with my purchase and for the most part my old PROS/CONS are basically the same.---------------------------------------------------OLD INITIAL REVIEW---------------------------------------------------------Currently given a 1 star because within 15 minutes of testing the mouse produces a High pitched \"wet\" click when clicking the LMB (could be because of the switch or sounded like unadhered glue?). Was there every 2-3 clicks and was a higher tone than the actual click so was really annoying. Plus the fact that I could hear it through my open back headphones made that particular mouse a somewhat bad experience. Also It would make the sound when just slightly wiggling the LMB and not actuating the switch.This was as of 04/16/20, should be getting the replacement on the 18th or 19th and I'll update once I've gotten some serious playtime in COD and BFV.PROS-  - Comfortable, Easy to set-up and Synaps was easy to use too.  - RGB set to 10% for the mouse seems to be peoples go-to for battery life/ visuals.  - QUALITY- Razer always has my respect for giving a high quality feel to their products. Even if their QC fails  them at times like mine.  - Charging dock comes with the sticky rubber base in order to keep it from moving around which is nice.  - Optional side mouse button is metal which is nice, and the switch for it is IMO the best feeling switch I've ever felt. Shame M4 and M5 dont feel like it.CONS-  - Can't use mouse.  - Would like to be able to have custom control over Color-to-Battery Life % on the dock.  - Charging dock gets much hotter than I would have expected, I'll probably drop the brightness on that as  well to see if that cools it down.  - Personal Bias, not a fault of the mouse, I come from using a Rival 300 for a few years, so I'm used to fat heavy mice. Even though its supposed to be about 18% lighter, I don't really feel it.  - Not a fan of the hard plastic they use for the pads, my Rival 300's pads glide much smoother over my new (2 months old) Corsair MM350 XL, the basilisk has a bunch of resistance almost like I can feel it getting caught on individual strands on the mouse mat.  - USB dongle feels very loose in the dock when inserted.  - As far as I could fine you can't set the additional side mouse button to be like a \"M6\" , it can be literally binded to any type of command imaginable. I could probably set it to flush my toilet, but it can't be its own standalone key.",
          "I bought this mouse for its use of optical switches for the left/right mouse click, very high DPI, low latency and Razer's reputation.  Unfortunately, because of buggy software and tracking issues, I had to return my purchase and change my review to 1 star.The mouse was smaller than I expected. For example, when I grab it, there's a 3 inch gap between the back of the mouse, and my palm. Unfortunately, nearly all mice are being made smaller these days. I'm guessing this is due to the average hand size found around the world.  It's too bad no one builds a \"big and tall\" version mouse and keyboard too.  Oh, and this is right hand mouse only (I'm right handed so no issue for me).  I did not rate my review score on size, because my hands are larger than most.The DPI is great, and almost too much for any real application. It's way more than what's needed, but really cool. I'm very impressed by the detail this mouse can crank out.The LED lights are pretty, colorful and the software has a lot of cool customizations. No complaints there.  What would be nice is the special purpose buttons had their own LEDs, which would make finding them easier.The battery life is very poor, especially if you run the lights. I turned off all the lighting features to save power. If you're into mouse disco lights, expect it to work for less than a day. Big difference to my other mouse (which had 1 led) that lasts 2 years on 2 AA batteries! While I understand higher DPI, fast response mice with lots of LEDs take more power, this should be matched with a much larger battery, perhaps 5x the watt hour rating.While the razer claims to have a focusing optical sensor, I found it no better than any other optical sensor mouse. It absolutely will not track on glass (something my laser mouse does just fine on), and despite it's high DPI, is not as accurate as a laser mouse with lower DPI.  Something to consider when buying a higher end mouse.  Finding laser mice these days is difficult, because I think all the mice makers went to the lower cost optical sensors. Too bad, laser mice rock.It's not a Bluetooth mouse. It would be nice if it included this feature. Installing a dongle isn't always practical. Also, no bluetooth means the mouse is useless on mobile devices, such as a tablet computer.The Razer software is buggy, bloated, has UI issues, and requires you to sign in every time you reboot the software or computer. Seriously? do you really want to sign into your mouse software? That is crazy.  If you wish to use very basic functions, such as scroll left / right with scroll wheel, you'll need this software running (unfortunately). Is it spyware? I don't know, and I don't care. If someone wants to spy on my stupid video games, go for it. (hey, I broadcast them anyway). The software was crashing on my Window 10 PC several times a day, requiring going to the task manager, and \"end task\", then restarting the software.  While the mouse will work after the software has crashed, many of the basic features won't (such as the left/right scroll).  Sorry, unstable software affecting basic functionality on a mouse is a deal breaker. Bloatware and needing to \"sign in\" is nearly a deal breaker too.The buttons aren't too bad, but not the best. The special purpose buttons are all in awkward locations, especially the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel. All the buttons feel like a cheap commodity mouse, no precision and very \"clicky\". The scroll wheel could use some improvements, it's just too clunky, doesn't free spin unless you loosen the tensioner on the bottom, then spins too free. The wheel isn't nice, isn't fast, and is a junk. I do like the left/right scroll feature on the mouse wheel. Unfortunately, the Razer software must be running for that feature to work, and the software is unstable.The mouse tracks well, until it doesn't!  This too is a major deal breaker, and in fact after the mouse froze  more than a dozen times a day, typically for 3 to 10 seconds each, I stopped using it. Tracking issues with or without Razer's software, with or without the wired USB, and on multiple mouse pads I tried. Not reliable enough for even doing office work, and you could forget using it for games. Yes, the mouse was close to the wireless receiver at about 1 foot (300 mm). No, there was no other interfering devices. In fact I've never had wireless device issues on this computer in this room before.  I'm guessing the mouse freezing is due to buggy mouse firmware, or a marginal optical sensor (or both).  I've used 5 dollar optical mice that perform fine without tacking issues.

          "I wanted a decent gaming mouse that was a bit better than average, but not crazy expensive. I managed to pick up the mouse and charging dock combo for under $100. First impressions were very good. It's well made, battery seems to get about 20-30ish hours of use before it needs a charge, although I leave it on the dock when it's not in use so it's never an issue. I wanted something a bit larger than average to fit my hands (I wear an XL glove, for reference), and the reviews that made this claim were right on - it's basically the perfect size.Buttons are well placed and feel sturdy, and I love the adjustable wheel resistance to get it just the way you want. This is my first mouse with a thumb rest and I'll never go back. There's plenty of sensitivity there. The only time I feel more than 20,000DPI would be needed is if you're playing on a 85\" 4K monitor at full res, or you're expecting way too much from a upper-mid-range gaming mouse. This one edged out the Logitech G502 for me because of the sale price I was able to get, and the option of the charging dock.My only gripes with the hardware are the power \"stubs\" on the charging dock (takes a few wiggles to get the mouse to sit on it properly), and the micro-USB charging port on the mouse itself (it's molded so it will only take a cable with a proprietary molded pigtail). These aren't huge issues, although if the cable were to ever break, you'd need to buy that specific cable and not just any micro-USB. The dock also uses the same cable, and you only get one in the box. Although if you're using the dock, you'll probably never need the cable directly into the mouse.My only real complaints that make the thing annoying to use, or where features are lacking, is the software side. As other reviews have said, it uses software called Razer Central to control the custom lights and other configuration options. The lighting UI is actually pretty decent and there are quite a number of customization options. There are some things lacking that I wish it had. For example, you can configure the mouse and dock to pulse from red to green as the mouse charges, to indicate battery life. It's a cool feature. But what I would LOVE is for the dock light to be able to show the current battery status of the mouse while it's in use. I do believe it turns yellow at 20% battery life, though.The biggest issue for me though is the constant updates that it does. I feel like at least once every week or so, I'll turn on my computer and everything lags for a minute or two while Razer Central does yet another update. Then a little later it'll just randomly turn all the lights off and on again, as if Roy Trenneman himself had instructed it.Although I should say that I later paired this mouse with a Razer Cynosa Chroma keyboard, so it's not like this problem stopped me from buying another Razer product. They really should work on their software, though. When it comes time to replace this mouse, if the software has improved by then, I'll consider Razer again.",
          "The mouse works. It's a perfectly fine mouse for gaming that I've experienced minimal issues with in the last 15 months of ownership. I don't play mmo's, so the macros are mostly useless to me, but I've yet to experience any software related issues and can say it has lasted longer than my Logitech mice (plural) have. That said, I need to talk about the dock.The dock is great when it works. At first I had zero issues charging. about 3 months in I started noticing it wasn't charging despite being on the dock. This has grown to be an increasingly common problem to the point where I have to very carefully position the mouse on the dock in just the right way to ensure it's charging. Once you know, it's easy, but it was a pain trying to narrow this down and is a major disappointment for an otherwise wonderful mouse.",
          "i've had this mouse for a little over 6 months and these are my thoughts.The dock+dongle cannot be plugged into a USB Switcher unless its powered externally.The included micro-USB cable is the only cable that fits into the mouse since its keyed with a groove on the sides. Otherwise you have to jam a third-party cable in there and then use ridiculous force to get it out.The software has been a pleasant experience for me. I set the dock to show me the mouse's charge level.The dock's magnets don't help me at all in finding the right place to attach the mouse. I have to fiddle around with it and even after all this time it still takes me a few tries.Tracking has been wonderful -Mouse isn't too light or too heavy and even after hours of use my hand doesn't hurt.Coming from a wired G502, this mouse checked all the boxes for me. It's been good for productivity and gaming.At this price (I paid $120 for mouse+dock) I would definitely buy it again but if it was closer to the G502 I'd probably go with that since the PowerPlay Mat seems like a better charging solution if you have the desk space/aesthetic for it.",
          "Now I haven't used all the top mice, but I did my product research before buying this mouse. It is now 2 years later and I've just bought a second one in addition to this purchase. My first mouse still works great with some minor hiccups (will detail below).In my current setup I now have 2 Baslisk Ultimate mice. The reason being: I now have two mice so when one needs to charge, I have the other sitting ready on the charger. And the best part is, the battery life isn't even a problem at all, it has some fantastic battery life. I go probably 2 weeks on a full charge. That being said, I specifically turned off the RGB lights to achieve this. The RGB lights do cut down on the battery life quite a bit, and I never look at my mouse and I really don't care to have RGB lights, I just really love this mouse (hence why I bought 2).As for the minor hiccups I mentioned earlier, there's really only been one. After some time, my mouse began to have some trouble charging on the dock. I found a forum post online talking about this and they recommended taking a Q-tip and dipping it in isopropyl alcohol and cleaning the charging contacts. I tried it, and it worked. I do have to clean it from time to time, but that is not a problem for me as I value the mouse very highly. I love this mouse because it is 1) wireless and 2) has a charging dock, so I don't have to fuss with plugging in a cable, I just set it down. I also love that 3) the dock can be set to turn specific colors indicating battery life.4) I am given the power of Hypershift which can be very powerful with a mouse. The way I primarily use it is: I set my Hypershift key to the trigger button on the mouse. Hypershift+left is bound to go back a page in my web browser, HS+right is forward a page, HS+left mouse wheel nudge moves me left a tab and HS+right mouse wheel moves me right a tab in the web browser. It makes web browsing such a fluid experience, no reaching for the tiny forward/backward button or wasting time moving your mouse there to begin with.Anyway I could go on and on with the ways this mouse is great. I haven't had any weird problems with it and it's lasted me 2 years and still going strong. I love it so much I bought a second one. I can't recommend it enough. And like I said, I haven't used other mice but there's literally no reason for me to look anywhere else. The only thing I can think of would be that I need to clean the charging dock, but that would probably be the case with anything that has wireless contacts. Heck, my Roomba has contacts that need cleaning (with the exact same method btw). I don't know if it's possible to design around that issue.Seriously I'm just trying to give praise to a product that is so perfect in my eyes it needs no further adjustments. Aside from Razer not selling the cable individually, in fact it doesn't even come with the dock if you buy it separately (BOOOOOO!!!!!) But if you have it plugged into the dock at all times, you'll never break it anyway. I recommend this mouse.",
          "I recently purchased this mouse and overall, I am pleased with its performance and the RGB controls with Razer Synapses are great. However, I did notice a lack of a feature that would enhance the user experience. Specifically, there is currently no way to visually display the battery level on the mouse. The only indication of the battery level is a blinking red light when it is critically low and a color change on the dock while charging. I believe this could be improved by allowing users to set the battery level display on the mouse's side 8 zone RGB strip. This would not only enhance the user experience but also add a unique touch to the design. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase but this small improvement would make it even better.",
          "04/27/20 UPDATE to new mouse.+1 For amazon making the replacement process quick and easy. Made the shipping label and got the new mouse ordered on the night of my initial review.+1 New mouse even though ordered on Thursday, didn't ship till 11pm saturday night and arrived sunday maybe like 1pm? So extremely fast turn-around.+1 This mouse works perfectly fine. Getting used to the size and weight was much faster than I thought.+1 Tested the battery life @ 10% lighting, on a static light blue color, and set the mouse to turn off RGB after 5 minutes of no movement. With off and on usage, and gaming in the mix, I got 4 days of battery life total, 3 comfortably, 4th day I felt like charging it. This was about what I expected and I am very happy with its current battery performance.+1 I have no trouble reaching and using the metal side mouse button with my thumb as my discord PTT. I have smallish hands and its comfortable for me. Not sure how people \"can't\" reach it.? Had some issues with synapse not letting me change my mouse color when not on the dock, so I had to make a new profile and delete the original one, then restart the app. Works fine now, could have been me not being familiar with the software so I didn't knock a star off for that.4 Stars only because of the bad QA on the first mouse.Now that I am putting time into this mouse I am happy with my purchase and for the most part my old PROS/CONS are basically the same.---------------------------------------------------OLD INITIAL REVIEW---------------------------------------------------------Currently given a 1 star because within 15 minutes of testing the mouse produces a High pitched \"wet\" click when clicking the LMB (could be because of the switch or sounded like unadhered glue?). Was there every 2-3 clicks and was a higher tone than the actual click so was really annoying. Plus the fact that I could hear it through my open back headphones made that particular mouse a somewhat bad experience. Also It would make the sound when just slightly wiggling the LMB and not actuating the switch.This was as of 04/16/20, should be getting the replacement on the 18th or 19th and I'll update once I've gotten some serious playtime in COD and BFV.PROS-  - Comfortable, Easy to set-up and Synaps was easy to use too.  - RGB set to 10% for the mouse seems to be peoples go-to for battery life/ visuals.  - QUALITY- Razer always has my respect for giving a high quality feel to their products. Even if their QC fails  them at times like mine.  - Charging dock comes with the sticky rubber base in order to keep it from moving around which is nice.  - Optional side mouse button is metal which is nice, and the switch for it is IMO the best feeling switch I've ever felt. Shame M4 and M5 dont feel like it.CONS-  - Can't use mouse.  - Would like to be able to have custom control over Color-to-Battery Life % on the dock.  - Charging dock gets much hotter than I would have expected, I'll probably drop the brightness on that as  well to see if that cools it down.  - Personal Bias, not a fault of the mouse, I come from using a Rival 300 for a few years, so I'm used to fat heavy mice. Even though its supposed to be about 18% lighter, I don't really feel it.  - Not a fan of the hard plastic they use for the pads, my Rival 300's pads glide much smoother over my new (2 months old) Corsair MM350 XL, the basilisk has a bunch of resistance almost like I can feel it getting caught on individual strands on the mouse mat.  - USB dongle feels very loose in the dock when inserted.  - As far as I could fine you can't set the additional side mouse button to be like a \"M6\" , it can be literally binded to any type of command imaginable. I could probably set it to flush my toilet, but it can't be its own standalone key.",
          "I bought this mouse for its use of optical switches for the left/right mouse click, very high DPI, low latency and Razer's reputation.  Unfortunately, because of buggy software and tracking issues, I had to return my purchase and change my review to 1 star.The mouse was smaller than I expected. For example, when I grab it, there's a 3 inch gap between the back of the mouse, and my palm. Unfortunately, nearly all mice are being made smaller these days. I'm guessing this is due to the average hand size found around the world.  It's too bad no one builds a \"big and tall\" version mouse and keyboard too.  Oh, and this is right hand mouse only (I'm right handed so no issue for me).  I did not rate my review score on size, because my hands are larger than most.The DPI is great, and almost too much for any real application. It's way more than what's needed, but really cool. I'm very impressed by the detail this mouse can crank out.The LED lights are pretty, colorful and the software has a lot of cool customizations. No complaints there.  What would be nice is the special purpose buttons had their own LEDs, which would make finding them easier.The battery life is very poor, especially if you run the lights. I turned off all the lighting features to save power. If you're into mouse disco lights, expect it to work for less than a day. Big difference to my other mouse (which had 1 led) that lasts 2 years on 2 AA batteries! While I understand higher DPI, fast response mice with lots of LEDs take more power, this should be matched with a much larger battery, perhaps 5x the watt hour rating.While the razer claims to have a focusing optical sensor, I found it no better than any other optical sensor mouse. It absolutely will not track on glass (something my laser mouse does just fine on), and despite it's high DPI, is not as accurate as a laser mouse with lower DPI.  Something to consider when buying a higher end mouse.  Finding laser mice these days is difficult, because I think all the mice makers went to the lower cost optical sensors. Too bad, laser mice rock.It's not a Bluetooth mouse. It would be nice if it included this feature. Installing a dongle isn't always practical. Also, no bluetooth means the mouse is useless on mobile devices, such as a tablet computer.The Razer software is buggy, bloated, has UI issues, and requires you to sign in every time you reboot the software or computer. Seriously? do you really want to sign into your mouse software? That is crazy.  If you wish to use very basic functions, such as scroll left / right with scroll wheel, you'll need this software running (unfortunately). Is it spyware? I don't know, and I don't care. If someone wants to spy on my stupid video games, go for it. (hey, I broadcast them anyway). The software was crashing on my Window 10 PC several times a day, requiring going to the task manager, and \"end task\", then restarting the software.  While the mouse will work after the software has crashed, many of the basic features won't (such as the left/right scroll).  Sorry, unstable software affecting basic functionality on a mouse is a deal breaker. Bloatware and needing to \"sign in\" is nearly a deal breaker too.The buttons aren't too bad, but not the best. The special purpose buttons are all in awkward locations, especially the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel. All the buttons feel like a cheap commodity mouse, no precision and very \"clicky\". The scroll wheel could use some improvements, it's just too clunky, doesn't free spin unless you loosen the tensioner on the bottom, then spins too free. The wheel isn't nice, isn't fast, and is a junk. I do like the left/right scroll feature on the mouse wheel. Unfortunately, the Razer software must be running for that feature to work, and the software is unstable.The mouse tracks well, until it doesn't!  This too is a major deal breaker, and in fact after the mouse froze  more than a dozen times a day, typically for 3 to 10 seconds each, I stopped using it. Tracking issues with or without Razer's software, with or without the wired USB, and on multiple mouse pads I tried. Not reliable enough for even doing office work, and you could forget using it for games. Yes, the mouse was close to the wireless receiver at about 1 foot (300 mm). No, there was no other interfering devices. In fact I've never had wireless device issues on this computer in this room before.  I'm guessing the mouse freezing is due to buggy mouse firmware, or a marginal optical sensor (or both).  I've used 5 dollar optical mice that perform fine without tacking issues. Sorry, it was a no brainer as to if I should keep the high priced mouse or return it.  In fact even if I couldn't return it, I would still have never used it.  A mouse that freezes is unacceptable.The cable it shipped with is excellent, and allows recharge and use while connected. This cord is very flexible, and probably the best USB wire cord material I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, as I wrote, even when wired, the mouse still had tracking issues.

          "I bought this mouse without really looking at the specs. I've become accustomed to peripherals just working with my MacBook Pro. So I was a little worried when it arrived and there was nothing in the guide that came with it about Mac compatibility. Nevertheless, it does work with Mac in a very basic way. Because the mouse requires a USB dongle to communicate with the laptop, you will need a USB-C to USB adapter. Plug that in, turn on the mouse, and the laptop recognizes it immediately. No driver installation or software installation necessary. You can change the cursor and scroll speed in the mouse settings in the Mac System Preferences. Most games have keybind settings, so you can associate any of the mouse buttons with whatever abilities you want in game. As best I can tell, the only thing drawback to using this device with a Mac is that there is no compatibility with the Razer Synapse or RGB software. Which means you can't customize the lighting effects or create mouse-click macros. This is an expensive mouse, so if you want full functionality, you will want to buy another one that is 100% Mac compatible (and Razer does not make such a device). However, if you are happy paying top dollar for an ergonomic mouse, this will work fine. The buttons are finely tuned and don't require a lot of pressure to click. The scroll wheel or middle-click button works very well. It's a beautiful device that changes color as you use it. You just can't customize the color scheme for particular games, that's all.",
          "I've been using the Logitech G502 ever since I first got into PC gaming about 2 and a half years ago. Ever since, I've been a huge Logitech fanboy. But when the G502 Lightspeed was announced, I was intrigued. Yet, I found the idea of having a cable nearby at all times in order to charge the mouse unintuitive. Additionally, having to plug in the cable would be a hassle. If I truly wanted to go wireless, I would need a $100 mousepad which would charge my mouse wirelessly. Yet, with an extended mousepad, the additional mousepad seemed incommodious since I owuld have had to layer the two. With the mousepad, the total price would have been $250. All for the luxary of going wireless.So when I heard about the Basilisk Ultimate HyperSpeed by Razer, I became interested. I've always had a grudge with Razer mice in the past since the ones I did have were uncomfortable and broke easily (but to be fair, they were cheap and I didn't put utmost care into them.) However, after watching reviews online and looking more into the mouse, I decided to buy it. I have never regret that decision.Transitioning from the G502 to the Basilisk Hyperspeed was a breeze, since they both have a similar form-factor. The features that are included with this mouse are amazing. The charging dock is stylish enough to blend in with the rest of my setup, and only takes up one USB port since the wireless receiver for the mouse can be plugged in to the port directly on the dock, which is already plugged in to your PC. The feet of the mouse are 100% PTFE, meaning that they will glide with ease and will not hold you back when gaming. The scroll sensitivity adjustment located on the bottom of the mouse is also really nice, since you can adjust it to have a very pronounced tactile bump on each step when scrolling or a buttery smooth scroll with no bump whatsoever, and anywhere in between of course. Additionally, as soon as you plug the dock in to your PC, a message will pop up prompting you to download Razer Synapse, so there's no need to go looking online for software.Within Razer Synapse, there are many cool features you can take advantage of. The sensors on the bottom can be fine tuned to detect the liftoff distance between the mouse and the surface it is facing to your liking, both distancing from and towards the surface independently. The lighting on the mouse is also fantastic when using Chroma Studio built in to Synapse, which can let you control each of the 14 LED's individually, or be used in sync with various lighting effects. And don't worry about the lights draining your battery, since you are given the option to have the mouse turn off all lighting after a certain amount of time of idling with no input.The battery life on the mouse is nothing to scoff at. I typically only fully charge my mouse about once every week and a half, and I use my PC for about 6-10 hours daily. Also, this mouse charges quick, and a few minutes of charge and get you nearly an hour of use.There's a lot more to this mouse than meets the eye, and I know I didn't cover everything that this mouse can do. But, despite it's features, this mouse is extremely pricey. But if you're willing to spend a hefty price for a top tier mouse, then I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",
          "It\u2019s an amazing mouse I love what Razer did with this I had the older version for a while and when I swapped to this it was immediately better I don\u2019t have to deal with batteries the mouse works perfectly with the led software from Razer and even matches my keyboard",

          "\u00a0This mouse is a ergonomic beast if you're looking for a one-stop gaming mouse to use across different categories and on top of that for general use.It has some really great feeling buttons on my unit, and i really enjoy the resistance customizable scroll wheel. I tuned mine somewhere in the middle, and it feels butter! It's very easy to customize everything for both gaming and productivity which is why I got it to add to my rotation. I'm knocking off a star though as the overall build quality of this mouse could be better as there's a lot of rattling going on and the mouse feet are a bit scratchy as on one side there is no foot. Overall though it hasn't effected usability much and i really enjoy using this mouse!",
          "This mouse\u2019s battery drains so quickly, but I realized I can turn off the lighting and the battery lasts so much longer. The only frustrating thing is that sometimes the lighting decides to come back on and I have to keep turning it off every now and then.I use this as an office mouse, sinai can\u2019t comment on how good it is for gaming. It seems to be very responsive when I use it.Another thing to consider is very rarely the mouse actually gets frozen on the screen and won\u2019t move. I\u2019ve found turning the mouse off and back on again fixes this.Overall I am happy with my purchase. It is very comfortable to use, the scrolling wheel is great, the ability to do continuous scroll in either direction is great.",
          "I am a LONG time user of Logitech mice and finally got tired with the change in quality, they seems to last about a year or two now.So my wife had tried this mouse and said she liked it. So, I tried one, then bough a second. (I have two computers on my desk - one Mac the other Windows.So far, I like the mouse. I think the buttons on the top to change DPI are redundant, it could be done in an app, since I don't do it often.The HIGH resolution is kind of a marketing gimmic, since if you set the resolution to max, then it moves very slowly and at low resolution it moves very fast. Mouse tracking speed I would always set via mouse control panel. But, anyway. the point is you pick the speed you want to track the mouse by changing the resolution. Or you can se the resolution to max and then adjust tracking speed in the mouse control panel.each to their own.I also got the charger, I find it very convienent, every day when I leave my desk I simply put the mouse on the charger and it will never need to be charged or batteries replaced.So, over all, I am very happy with the mouse. Now if it will last more than a year I will come back and update this. If not, then I will go back to the less expensive Logitech.",
          "This is a great mouse, but with one weakness: the scroll wheel.I have bought this mouse twice because I had to return the first one.  The first one I returned because the scroll wheel was intermittently responsive.  The second one (which I currently own), initially the wheel worked perfectly, but over time, it would also become intermittently responsive.  I believe the reason is its feature to adjust wheel resistance.  I suspect that mechanism introduces some unreliability with the wheel.Other flaws1)  The scroll wheel left and right tilt, by default, do not scroll left and right.  You need Razer synapse software to reprogram this.  This is incredibly odd.  So if you can't install Synapse (i.e. a work laptop), you won't be able to scroll left and right.2) You can only recharge the mouse with the micro USB cable that it came with.  Reason: The charging port has an oddly specific shape that makes other micro USB cables you already own not work.Pros: Great RGB, very slippery feet, very ergonomic, very responsive.Conclusion: I have two Razer Basilisk Hyperspeed X, one for office and one for game.  I rate the X 5 out of 5. These are inexpensive versions of the Ultimate and have none of the flaws I mentioned.  If RGB is not important, I say get the Hyperspeed X. Only if RGB is important, consider the Ultimate.",
          "I was skeptical about paying 80$ for a mouse a friend strongly recommended razer products to me after I had several bad experiences with red dragon products ( most are over priced for the products performance )  then I came across the basilisk ultimate that advertised up to 100 hour battery life it's legit... I work at home on the computer and I game on the computer most of the time I' charged it as soon as I got it and then 6 days later I'm at 11% i charged it again it's been 3 days since my last charge still running strong very nice feel to it and I like the  download able software there's alot of things you can do with it . I also like they let you program all the buttons to your pleasing something red dragon cannot do... super happy with this purchase i would have paid 100$ for the mouse and still be happy .. they say it should last for 70 million clicks and the products with razer come with standerd 1 year warranty too.. I'm definitely looking forward to buying more gear from razer... unfortunately my keyboard my keyboard stopped working today so that might be happening soon love  your products razor !",
          "Operates as expected. Smooth movement and tons of features",
          "I ordered this mouse in as it was the same design as the G502 that I very much enjoyed, but I wanted to keep my peripherals matched with my other Razer products, as well as my recent experience with the \"updated\" Logitech G Hub app was VERY frustrating and not enjoyable. I use this both for work and play at home for many games.The design itself is great and feels very nice to use with my preferred fingertip/claw grip. The biggest complaints about the mouse fall into this field for me though as I very much miss the 2 buttons on the left mouse button that are present in the G502, but are missing in this rendition, however this is not to be faulted against Razer as that is a different mouse, just something I'd love to see. The other complaint is the removable thumb paddle which is very short and difficult to reach without readjusting your grip. The last minor complaint is that the underside compartment where the USB dongle can be stored is a very cheap plastic door that I can see breaking or becoming lost after extended use. It would have been nice to see a more stable hinged or sliding door to house the USB when traveling. Aside from that, the buttons feel responsive and pleasant, and the scroll wheel resistance settings are much more preferred rather than just tactile or free spin. The mouse feels light and sturdy enough that I don't ever find myself thinking it feels cheap, and the grip texture along the sides of the mouse is comfortable and doesn't appear to be wearing off so far.As for the functionality of the mouse, the connection speed and response time is incredible! The mouse reacts as fast as a wired mouse with no hiccups that I've encountered so far. The 20k DPI is ridiculous to say the least and I could never see it being used by myself, but it's fun to see the point scream across my monitors at a mere jostle of the mouse. The battery life of my mouse when I first received it was dismal at best and I was very disappointed to see the battery life drop from ~90% to ~60% after sitting on my desk TURNED OFF for a few hours. I charged to full a few times and was still encountering the issue, so I reached out to Razer Support. They provided me a firmware update file, something that I thought the Synapse app would have done, and after following the instructions to update the mouse, it has been night and day difference! Now my mouse lasts MUCH longer even when left on, with a sleep timer set, while having the RGB brightness set to 30%. Between going from work to home, I use this thing for upwards of 12hrs a day and I can last about 3-4 days before needing to charge.Overall, I very much enjoy this mouse after the Firmware Update was applied and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the feel/style of the Logitech G502, but want to try out something different. I would love to compare the wireless G502 to this one, but I don't have the pocket money to do that. So take this review as simply a review of the mouse and G502 \"fashion\" comparison.",
          "Well, it's a G502 clone produced by Razer that can also go wireless. Better RGB though so it ties my setup pretty well together, but struggles with battery life, it's only good for maybe a few days before needing a recharge.Pros:- RGB profiling is saved to on-board memory, you won't need to change it every time it is plugged into a new PC.- Solid feel in the hand, especially for bigger hands.- Nice quality cable.- No double-clicking issues so far, about a year of daily use.Cons:- Charges using Micro-USB, blech. Not even USB-C?- Very poor battery life even with RGB off, maybe could get 2-3 days out of it before you need a recharge. 1-2 days with RGB.- Wacky implementation of the \"Hypershift\" button which can easily be knocked off during use. V3 version fixes this.- Build quality feels somehow inferior to the G502.Overall, if you are going to be mostly wired, this is not a bad option. But if you can wait a bit, save up the cash for a wireless G502, or a Lightspeed. The Glorious Model-O is another option but is only wired IIRC.",
          "Great mouse, don't use it for gaming as I use a controller but it works perfect so far.",
          "I bought this \"like new\" and it was not like new, it was very/good. The right click button was loose, which from what I read is probably not the fault of the first user i.e. even new Basilisks reportedly sometimes have loose mouse buttons. Sure enough, I bought a new one for only $20 more than this used one, and it had a loose mouse button, so I am returning it. The side buttons also felt loose. The QA of these mice is questionable, but it is indeed the most ergonomic gaming mouse I've used. It fits my palm in the way I've been looking for but haven't been able to find in any other mouse. Everyone's hands are different so your experience may differ.",
          "The mouse looks great! We have a lot of products from Razer in our home and this one did not disappoint. If you can find the option that includes the dock, I say go for that one, it really helps with battery life. The mouse is ergonomic and while I don't use it for work, its great for gaming. I leave it docked when not in use and the battery definitely lasts several hours for FPS and MMO gaming sessions.",
          "My old, trusted mouse began acting rather strangely. It would double click upon most, but not all, single clicks. I ignored this for a few weeks despite it being annoying. Then, a few days ago, the middle mouse button completely stopped working.I hadn't realized how dependent I was on middle-clicking stuff! A link I wanted to read? Middle-click so it opens in a new tab. Realize I wanted to see the last page again but not lose my current page? Middle-click on the back button to open that in a new tab. Decide to open a bookmarked page but don\u2019t want to lose the current page? I\u2019d middle-click on the bookmark to open that in a new tab.Realizing that I simply couldn\u2019t live like a savage any longer, I bought this new mouse and wow, what a huge improvement over a non-functional one. If you ever want to appreciate a product, use a broken piece of crap version for a few weeks. Let it slowly claw at your sanity for as long as you can manage. When you start gibbering and hallucinating, you\u2019re almost there. Continue to ignore it as the madness escalates into an attack on your core identity. Allow it to worm its way into your mind as it starts to make you doubt yourself on multiple levels. Let it get so bad that you start to dread the things you once loved.When the shadows that only you can see begin to whisper dark things and you actually start to think things like, \"Yes, the shadows make a good point. Why haven't I begun to plan a series of perfect murders yet?\" At that point, you are ready to replace the no doubt cursed item with a brand new version.The difference is amazing. The shadows not only recede, but the voices stop. You soon regain your sense of self and realize that you were not your mouse nor was your mouse you; no, you are a separate entity and you deserve to love yourself enough to rid not only yourself, but the world, of the cursed item that had been eroding your sanity.I feel like our prisons would have way less murderers if more people divested themselves of their cursed items and bought new ones sooner. Think not only of yourself, but the safety of your neighbors. Buy this mouse.",

          "\u00a0This mouse feels great, its responsive, accurate and has that RGB flare. I've gone through a few mouses over a year and a half and this one by far feels the best. My previous mouse was a Redragon m801 sniper pro and I thought that was good at the time, but when I switched to the Basilisk Ultimate the sensor felt almost weirdly responsive in a good way. This is my first Razer product and the presentation is spot on. Once I dialed in my dpi lighting and binding, I was off to play Apex legends.Starting with the ergonomics, it feels great after a couple weeks of adjustment. My ring and pinky felt most of the discomfort at the time since the previous mouse was so wide, but after the first two weeks i feel no discomfort with this mouse. The plastic body is very smooth, almost slippery at the top (Solve that with mouse grips). The optional paddle is nice and has a satisfying click. Speaking of clicking, what I'm used to is a solid click from the mouse 1 and 2, this one is a little soft than most mice I've used, but it's less loud too. The scroll wheel has some cool features with tilt and resistance adjustment. I also appreciate the preinstalled side grips, they work for me. My hand measurements are: 3 3/4in from thumb across and 7 1/2in from the middle and ring to my wrist.Battery Life is great, you can make it through a whole day no problem with the RGB on. I usually have it at 50% brightness so your millage may vary. Its a shame though that its NOT USB-C and still uses Micro B for the cable. The cable on the other hand is very light and you could use the mouse with cable without even noticing. It has a compartment for the wireless receiver and connection is flawless. No Bluetooth thought.The Lighting is another luxury of this mouse that Razer proves well. Some game have implemented lighting with the software, for example: Anything you interact with in Apex Legends gets a colored response on the mouse (The video showcases taking damage and a Phoenix Kit being used). The customization is expansive with the Razer software, you can change multiple areas of the mouse individually with effects. The only problem is without the software, the mouse saves everything but the lighting profile.Last, the build quality is mostly plastic. It's smooth and minimal and has appealing curves. The feet glide smoothly and has that premium material.Overall, it's one of the best in wireless mice out there with a premium price tag. Great if you can get it on sale. Would like to see a new version with USB-C thought. :/",
          "One star removed because model without charger station is really only good if always wired.  Had I purchased with charger would say 5/5.  Plugging in the cable seemed like a good idea but in practice was a hassle unless you want to use this as wired-only.  With a charger it works great -- I leave it on the charger over night a couple times a week and it rarely goes below 50% charge.Have only used for 4 months but that has already out-lasted prior mouse.  Was a bit nervous about modest number of buttons but *really* wanted the thumb rest have not been disappointed.Since I already had synapse on my razer laptop using the razer mouse means one less piece of bloat-ware for button programming.",
          "Pretty much no complaints except a few. They're very manipulative with their pricing. I got mine on a \"sale\" and it's $40 more than the price a month or so later. Oh, so it's originally $179.99 and you sell it for $139.99 but a month later it's $99.99. This is a $100 mouse.1) The middle mouse button makes a mechanical clicking noise every time you use it. Sounds uncomfortable and prevents the mouse from being silent.2) I wish the battery lasted 50%+ longer. The battery level isn't bad, still lasts a whole day, but it just seems to drain a bit too fast. Tried fiddling a bit with settings to make it last longer, but maybe I didn't do it right. Either way if it could just last like two days it'd be perfect. Sometimes it doesn't properly connect to the dock (suggest lightly pushing down until you see it charging) and you're stuck with a dead mouse in the morning. Not a fan having to charge it every single day either. Feel like it'll die sooner because of it. Turning the lights down to minimum does help a ton, but it still could be a better.3) The dock doesn't dock well. It's hard to get it to charge and it can come loose. It will even look like it's charging but won't... and if you move it to check it'll probably undock. There's been multiple times I thought it was charging and the next morning it was on red. Luckily it does charge fast... but I don't want to have to continually dock my mouse and undock it while using it to gain 2% increments. I also don't want to use my cheap plugged in mouse when I bought a $130+ mouse (which was overinflated) that has my custom DPI.",
          "I have been a die-hard Razer fan since first purchasing the old Naga Epic in 2010 (before chroma was even a thing, the one with the three interchangeable right sides) and the 2009 Razer Megalodon. Both of these peripherals work great to this day. I replaced my old Naga Epic with the new Chroma in 2017, and in only 3 years found myself needing a replacement because that mouse was not build to as high a standard as my first Naga and was already acting up for over a year. I hate to say it but the Basilisk wasn't my first choice, I actually bought the Corsair Nightsword but returned it because I didn't like the hand feel.Backstory aside, I ended u; buying this mouse, because I wanted to believe buying the best from Razer would still give me the best mouse. And honestly, I believe that still seems to be the case. This mouse feels a lot more premium built than the standard Naga that I've used recently. The aerodynamics of the mouse are very nice and easy to transition to if you are coming from a different style mouse, the optional thumb paddle is perfectly position to be pretty much a third click (great for a keyboard button that's often used in any game, or a macro). Razer Synapse 3 is probably the best gaming software I've used, and this mouse has world of chroma and performance customization, which is a big plus too. And the charging dock is a cool way to recharge your mouse and have it be a gaming fashion piece on your desk, which in my opinion looks very nice when showing off your gaming setup. I love having absolutely zero wire drag, and I haven't experience any noticeable latency with it being wireless, which I know may be a concern for some. I have pretty much only positive things to say about this mouse.That being said, I simply cannot give this mouse a 5 star. Why you may ask? Because I am not a fan of trick marketing, which Razer is still at fault of doing. The mouse will not get you 100 hours of gaming, because I've never been able to get 100 hours out of a single charge. I know they say \"up to\", but even on really low visual settings, I could crank out 50 hours, at best. now, 50 usable hours is still great, but with the rgb turned on and using it on normal gaming, I find myself needing to charge it overnight every 3-4 days, if I game 8 hours in the day (so lets say, 25-30 hours of use time between charges). That definitely isn't bad in the world of gaming and batteries, but I would have appreciated these real world numbers reflected in the advertising.All in all, it is a solid feeling, premium looking and performing mouse that demands a premium to be paid, but it  has brought back that trust that Razer is just that good of a gaming company. I still use my first Naga at my work office, and I hope that this Basilisk Ultimate joins the club over the course of this decade.",

          "\u00a0Hello all. Here to drop a review for the Razer Basilisk Ultimate w/ Charging Dock. This baby was a pretty penny, so I\u2019ll run you through some of the features, pros and cons, to see if it lives up to the hefty price tag.Form factor is great. I\u2019m coming from a g502 with pretty big hands, and this mouse feels like an old friend. Construction is very nice and feels like a solid, durable mouse despite being noticeably lighter than its g502 counterpart. I swapped on the plastic flipper for the side clutch button and that feels remarkably more comfortable to reach than the g502\u2019s clutch. The adjustable scroll wheel is phenomenal and feels great at both tight and loose resistances, though it lacks the g502\u2019s infinite scroll.RGB is awesome. This mouse is a looker, and you can check out in my video what I was able to do with just some minor tinkering in Razer Chroma Studio. The software lets you customize lighting for both the mouse and the charging dock, and it\u2019s very intuitive and comes packed with impressive lighting options. I personally found the RGB on the mouse looks better to me on lower brightness (I felt it looked more \u201cdefined\u201d and less blurry, especially around the logo). That\u2019s perfect because it helps me conserve battery.The battery life was a little concerning, specifically the time to charge. Then someone recommended I update the firmware, which Razer Synapse (the Razer product management suite) does not do automatically. DO THIS. Battery life and charging time have both noticeably improved.The sensor and response are what you would expect from an almost $200 mouse. Smooth in games, easy to adjust dpi, and clicks are responsive.That said, I have had some hiccups. They would be forgettable, except that I paid a premium price for the mouse and that makes the hiccups a lot less endearing. Once in a while, the mouse seems to forget where it is. Over the course of the weekend this has happened two times, and really it just freezes for a second or two. That isn\u2019t all it forgets. It may be caused by me remapping there clutch to another keybinding, but the clutch button stopped working completely and had to be powered off and on to fix it. It also forgot my custom keybinding for middle mouse click and I had to input it again to fix it.I suspect these problems are less related to the mouse and more related to Razer Synapse. While the program doesn\u2019t feel buggy to use, it does seem to be the culprit of these \u201ccute quirks\u201d. Additionally, it caused the game Overwatch to close itself on launch until I removed the \u201cVisualizer\u201d app in Synapse. Not as \u201ccute\u201d. Synapse is why I can\u2019t give the mouse 5 stars. I hope they work out the kinks.Overall, the Basilisk Ultimate has still earned a recommendation as well as its hefty cost. I\u2019d definitely recommend it over the g502, with or without the charging dock; but man that dock is convenient (and pretty too). Get it!",
          "Seriously. We all know software for products can be annoying at times, and razer can be as well, but if you really take your time to get to know the software, it rocks! After 38 years of using mice, this is by far, the best mouse I have ever used in every way. I have the headphones as well, all these guys products are built very well. I can not complain about one single thing. Absolutely the best mouse I have ever used. I'm sure there may, and I stress may, be better, but this one is the winner for me 100%. I want another one for my other gaming PC and will be getting it as soon as possible. Thank you razer for another awesome product, you made my week!",
          "I use the original G502 before hero came out for years then moved to the M65 which I loved.Now I have a NEW wireless set up using the G915 keyboard, I\u2019ve been searching for the best WIRELESS gaming mouse for myself. I BOUGHT and RETURNED: G703, G902, G PRO, G502 LS, Dark Core, Razer mamba & viper. I was going to stick with the viper even thro it was too small for my larger right hand. Until I seen the Basilisk Ultimate release. Returned the Viper tried out the Basilisk and now my new wireless set up is completed. This is a true G502 killer, if you bought the G502LS well return it and buy this. The thumb paddle is better to press than the G502 and the Basilisk PTFE feet glides so smooth/feels better in my hand and RBS is amazing compeer to all wireless mouse and to top that off it weighs less with no double click issues and a RBG charging dockI really like the IDEA of the thumb \u201cClutch/Paddle\u201d button but I do wish the piece was longer.I would of taking less battery power option if they could have got this down to 99g or less.Customizable Scroll Wheel Resistance is a fantastic idea to compete with Logitech free wheel.Every company should now be using PTFE feet glides. Good job Razer.Razer Synapse 3 works well for me no issues with software. Macros/KeybindsWifi 2.4 Hyperspeed Wireless is amazing NO LAG what\u2019s so everI mostly use the NVIDIA SHEILD TV and play OVERWATCH or when I work from home/laptop.Since I use the Nvidia Shield to play Overwatch I need to map the mouse side buttons to a number/letter to make it work in game on the Shield. This works well and macros too. I have to save all settings to the ON BOARD MEMORY. I wish I had more than 5 profiles but I am happy that I have 5 and not just 1-3I am very DISSAPOINTED that no RBG lighting settings SAVE to OnBoard memory. Even a few simple options to be saved would have been grateful. Oh-well\u2026Basilisk ProsHyperspeed Wireless \u2013 ZERO LAG and 100% amazingThe RGB charging DOCK is simply PERFECT, what a great feature.PTFE glides mouse feet are the best.

I have dropped mouse on floor few times with no issues still working fantastic. The software could be designed better but it is what it is.",
          "This mouse left a horrible first impression since it could not have bothered anyone to clean this before it arrived in my hands. I purchased this in very good condition from Amazon Warehouse. I would not be one to complain about a used product being like this but the fact that I payed $125 from Amazon I would expect this mouse to at least be clean. The mouse' onboard memory was evidently not cleared as the previous owners profiles were saved to the mouse. Had to factory reset this mouse. Disappointed in these aspects.MOUSE REVIEW:As anyone would expect this mouse is modeled after the G502 and that is not a bad thing. The ergonomic feel is great and anyone that has hailed to the G502 will give this mouse the same praise.The weight of the mouse is what would be considered \"mid-sized\". Weighing in at 107 grams and being wireless with this many features I was not be disappointed. I personally played on a deathadder elite prior to this mouse. It is only 2 grams lighter being a wired mouse. This weight shouldn't bother most people unless you are an avid FPS gamer.I also purchased this mouse for productivity. I am a Graduate student in Computer Science to give you an idea about my workflow. The scroll wheel feels great to scroll through documents and code at the lowest sensitivity. Super quite when you need it to be and super ratcheted if you need the feedback. The only complaint here is that there is no hyperscroll like on the G502.The lighting and battery life on this mouse has treated me well thus far. The mouse has always outlasted me in gaming sessions and plunking it onto the charging dock afterwards makes battery life a non issue. The lighting is pretty bright but it does suck out battery life quickly. The longest session I had on this mouse is 8 hours with 50% brightness with juice still left.For gaming this is a great mouse, the optomechanical switches feel and sound great. Fastest in the market technically as well. The sensor is good but disappoints me since there is only 1000Hz polling rate. A higher polling rate would be appreciated.TLDRFirst impression sucked given animal and human hair was taped or stuck to this product.Overall this mouse is great. Well worth the money imo for gaming and is only missing infinite scrolling for productivity. Get it with the dock if possible so you never have to worry about charging it. (The dock alone is $50, purchase it with the mouse.) Razer did a great job with this mouse.",
          "I love this mouse. Not anything bad to say. I purchased some grips that are on the line of sandpaper and helps alot",
          "My first flagship mouse was the razer mamba, which had a peeling rubber grip (likely due to arizona heat and not necessarily razer's fault, glue was actually peeling from my Chevy Sonic too) and eventually double click issues from mechanical switches after about a year of use.  Switched to a g703 which was a fantastic mouse, no rubber grips to peel, but developed double clicks after about 6 months of use.  I have decided I was sick of mechanical switches and went for optical.  Razer is the only reliable optical switch on the market so far.  So I got a viper, which is a fantastic fingertip grip mouse when I'm gaming, but it cannot palm grip.  I'm more of an artist and editor than a gamer, so I needed a reliable mouse that can palm grip, my long fingers on the super thin viper was making my wrist hurt.If you're trying to decide between the viper and the basilisk there's a few things to keep in mind.The basilisk seems to have newer optical switches than the viper.  I ended up with a gen 1 viper and gen 2 vipers cannot be guaranteed, even from razer, let alone a refurbisher that deals with a lot of returns.  It's actually why I bought this mouse from razer this time instead of a refurbisher, but there doesn't seem to be any complains online about spongey clicks with this mouse like there were about the viper.  The basilisk does have an issue with wobbly clickers, didn't happen on my model, this is a defect that is replaceable unlike the gen 1 switch issue if it does happen.Despite the look of the basilisk, gamers will probably prefer the viper.  The viper is not comfortable to me.  And I think it's because all my life, even if it was a cheap office mouse, I've been using ergonomic mice.  This mouse is heavy.  It can be fingertip gripped but if you can fingertip and you play fps you would prefer the viper.  I might not return my viper because I actually do like how lightweight it is for games, but I definitely prefer the ergonomics on the basilisk.  I cannot palm grip my viper.I prefer the basilisk, fingertip and claw grippers probably won't.  I'm a special case,  I cannot palm the viper",
          "I'm pretty sure that my physical device is defective, but the issues didn't really become clear until after the return period had passed. This mouse has an adjustable tensioner for the scroll which is great. Unfortunately for me, mine is problematic. Regardless of how tight or loose the tension I set, moving the mouse while gaming will cause the sensor for the scroll wheel to recognize and I am OFTEN changing weapons at the absolute worst times. Even by setting the tensioner at the highest level, I am still seeing regular scrolls being detected and causing weapon changes. I confirmed the issue is the scroll wheel by doing a test of thumb + 1 finger on the left and right side, no where near the scroll wheel, and moving the mouse around with occasionally picking it up a few inches to adjust as would occur in a game. Placing the mouse down softly caused the sensor to detect a scroll and the webpage I was on would scroll. Aside from this, the mouse is really good. The battery works well, though to get anywhere close to the 100 hours claimed you have to completely disable the LEDs, which really defeats the purpose of buying a nicer mouse. Even with the light level set to the lowest level, I saw 60-65 hour battery life, which was very unexpected it was that much of a hit for a minimal light level and no changing of the colors. If not for the scroll wheel hardware fault, I'd rate this between 4 and 4.5 stars. But with the physical unit I have, 3 stars is the best I can do.",
          "I compared this mouse to the Steelseries Rival 3, Viper mini, Logitech G Pro, Logitech G502, Logitech G502 Lightspeed.This mouse wins for comfort and stability/precision for value. It's not the best looking, it's not the lightest, but it works the best for what you pay. Especially when you compare it to the newer V3 pro, which is $160 retail. Also, the cable is very good, one of the best I've ever used, so I keep it plugged in a lot of the time.Why I chose this mouse:1) Ergonomic fit. The thumb rest on the left side makes using this mouse so much better for both gaming and regular use. it's a must have.2) Weight. It's a nice Goldilocks option, at 107g. Lighter than the Logitech G502 (120 g), not as light as the Viper mini (61g) , Steelseries Rival 3 (77g) , Logitech G Pro (80g). Personally, I don't like ultralight mice because they don't feel stable. I like stability/precision for FPS, which the Basilisk Ultimate is the best for IMO.",
          "I've been using this mouse for quite some time now, and I have to say that it never lets me down even once. Let's first talk about latency and wireless signal strength since that's most likely the concern for many folks when considering to migrate to wireless peripherals: they are as good as wired. I used to use Predator Cestus 500 (1,000 Hz polling), and I feel no difference in terms of latency or performance comparing the two. If you are still doubtful, I recommend watching LTT video where they teamed up with Slow-Mo Guys comparing the latency of wireless vs wired gaming mouse using high framerate camera. Keep in mind that I am also using WiFi for my PC as well as phone sitting next to it with Bluetooth connected to my PC. I've never had any weird interference due to multiple signal frequencies at all.Next, battery life. I am the type of person who spends a lot of time on PC, and COVID just extends my PC daily usage time by a significant margin. It's safe to say that I am using PC for 10 hours minimum and can be even longer. About a week ago, I tested of fully charging my mouse, and using it continuously without charging it ever. The result was amazing. I had two days of intensive use with about 30% battery juice left (5 minute RGB light timeout; 50% RGB brightness). Theoretically, if I were to be 'eco', that 30% juice should last for another 24 hours if things come to shove.Finally, the software. If you already have Razer peripherals (e.g. Keyboard, RGB hub, headphone, etc) that are controlled via the software, then there is zero concern at all for you. If this would be your first product and you are not planning on getting other Razer peripherals, then it would mean ONE ACTIVELY RUNNING software in the background. The software is necessary for initial setup as well as many other functionalities (e.g. lighting control, special programmed macro buttons, hypershift button, etc). You can theoretically get away by installing and uninstalling the software once you fully program the mouse thanks to onboard memory chip, however, you will not be able to control the lighting, launch programs or control lighting via mouse button, and a lot more. You will feel like you're missing a lot for $100 mouse."

          "Overall, I love typing and playing games on this keyboard, it gets the job done! If you\u2019re a casual gamer this will be good enough and is satisfying to type and do homework with. Only thing you will notice is the back space feels cheap and is by far the loudest key for some weird reason.For enthusiasts, the space bar isn\u2019t the greatest, it\u2019s just average. A little rattle, but had a nice, firm press that you can actually feel when actuate. Bunny hopping in FPS games is no problem. With the RGB, it\u2019s fairly weak, and you expect more for paying for something over $100. The razor software is on the lower tier of RGB software and is he brightness is dim compared to even $50 keyboards. Not a big issue for me, so I won\u2019t knock it too much. The silent keys aren\u2019t silent, but they give off enough sound to feel satisfying and the feedback is OUTSTANDING! When you press a key, you can feel the switch, it\u2019s hard to explain but it gives enough feedback so you know when the key is pressed it feels \u201cheavy\u201d then light again after actuation. After little time it becomes subconscious feedback that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re using, it\u2019s great, by far the best keyboard I had for gaming and schoolwork. I\u2019m a coder so it\u2019s nice having the not so noises keys and satisfying feel. It\u2019s really hard to explain in a description, but if you\u2019re worried on how the yellow switches feel, don\u2019t be. Other than that everything else is solid, nothing fantastic. Keyboard has some bend, volume controls wheel is nice (kind of don\u2019t like the location tho would still prefer the function key) and the software is good enough for shortcuts. I also like how you can disable the windows key while gaming, little nice feature. Arm rest is okay, I have an L shaped desk so the middle kinda floats and I still don\u2019t have slipping issues like others were saying. It doesn\u2019t help that much, it\u2019s just nicer to feel than the desk and having your wrists elevated is more important imo. Overall very solid, would give 5 stars if it went above and beyond. However, the keys are above and beyond and that\u2019s what matters most",
          "This is my 3rd Razer mechanical keyboard. I had the original black widow and also have the v3 clicky at home. I bought this one for work since clicky keys would be too loud.The first thing I noticed with the yellow switches was just how sensitive they are to pressure. The clicky keys take some force to push down and that is a good and bad thing depending on your preference. My major problem was I tend to rest my fingers on the keys at work. This would cause random keys to be pressed. The solution is to just not rest your fingers. It took some getting used to but about a week in I saw less accidentally key activation. I think the yellow keys make you type faster but I still like my green keyboard since I know when the key is pressed.Adding to this point, I think razer should make a \"brown\" tactile but silent version of the black widow. I think the only one they offer is the compact version without the number and rest pads. I don't understand why they can't add that option to the full keyboard since they obviously designed and have the key in stock.If you are wondering how loud the keys are, that depends on how hard you hit the keys. I tend to push all the way down so even the yellow silent keys make some noise. But since they are linear, you can press halfway and they key will still activate.The razer mechanical keyboards are definitely the best imo. I've looked around but razer seems to be the only one that has the custom built wrist pad. I also like the scroll wheel and the build quality. A lot of the other mechanical keyboards have name brand cherry MX switches but then cheap out on the outer material or add weird stuff like a USB passthrough???",
          "I got the yellow switches which are apparently quieter than the green ones. There is still a soothing clickety-clack noise. Overall, the key board just feels good. It is genuinely a joy typing on it. I am told there are more affordable mechanical gaming keyboards that are of comparable quality. That may be so, but I have no regrets getting this amazing product.",
          "Overall, it's a solid keyboard but honestly, after close to two years of use, this keyboard feels like a bit of a downgrade compared to the BlackWidow V2 that I owned previously.I find myself missing the macro keys, which are now absent from the V3, when having to perform keyboard Twister to activate some of the more complicated shortcuts repeatedly.They also removed the USB ports which were so useful for plugging in my mouse and/or gamepad, or any other temporary usb device.Finally, whoever designed the volume control cylinder deserves to be fired for turning something that I didn't even think about with the previous version of the BlackWidow into an awkward nightmare.  It's just so badly placed that it forces you to tread carefully or risk hitting the keys on the numpad.  The wheel itself is works fine and its texture feels nice.  However, it's runined because you really can't roll it seamlessly since it's located way too close to the numpad keys that you have to reach over and will rub against your fingers as you use it.  And you have to press it in to activate mute/unmute, which is awkward because your fingers will keep turning the cylinder instead of you're not extra careful.  I find myself avoiding using what could have been easily resolved with a dedicated mute button.All in all, when a key on my V2 stopped functioning, I wish I would have looked into repairing it or ordering another one of the same model instead of treating myself to this newer V3 model.  It's feels and sounds nice like the V2, but its utility is hampered by some odd design choices that make it feel more like a downgrade without upside.",
          "I love the feel and click I get from this keyboard, I highly dislike the wrist rest it comes with. I upgraded from an Ornata V2 with the wrist rest, and though the wear and tear on it got pretty bad I highly liked the padded wrist rest. The wrist rest for this makes my wrist really sweaty and irritated, I wish they would've put back the padding as it was much more comfortable and gave a lift that aligned my wrist to the keyboard",
          "I bought this for my grandson for his birthday. hes a very serious gammer and he loves his keyboard. it is easy to use and fun. we recomend it for everyone. Its worth the money.",
          "Love it! I bought it with yellow switches and may exchange it for the green since Im use to Tactile (brown) switches. But time will tell. The yellow may grow on me. I dont miss that loud clicky sound as a type at all. The green would return that sound. Yellow is best for FPS gamers btw",
          "dont really have any complaints other than the palm pad is solid vs padded other than that was a great buy",
          "Typing this from this keyboard as we speak. It's sturdy, clicky, and colorful. The keys are nice and sensitive so you don't need to pound the keyboard to get it to work. Amazing, will buy again",
          "It's not as well made as my old 2016 special edition razer keyboard. This one is much lighter and seems less structurally sound.  After some use thought it has out preformed my old keyboard and held up well to hours of gaming and work . I would buy again.",

          "This one is really beautiful. I have to say a bit loud when typing but I believe that like is mechanical then you can change the switches latter :). What I did not like and still do not like is the fact that the keyboard loses the configuration of lights a lot. You have to  restart the synapse at least 3 times at day. I work remotely so I use it to work too but when I go to eat or take a lot of time it just loses the configuration so this is something I consider they have to improve knowing that this one is not cheap. I mean I restart the program and then everything comes again back and works great for a long time but then it just stops working. I don't know if it is something I am not configuration in the synapse but I do not think this has any kind of timer... therefore 4/5 but still a pretty cute one specially because of the synapse.",

It's hard and the cheaper razor keyboard I had came with a soft padded one however the keys weren't as nice or the color.  I love razor products but considering how much I spent I would think razor would have made the support padded not hard.  The keyboard itself is better than I expected.  I only bought this one so I could give my old one to my son who wanted my original one.",

          "I usually don't care much about wrist wrests. They're the least important part of a new keyboard for me and usually end up in the closet unused. But when the one I get is so clearly NOT what is described in the product listing, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. This is NOT leatherette, it's hard plastic. It's also not magnetic, I've confirmed this with strong magnets that hold on to this about as well as any other non-magnetic piece of plastic.The quality control on this keyboard is also kind of shoddy. 4 keys were off when I opened the keyboard, and the seem along the front of the keyboard, where the logo is, is very uneven. I don't see this hurting the performance in any way, but for a keyboard purchased purely for its looks, it should be put together well.The keyboard itself is alright. It does what it says on the tin, can't knock it there. It's a quality mechanical keyboard. But for the price, I'd have liked to see a bit more. Maybe a row of dedicated macro keys or a USB passthrough, stuff present on other offerings of around the same price. Because while I love the color, pink isn't a feature. So just be aware that you're trading possible functionality for aesthetic. Though, to be fair, I knew all of this going in, and hopefully so do you.",
          "I haven't owned it for very long, but I think it feels nice. Feels nice for typing, I haven't used it that much for gaming yet, but it felt nice and responsive when I used it in a limited sense. I already updated the firmware, so I haven't experienced the double typing issues others had but I would probably recommend doing that.I'm writing this review immediately just to let other people know that the wrist rest isn't plush or very ergonomic, and definitely isn't magnetic. It's just a hard plastic wrist rest that doesn't attach to the keyboard at all. Which I guess is nice since you can go out and buy a wrist rest that's more comfortable instead. I guess the hard plastic wrist rest might be a plus for some people, but in that case why not mention it in the product description? I'm not going to return the keyboard or anything, but it's frustrating, and just in case this would be frustrating to anyone else, here you go.The product listing also mentions usb 2.0 passthrough somewhere on the page, because I guess they just copied it from the blackwidow elite and didn't edit the page very carefully.",
          "I love this keyboard. Just don't get it if there are people around who are sensitive to lots of clicking.",
          "I do like the clacky-ness of this Razer keyboard, this is the 3rd Razer keyboard I've owned.  The multi-media button and roller are a unique idea, mostly i use it for PC volume adjustment and it works great for that.The wrist rest is just a plastic wedge that doesn't really connect to the keyboard in any way .  I at least expected a bit of padding on it but there is none, it's literally a plastic wedge you slide up next to the keyboard.The LED lighting on this keyboard is not very bright, i have the brightness at 100 and it's much duller than my other two keyboards.  On the other hand my other two keyboards had a bit of a frame around the grouping of keys. This one is open, the keys sit atop the base there's no frame maybe this causes diffused lighting.Anyway it's fine it works.  I don't LOVE it but it does what it needs to.  And i have to say.. the lighting configuration stuff has become stupidly complicated now i just want my keyboard to light up green and there is a ridiculous amount of steps to go through to do that.  Lighting was so much easier in Synapse 1.  Honestly i wish i could just buy a keyboard with green lights like they used to come with back in BlackWidow 1 days instead of having ot futz with all this chroma complexity now.",
          "I love the clicky sounds. You can switch out with custom keycaps too.",
          "This is a solid board with decent features. I got it on a sale over the holidays-but the keys feel cheap, and overall the keyboard has too much plastic.The silent switches are pretty silent-though Cherry MX silent definitely feels better.If it's on a sale, it might be worth a buy, but it just wasn't for me.",
          "I got this gift for my husband. He loved it! The only thing i didnt like is that it was shipped without a box. They just put the label on. He uses it for work and the typing is loud. But other than that he loves it!",
          "Got this keyboard for work. Way better than the original keyboard I had. It\u2019s super tactile and clicky and really comfortable. I don\u2019t love the wrist rest though as it\u2019s just some plastic that butts up to the keyboard.",
          "I am quite happy with how the keyboard works for gaming. The sound of the clicking from the keyboard when I type or use it to walk around and use my abilities in games is very pleasant to my ears. I would definitely recommend. However, I wish the colors of the keyboard was a little brighter in color, but that does not change my overall rating and happiness with the purchase. Whenever this keyboard breaks due to wear and tear, I really hope I will be able to buy another one if they are still available.",
          "Great keyboard, loved the feel when pressing keys. Would definitely buy again.",
          "The wrist rest is a great addition - the older model of the keyboard was prone to rusting, so by leaning your wrists on the rest, your sweat won't mess up the keyboard.",
          "Replaced an older black widow.  Love the new chroma options (my previous one was Razer green backlighting only).  The new design is much better for keeping the keyboard clean.  Solid metal base.  Keys feel great.  Opted for the yellow linear and very happy with the feel.",
          "The simple things in life count, like having your mouse and keyboard cycle through colors together.  Supposedly this is the quiet keyboard, but it's pretty loud to me.  That's OK, I'm happy with it and even like the wrist rest it comes with.  I was afraid it would slide around but it stays put.You should know that the keys can be pretty sensitive at times.  I have to watch out for stray letters upon occasion.  Of course, this could be because the keyboard is not at an \"appropriate\" height.  It sits on top of the desk and not in the drawer/tray build into the desk.Overall, I'm very happy with the keyboard, though I am not using any of the macro functions at the moment.",
          "Very clicky keyboard and fast response times for gaming.  Enabled gaming mode all the time and works great even in other apps like emails and Microsoft apps.  Took a few minutes to set up due to having to take it out of a display mode it's shipped in.  Look on line if you have issues.  Otherwise great lighting and works with Chroma.",
          "I honestly love Razer products. The ergonomic wrist thing this comes with is awesome because it's not attached to the keyboard - so you can move it around freely or decide when you do or don't want to use it. The key sounds are also like ASMR. Very clicky I love it. The backlight colors to the keys are such a nice vibe for my late night gaming, and easy to customize with the synapse software from Razer. 10/10.",

          "I really wanted to like this thing, and yet as I type this I am on a different board from the same company, as I replaced it soon after the purchase. Which begs the question, why am I rating it so highly? Well, lemme explain.First off, I wanna point out how Razer products are indeed premium and still high quality at the end of the day. There has been this bad rap going around that, \"Razer isn't what it used to be,\" and that all the stuff they have made in the last decade or so is crap. Completely untrue, the Ornata V2 was a prime example of that. Even though I personally didn't like it, doesn't mean there was no effort put into it.Secondly, another complaint I was generally seeing online when shopping for this was, people extremely disliked its companion software, Razer Synapse. I wanna just say to those people, they are whining unnecessarily and sound like petulant children, pardon my French. Their claims that it's too resource heavy make little sense to me, I watched a review on a similar product where someone claimed that the 700mb install file, that uses about 200mb of RAM for processing, was too much for them to condone using it beyond the initial set up stage. And all I have to say to them is, \"Oooowwwaaaaah, cry some more. Get a bigger hard drive and some more RAM man.\" If in 2022 you are worried about that small a file taking up that little system resources, then you need to reprioritize your life. Also, it's not hard to use at all, it has a good UI, it makes sense, I was able to get the settings I wanted in less time than it took to cook my morning breakfast. But I digress.Now that the preamble is out of the way, the device review:I can honestly say, despite it not being my cup of tea, it will be for someone. It uses a hybrid switch system which boils down to there being a membrane that actually actuates the key presses, and there is a mechanical \"switch,\" of sorts that makes a light click, and has some tactility that allows you to feel when the keys are pressed. I put switch in quotes, because it's not a traditional switch. Since that would mean it has it's own housing and springs to help actuate the key, and it would have a cross shaped hole in the keys to fit into a standard peg, but it doesn't. It has a plastic stem traditionally seen on older membrane boards, and when depressed, it causes a mechanism in the side of each key well to fire, making the distinct click, so it's quite weird in comparison to other keyboards of similar make. For example, SteelSeries has the Apex 5 which has hybrid switches that are similar to this and make the same claims, but actually have true switches instead. The result is, you get a tactile click, which I enjoy, and each press is bottomed out into a soft membrane, but since the click mechanism creates a friction drag on each press, it causes the keys to require more force to press than you might expect, or want them to. I had a few moments when I was typing on it when my keystrokes weren't being registered because I didn't use enough force to actuate them. This made touch typing a lot tougher than it should be. Which was a shame, because when everything went right, the typing experience was great. However, gaming is another story. Since the keys need more force to press, finger fatigue was a real issue. I would be playing an FPS game and simply pressing W to move forward for a few minutes made my fingers tired after a bit. I have carpal tunnel and using them like this becomes hard after an hour or two. So if you suffer from the same problems, then this might be a hard pass.On to build quality, it's very sturdy with little board flex, despite being an all plastic construction. It's big and chunky like a retro board, which I personally enjoy the look of, and the mid-profile keys are great since it's height is more than I am used to, shrinking it's profile a bit. Which the included wrist rest helps elevate the hands while typing making ergonomics pretty good since it's at just the right height. It goes on magnetically, and I had zero issues with it staying on during typing or gameplay, and if you have a desk pad that can fit it, it's simple to move and reposition the thing, as it's rubber feet are many and keep it from sliding itself. The top plastics have a matte finish with a light texture on it, and the keys have a layer of matte, rubber feeling coating as well, that unfortunately gets the grease off your fingers a bit too well, but is easy to clean in that regard. The RGB on the board is probably the nicest I have seen in a long time. It has a milky plastic backplane under the membranes that diffuses light excellently, and makes things like the sound visualizer in Synapse look great, very bright lights and a multitude of options make it one of the best in my opinion. Combined with the Razer Goliathus pad, which is the bundle I got here, it makes a wonderful light show and elevates the space a lot.All that said, I can't really recommend this except for a specific sub-set of keyboard enthusiasts. If you are not a fan of 100% mechanical switches and like the feel of membranes, but enjoy a light click when you type, this is great. But for someone who has typed on and used mechanical switches and knows how nice those feel, like myself, it's hard to come back to a membrane board like this. Again, it's not a bad experience, just not what I was looking for, so in the end I imagine this is someone's perfect board, just not my perfect board.That probably belongs to the Huntsman Elite I ordered soon after this one...",

Razer Synapse software is A1, RGB effects are on point, best feeling on a membrane keyboard you're ever going to get, and I got it for a good price too at 30 USD.Should've also included the shipping weight, because the box weighs 4.8 lbs instead of the 2.1 that the standalone keyboard weighs (important to know if you're getting it shipped to another country).",
          "Top half of this review is an overall performance overview. Bottom half is an update about quality control and slow replacement issues that made me change this from a 4- to a 3-star review.I didn't purchase this keyboard for gaming, just straight typing. I work in transcription and have many of the same problems gamers do. I type faster when the keyboard gives me the right tactile feedback, it can't be too loud, the key spacing needs to be on-point, and even ghosting is a problem. The Ornata is one of the best keyboards I've ever used and has noticeably increased my productivity.Key Feel: I'm a heavy-handed typist, meaning membrane is generally easier for me to use. However, I love a good click. Having a 'tickity-tack' sensation with depression helps me stay 'in the zone' while I type. When I'm not working, I type fastest on my Macbook Pro keyboard. Macbook keyboards are a sort of membrane/mechanical hybrid like the Ornata, which is the biggest reason I went with it. You get that 'click' while still having gentler touch. The Ornata has a more aggressive 'click' than a Macbook keyboard, but it's still that hybrid sensation.Key Height: The Ornata advertises itself as a mid-profile key on the Razer website (I don't know why all the professional reviews call it 'low profile'; it definitely isn't even by gaming keyboard standards). I liked that idea. With low-profile keys (and especially full-on chiclets), it can be too easy to hit multiple keys at once when typing at max speed. However, the keys on the Ornata 'float' above the profile of the keyboard base. The end effect definitely isn't as dramatic as high profile keys, but it's still on the higher side. I expected something shorter. Key height can play a big role in hand fatigue, especially if you're a heavy-handed typist. If they set the keys even a little bit into the base of the keyboard, or make them just a touch shorter, it would be closer to 'mid-profile.' The trade-off you get for this key seating is easier cleaning (see Cleaning down below).Anti-Ghosting: When typing quickly, I often have a problem where I'm hitting the next key in a sequence before my finger has fully \"disengaged\" the previous key. On every other keyboard I've ever used, this means ghosting. I'd get 'thes' instead of 'these' and so forth. The Ornata prevents that, and it significantly improves my work efficiency. I spend less time correcting the 'thes' and 'tht' and 'thoug's I normally have to deal with.Key Volume: I'd rate this as a mid-volume key. It's much quieter 15-year-old, 'out of the box' desktop mechanicals that pretty much go \"THUMPITY-WHACKITY,\" but it's nowhere near as quiet as my Macbook. I can still transcribe without the key volume making it hard to hear my files, but a friend of mine who works on the phone noted that their customers would absolutely be able to hear their typing. To me, the volume is too loud for a hybrid key. It seems like it's making an effort to make a sound. I think that's what bugs me the most about it. It's inorganic; it doesn't feel 'native' to the key feel. If it was even the same volume but less sharp of a sound, it would be great. If you're looking for a 'stealthy' keyboard, this definitely isn't it.Programability: TBA. I haven't messed with this yet, but I use a number of macros while I work. I'll update this review after I've fiddled with it. The one thing I will say is that the keyboard updates are a mild annoyance. Your keyboard will stop working until you restart your computer, which I found out the hard way.As an aside, the Synapse software frequently leaves a lot to be desired. I'm on the beta for the new version. It works better, but the \"upgraded\" main interface is enormous, slow loading, and ugly. Lots of negative space for no good reason. It also lacks the customization capabilities you would expect. Everything about the keyboard is customizable, but you can't customize the interface to only show the options you use. The Chroma (color-change) customization screen is still awkward to use, though it works much, much better than it used to.Color & Color Programming: Phenomenal. The color is just icing for me, but it makes my work day a lot more interesting. It's rich and lovely with a good color-to-color shift. There are a few problems with programming it. The first is that the software needs work, though the beta of the new Synapse works much better than the old one. I still have problems with the keyboard abruptly resetting the color cycle to default after updates.Cleaning: Someone asked a question about this and made me realize this keyboard is absurdly easy to clean. I have dogs that shed nonstop; fur tends to build up between keys in other keyboards. Because of the 'floating' set and spacing of the keys, I don't get as much fur between the keys, and what does get in is a cinch to get out. I can tease pretty much anything that falls between the keys out with just a napkin or my nails. It would be effortless to clean up with canned air or just a paintbrush. Even if something was stuck to the membrane, you could dampen a Q-tip or a stiff paintbrush and get it right off.Overall, definitely recommend for heavy-handed typists that have a need for speed and accuracy. I knocked off a star for it overcompensating on the click loudness and the keys being taller than they should be for true 'mid-height.'UPDATE, reduced from 4 to 3 stars:After having the keyboard for about eight months, the LEDs started glitching out. Razer customer service personnel is fantastic; I've dealt with them twice now, and they're great. I sent my original keyboard back to Razer for a replacement. I appreciated free shipping both ways, but it was ground. It took almost a month between shipping it to them and getting my replacement.Six months after I received my replacement, the black coating is starting to wear off the center of my space bar. I have a .5 inch section where it's totally worn off an a 2 inch section where it has a heavy gloss from wearing down and is about to wear off. I had a shoddy laptop keyboard's coating last a good five years longer than this. The weird thing is that this didn't even happen on my last Ornata after six months of an equal amount of use.I contacted Razer customer service. I got prompt, professional replies, and the agent checked with a particular department about my issue. Unfortunately, this is considered normal 'wear and tear,' and my warranty is considered to be from my original purchase date.Razer does offer replacement key caps, but they were out of stock when I contacted customer service.You'd think a gaming keyboard would have key coatings tough enough to withstand heavy, rapid key press abuse. Just six months is pretty pathetic. This could be a quality control flub, but if so, the Ornata definitely has QC issues; this  marks the second time something has gone wrong with a brand new Ornata within less than a year.If this were a $30 keyboard, I wouldn't care so much. But you can't have a $100 MSRP on a keyboard and have quality issues like this, let alone replacement shipping that's as slow as it is.",
          "It is a loud, precise click that might be for some, but it can get annoying for people that type a lot. I've only had the keyboard for a month now, but sometimes it bothers me to hear so much clicking when I'm typing at night and just trying to get some work done",
          "The keyboard itself is of a great quality and much quieter than traditional mechanical keyboards. If you're not somebody that cares exactly what kind of colored switch the keyboard has and what those colored switches do, and you just want a neat keyboard that's good for gaming, then this is a solid choice. The wrist rest stays attached to the keyboard by some weak magnets, and surprisingly doesn't move unless you're really trying to get it to. In other words, it slides off easy when you're trying to slide it off, but it stays on and doesn't move when you're not trying to.Before I built my new computer I was mostly used to a membrane style keyboard, and at the time of building I bought a cheap mechanical keyboard (the Redragon Kumara w/ no backlights), but over the past couple months I was thinking I should get a keyboard that lights up so I can see it while playing games in the dark, quieter typing/playing, and has a number pad, so this was a perfect fit that wasn't overtly expensive. On top of that, based on my preference and frequent use of a membrane keyboard before getting the new keyboard, this one feels so much better and familiar than the mechanical keyboard I was using before. I also had a strange problem while playing games like CSGO where I accidentally would hit the Windows key when trying to crouch or the tilde key (which opens the console) while switching weapons (to the point where I outright took those keys off). This hasn't happened at all with this keyboard, but that probably has more to do with my familiarity with membrane keyboards by comparison than a problem with my previous keyboard.However, the reason I didn't give this five stars in spite of all the good things I feel for this keyboard, is because of the Razer Synapse software you're supposed to use with it. I've read on other reviews that the keyboard lights will stop working briefly or they'll lose their custom settings because of this software, and I figured it couldn't be that bad. But as it turns out, it can be that bad, over the past couple days I've had this keyboard I've had the lights stop working occasionally and sometimes during those occurrences my keyboard won't accept input, and I can only imagine that has something to do with the software the keyboard runs with rather than something with my computer or the keyboard itself (considering that it's brand new).Yesterday afternoon I booted up my computer to see that my keyboard lights weren't reflecting my settings, so I opened the software to see if I could access or remake them, but I couldn't actually find the menu I was using the day before to set them, and it was almost as if the software wasn't recognizing the keyboard anymore. The program never prompted me for any updates, and I even checked manually in the settings, so I figured I should probably just uninstall it and install a different version. But after going into the Apps and Features menu and accessing the program's interface to uninstall it, it says in bold letters \"UPDATE AVAILABLE\", so I clicked that instead of uninstall and after applying the update, my keyboard settings were loaded immediately.That aside, I felt that creating the custom settings was a bit of a hassle and strangely vague, so it quickly became a headache to use. About an hour after I managed to set the keyboard lights how I wanted, except for the fact that I couldn't apply any lights to the arrow keys, no matter what effects I tried or how I tried them, I just couldn't get any settings to apply to them, so as it stands they're the only unlit part of my keyboard. There's also some applications on Razer's website to integrate the keyboard with Discord or games like CounterStrike and Overwatch, or you can even play Snake on your keyboard if you're that bored.Overall, this is worth a buy if you want a good hybrid keyboard for a decent price, but the Razer software can be a bit of a pain to deal with.Also, if anybody's wondering whether or not this would fit on an extended mouse/desk pad, this keyboard fits perfectly on the\u00a0",

          "For a long time, I've always loved Razer. I've heard a lot of feedback from my friends about the Ornata V2, mainly about it being great for gaming. I thought I may as well try it out myself, and I can't stop using it! I've went through many different mechanical keyboards, membrane keyboards, but this is my first mechanical feel keyboard I opted in for. The package includes:- Razer stickers- Setup guide- The included Wrist Rest- The keyboardI don't see how someone could hate the mechanical feel switches the keyboard offers. I've always played with mechanical switches (MX blues and Reds) and thought this keyboard was awesome because it offers the feel of a mechanical keyboard, but the soft cushion of a membrane keyboard. I feel like this is a great combo. I do know that you can remove the tactile bump on the keyboard to make it quieter, but I personally really like the feel of the bump. I definitely feel like the price of the keyboard is pretty hefty, especially for a membrane keyboard. So to that, I would say to get it on sale. They keyboard can be fully customized in terms of lighting, and key binding via Razer Synapse 3. I especially love the Hypershift option, bringing an entirely new set of keys to the keyboard once the Hypershift key is held down. You can set any key to do anything you really want them to do. Open a specific program, open a URL to a website, change lighting, the list goes on. They especially come useful when using Hypershift. Though I had a little bit of trouble of when the package was going to ship, the seller was very nice to me and helped me track my package. This was especially because I bought this around the holidays, so it did take longer than expected, but isn't a problem to me. As much as I wanted to opt in for the Huntsman Elite, I really think this is a nice alternative if this keyboard is on sale since they both have so much in common. One thing uncommon about them is their switches, but both are really great.The final question: Is this keyboard for you?If you want all of Razer Synapse's features, lighting and programmable keys for a good price then this keyboard is definitely a great option if it's on sale. If you want the feel of a mechanical switch, but want the soft cushion of a membrane keyboard, then this keyboard is a great option!",
          "Fire MODE! I wish my Naga Trinity ALSO did firemode so they could be in sync and look sick but it is still cool. But man it is a very responsive keyboard and very clicky. I always thought the noise of a clickykeyboard would annoy me having ALWAYS lived softkey life. But I am loving this keyboard. I play apex competitively and the audible click is starting to sync up properly with my thoughts on movement. I was doing insane maneuvers and ditching a team of 3 my hands gave out before my peripherals. The reactiveness of my movement is changing to the clicks. I realize mistakes on hand placement faster. Because I hear click and something DOESNT happen im like wtf and realize I am misplaced faster, that type of correction is CRUCIAL in moments of competitive play. ALL HAIL MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS.I have seen the light, and its bright.",
          "Nice wrist rest",
          "This is a great keyboard it is my fav and will continue to be my fav. It's clacky but not overly so and the keys have a great feel to them. The wrist rest is soft and comfortable and the lighting is just a neat plus.",
          "It is the keyboard I ordered but it\u2019s also not\u2026 technically.What arrived is the all star bundle version. If you don\u2019t know what the all star bundle is is it was a bundle that Costco offered, I believe, and it included this keyboard as well some other peripherals for a cheaper price than buying them separately. The only difference that I know of between the all star bundle version and the normal version is the box and the sticker or the back of the keyboard. Doesn\u2019t sound that bad considering how cheap I got the keyboard but I wish it was more clear that you were buying that version.I know it\u2019s a bit nitpicky but it bothers me now that when I open Razer synapse it displays the key board as an all star bundle Ornata key board because the register code for the all star bundle items are different than the normal ones.So basically what this seller did is buy up all star bundles and re sell the items individually which is a bit annoying to me.But it\u2019s still a good keyboard and I really enjoy using it.",
          "Keys feel absolutely amazing as I'm writing this. Don't really care about the colors but if you do it lights up and you can customize it, I guess. But relating to build quality, key feels, and the added wrist pad... This is amazing. Best feature Imo is the wrist pad, you will need a hard surface to use it though. It will slide off if you use this keyboard on your lap. I superglued it to the keyboard and this worked for me. The wrist pad I cannot really describe how perfect it is. Buy this, now.",
          "I already have this key board it went on sale the price was to good so I buy another because the one I have still works great. But I have but it through some work so just incase a back up. I have had it for years. I did take it out of the box to make sure it works.",
          "Good",
          "I love love this keyboard. I am personally am team logitech, the only thing not Logitech from my set up is the Razer Keyboard. I love the hybrid keys, still some clicky'ness but not too much. The wrist pad is a game changer as well. I use this keyboard for both work and gaming. I have used this for around 1 year and have had no technical issues. I do have a little wear n tear on the wrist pad, but I'm probably to be blame and not the design.",
          "This keyboard works really well if you like the tactile feel of a mechanical keyboard but aren't really keen on the extreme noise that they tend to come with. It still has a nice click but it's comfortable in volume. It's not super thunky/clunky/awkward, and I enjoy it. Space bar could use some work (spacebar rattle is a common issue) but you can probably DIY a fix for that if you care enough to. Works fine for my needs! My partner has been using one for a couple of years and I've been a fan from the sidelines, so it's nice to have my own now. Plus, RGB! Fun!I did notice my \"A\" key was silent when I bought this, but I was able to fix this by taking the key out and putting it back a couple of times. I think the switch just got jostled in transit or something, it works fine now. :)",
          "The keyboard has a soft touch feeling. The clicking sound is not loud. Very nice one!",
          "- Current Thoughts - ***UPDATE - (7/20/2017) My replacement product arrived. Eureka! This one had no issues with the super-squeaky keys, and all of the keys make sound. Interesting differences : this one is much quieter than the first one sent (so much so that I'm almost feeling like this one is defective - it barely makes more sound than my built-in laptop keyboard), also with the long keys that have a metal support, the bar is located on the side of the key that is harder to see. ***- Previous Thoughts - (7/18/2017) I have discovered that my Enter key on the Numberpad does not click AT ALL. I am quite distressed. Really, guys. For how much this keyboard cost, you send me a NON-CLICKY-BUTTON. I'm sure the melodrama will eventually pass, but I'm giving Razer a chance to reply to my review before I begin to storm the castle, flame rising in the back of my throat over a non-clicky-clicky keyboard. I shan't call it clicky if it isn't truly 100% clicky. //dragon-noises//- Original Thoughts - (7/17/17)-- Pretty darn happy with it. The clicky is so satisfying, but it doesn't hurt the fingers.- General Opinion -- Keyboard layout itself is decent, well spaced. I like the illuminated bar that indicates Caps Lock/Number Lock/et cetera. Pretty colors, although a bit more vibrant than I'd imagined. The keys with a metal support were so squeaky at first, it was incredibly annoying. Seriously, bad enough that I strongly considered returning the product. Seems to have improved over time, though. I do like that there are three avenues for the cable to pass through without inhibiting function. Love the wrist-rest. My computer is an old fogey that won't let me run Synapse, so once I get the new computer I can provide an updated review including that.- Design Notes -- The symbols keys are transposed (ie instead of / being the top part of the respective key, and ? being the bottom, they're swapped). Not too much of an issue if you don't watch your fingers when you type, but I can imagine it could get very confusing otherwise.  --  A few of the keys I have do not fully align to the keyboard - they aren't precisely parallel to the keyboard and don't fall in a straight line like the other keys do. This doesn't seem to impact function, but annoys the living hell out of me.For me, these are Space Bar and Enter.  -- Lighting on some keys doesn't shine through like the others, definitely wish that was improved. For me, the keys with less light are Backspace, - (numpad), Shift (both sides), Enter, and the top half of the ~/` key.  -- The braided power cable is alright. Already started to fray where I try to put it into the slot to keep it in place (which doesn't really work - it comes right back out). I would have used a stronger nylon-based thread.  -- The feet used to prop up the keyboard don't have the rubber grips that the keyboard and wrist-pad have.- Usage -- I use this for work and school, so it's getting used probably 12 hours a day. My hands definitely feel a lot better using this.- Usage Issues -- Super squeaky keys at first, seems to improve with wear. I was afraid to WD-40 them, but strongly considered it.- *** Update to Usage Issues - Enter key on Numberpad is click-less. The key itself seems defective, the little metal bracket on the right side will not stay in the little housing below. I managed to push it back in, but when I hit the key, the bracket rises up as the key returns to normal position. Interesting note, this was the key that was most obnoxiously squeaky when I first got it. So squeaky I avoided touching the key entirely until tonight, when I realized the squeaks were cries for help.***",
          "I love this keyboard. I got this back on my birthday in July. I wanted to give myself some time with it before I reviewed it.1) The wrist rest is amazing! I had a just regular wrist rest before I got this keyboard and the fact that I never have to worry about it sliding around is amazing, but it's also just plain comfortable.2) Just a little side note here but... thank you razer for keeping long back space keys. THANK....YOU! No one wants a short backspace button, no one.3) This is my first time with a keyboard where I can customize the RGB and WOW! Do I love it. It's not necessary by any means but it's a lot of fun to customize it every once in a while. The RGB is also pretty bright and you can see the light through the keys. So plenty easy to use in the dark if you are a night gamer like myself.4) This is subjective, but none the less. I can type with ease on this myself. There isn't much resistance and so I can type with it and game with it all day and it doesn't exhaust my fingers at all.5) The click isn't super loud to me, but it is still very satisfying to listen to.6) The keys are hard to remove which for me is a plus. I had to take my keys off the other day because I spilled a bit of soda on it and my space bar got sticky as all hell. I was actually a bit worried I would break something when I was removing the keys. This is such a plus for me because it means that I don't have to worry about keys coming loose. I have had keyboard that with time the keys came a little loose and becoming wobbly. I don't feel like that is a concern with this board. That being said, putting the keys BACK in was the easiest thing once I cleaned all the keys.Overall I love this keyboard. It's the best one I've ever had and I've had a lot of keyboards. I just don't have any memory of having a keyboard that I enjoyed using as much as this one. WELL worth the price to me. Which is also saying something for how frugal I generally am. Along with the best keyboard, this is the most expensive one I have ever had and I don't regret it for a second.",
          "This thing was made for me, I love just about everything this keyboard has to offer(with one or two exceptions, hence the 4 star rating.)I've been using this for over a month now, and it's honestly become my favorite keyboard. Rubber dome keyboards get way too much flack, It's always been my preferred method for gaming, as rubber domes are basically the same thing as traditional controller buttons, and I don't see any of these mechanical keyboard nerds soldering MX Blue switches onto their Xbox controllers if they love them so damn much. A fair criticism that's made however is this keyboard's price, it is quite steep taking into consideration that rubber dome boards are usually very cheap both to make and to purchase, but at the end of the day, Razer is a luxury brand, and luxury always comes at a price, BUT, you wouldn't even be looking at Razer products if you weren't willing to spend the extra money on luxury.Simply put, it feels like perfection, looks sleek and sexy, has a comfortable as hell MAGNETIC wrist wrest so none of that screwing it on crap or having it just sit there and wobble around and it is so plush and comfy if my wrists could speak they'd say what they just typed.Now the only issue(s) I have with this gift from the chroma gods, is synapse (and also the pegs to prop the keyboard up don't have any rubber grip, and it angles in a way that the rubber on the bottom is no longer making much contact so if you prop it up it slides around with minimal force so why even include them????)Razer, you've gone and made literal cancer into a borderline spyware computer program that I have to install to use any of your products. What this program needs to change the color of your keys is beyond ridiculous: first you need internet access, and then need to register and make a Razer account and sign in which means you agree that they can basically do whatever they want with your information submitted and that the program is actively collecting TO CHANGE THE COLORS, COLORS. I'm pretty hyped for the day Synapse4 drops and requires a valid SSN and acknowledging that various accounts or loans may or may not be opened and taken out in your name just to turn on caps lock.I'm literally taking an entire star off just because of Synapse, it's just that bad. Half the time the damn thing doesn't even work properly, put the computer in sleep mode and oops nobody bothered to put any onboard memory profiles so your keyboard is back to stock settings until you re-launch synapse and wait 5 minutes for it to finish chugging along cause it's too busy documenting and monitoring everything else you do and god forbid it actually just work.",
          "I had been experiencing issues with previous keyboards. It was a combination of key height being a bit high, along with inaccuracies when I was typing. Of course, many of the culprits were membrane keyboards. Naturally I was looking at mechanical keyboards by Corsair and others along with Razer. I fell in love with the Razer Mamba mouse and knew their products were top tier. I realized that for the $60 price point, Razer packs one heck of a punch. After watching numerous video reviews online, most of who were actually bashing the whole membrane/tactile combination, for whatever reason I still had a hunch that Razer wouldn't just put a 'hybrid mechanical' product on the market without it being pretty well r&d'd and taken to the next level in comparison to 'other' attempts. At the risk of it being a waste and the 'hybrid mechanical' rumors being true and ending up needing to go into the tier of true mechanical keyboards, I gave this keyboard a shot. I can wholeheartedly say my hunch was dead on. In a word: Smooth. This thing types butter smooth and accurate. The clicks are actually pleasant to the ear, my words per minute got a boost and I'm more accurate as well. I could not be more happy. The RGB is ridiculously good looking in person, and while I wish there were a more firm surface for the wrist rest(read: a higher quality foam or a plastic, either one), it is quite comfortable and unlike some reviews claim, it does not get hot under my wrists at all. Don't pass on this keyboard, because for under $100, this thing slays the competition, even costing a bit more, IMO. By far my favorite 'thing' about this keyboard is how Razer seemed to perfectly balance making a membrane keyboard that is hyper accurate, while giving it the 'click' many of us like in high end mechanical keyboards while making that click even more pleasant than what we are used to, while getting the key height and travel distance, well, perfect. I don't think the combination of these features is any accident. They seem to shake hands with each other quite nicely to put it lightly . All in all, if you're wondering if you need to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a 'real' mechanical keyboard, I can honestly say, I don't think you do. Give the Ornata a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
          "The mecha membrane switches just feel so good. I've been to bestbuy and microcenter and tickled every keyboard they had, I personally find this to be my favorite, even over the beloved cherry reds. The build quality is good, the rgb looks nice, and the volume wheel on the keyboard is easier to use than the icon in the taskbar. Glad the wrist rest is removable, I didnt care for it, but its included for thoose who enjoy them. Everyone of my friends that have test drove it loved it. Highly recommended.",
          "To some people good and membrane don't go together but for me, I prefer to have a membrane keyboard.  Out of the box each key has these little clips which from what I can tell only exist to make noise.  I guess to make you feel like it was more mechanical than it was.  I removed them though.  The wrist rest is very plush all be it little over half a year later it is starting to peel up being made out of some artificial leather material.  It is comfortable but I wish they chose a different material on this front.What I don't like is Razer's insistence that you use, and download their software.  You tell it you don't want to download, it downloads anyway.  You tell it you don't want it to open on startup, it does anyway.  You unplug your keyboard for whatever reason and it opens or prompts you to install it again.  I want literally nothing in your software.",

          "I've had a pretty good experience with Razer products in general, so I decided to upgrade from my old Razer keyboard (Anansi), to the new Ornata Chroma which was on sale. Of course the big selling feature with the Ornata Chroma is that the keyboard uses a \"mecha membrane\" key system. When each key is pressed down, the feeling is similar to that of a clicky mechanical keyboard. Typing feels much better compared to my old membrane keyboard. And since it uses a membrane instead of individual mechanical keys, the price is kept down.LightingThe main reason why I bought this keyboard was for the illuminated keys. The keys appear to \"float\" over the RGB lighting giving it a really cool look. The actual keys themselves have their letters lit - but the font size is rather thin, so the lighting through letters can appear a bit dim compared to other competing keyboards. Still, the keys are readily readible in the dark - which works for me.TypingI really like the feel of the typing with this keyboard. I didnt' want to spend the money for a real mechanical keyboard with RBG lighting (like the Black Window or the Huntsman), so this suits me nicely. All the keys feel great when I type long emails or documents.GamingI've played mainly FPS games and MMO's with this keyboard and it feels really comfortable. Other than the sticky issue (see below), gaming with this keyboard is good.Razer customer service helping with problemsInitially I had no problems with the Ornata Chroma. I liked it so much I ended up with three of them - one for my home PC, another for my office PC, and lastly one for a family member. However, after a week 1 of the 3 keyboards started having sticky keys. I would press down on some keys and they would not return back up after the initial keystroke. This didn't happen that often, but it was very annoying when it did. Thankfully this only plagued one of the keyboards- the other two were just fine.  I tired to fix the issue myself by cleaning the key swtches, but eventually the keys would still stick down. I ended contacting Razer's customer service. Although I had to send the keyboard back to them via Fedex (they provided the paid shipping box), the customer service was very smooth - all during a holiday break - which was quite unexpected. They literally responded to every email I sent within 1 day, and usually it was with an actual person addressing my needs specifically. The unit I received back was a brand new Ornata Chroma and it works perfectly.ConclusionIn the end, I feel that my experience with this keyboard's sticky keys is rare occurance - due to all the positive reviews that I've seen.  And if you do have any issues, I'd say that their customer service will definitely take care of you. The Ornata Chroma is a really good deal for the feel of mechanical keyboard, response of a gaming keyboard, and the fully customizable lighting that Razer provides.",
          "I've been using it for a long time and had some problems. When I clicked Ctrl, the Windows key was clicked at the same time. Had the same problem with Tab key. When I clicked the Tab button, Q was clicked at the same time. I disabled Tab and Windows keys for a while from the program. After a long time, the problem fixed itself when I activated it again. I'd better buy a full mechanical keyboard. But that's good. I haven't had any other problems in general.",
          "It came broken, Took over a month to get it, and when asked about a replacement part was told they don't exist. How do you not sell the feet separately? Also the software updats have about 40% of the time stopped it from working. I've lost my presets 4 times to an update. And the fact that it always has 2 or 3 updates in quick succession.",

          "Ive owned fully mechanical keyboards from Razer and Full membrane keyboards from Razer, i have to say this keyboard really is the perfect balance, it has the nice feel of a mechanical keyboard but the much more quiet thanks to its half membrane half mechanical design.",
          "Great keyboard overall.Keys:The keys are spaced a little more than other keyboard I've owned. Keys feel great and responsive.Noise:This keyboard is not quiet. I would say it's probably mid-range as far as sound volume. I've owned louder keyboards. I would certainly not call this a quiet keyboard.Colors:Great colors, and super helpful to have that backlight when doing tasks at night in the dark.Hand support pad:At first I didn't think I would need that pad, but now that I have it, it is great!

          "Be advised - this does not support NKRO which means you cannot hit more than 2 buttons at a time. If you're gaming with M&K this simply will not do. But if you are purchasing it for casual/work use it is acceptable for the price. My only real complaint is that the wrist rest is not magnetic. I'd recommend spending a little bit more and purchasing the Steel Series Apex 3. The switches are quieter, supports NKRO, and has a magnetic wrist wrest. It's what this keyboard should be.",
          "This was a huge stepup from my last gaming keyboard. I love the feel of the keys as it's not too loud but also gives a good sound when typing. The lighting is great, but I'm not a fan of the software (is anyone?).",

They seriously must have driven it right to my house it was that fast. Amazing price, amazing quality. Everything was in original packaging with plastic and instruction manual. Lights work and it sounds AMAZING. Very quiet, and comfortable keyboard. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Thank you!",
          "Just got the keyboard. It looks good and functions fine, but when I went to download the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lights, I read in their license agreement that Razer sells your personal information and data to third parties. And in case of a data breach at Razer, personal info and data could be accessed by bad actors. So I won\u2019t be downloading it. Luckily there is open source software to change the RGB lighting.",
          "Rule #1 for \"gaming\" keyboards is N-Key Rollover.  This means that there is not a max number of key inputs the keyboard can process at one time.  I assumed being a Razer gaming keyboard that this would be standard.  It is not.  I returned within 48 hours of receiving.  I should have read through the description in more detail.Other than that, the lights are pretty and it types nicely.  Nonetheless, do not buy if you plan on gaming.",
          "It's a great keyboard but the wrist rest is completely pathetic.. If you need it DO NOT buy this. If you don't it really is a great keyboard.",
          "Ornata V3 X:I didn't realize I ordered this keyboard used. It was less than 10% off. It appeared \"Like New\" for a few weeks until paint started chipping off the WASD keys. I would have spent the $5 for brand new.Love the keyboard though. I much prefer it to the original V3 because it's quiet.",
          "Razer as a brand used to mean something. I've owned their products before and they were fantastic. This keyboard falls way short of coming close to what I've had previously.The program/drivers used to control the color of the keyboard and use special color patterns barely works. When you pick a style, it does what the opposite of what you think it would do. Say I pick a color combo and want it to circle or fade, and it will, KIND OF. This thing flickers between colors on every setting worse than a haunted house on Halloween. If you want this for anything besides a solid color, go elsewhere, like a Corsair for $10 more.Keys are nice, everything types well and all the keys work, so that's a good thing.",
          "Simplicity and looks",
          "It has a bit lower profile compared to V2. Keys sound is louder a bit. Support bar is plastic and not comfortable. Space bar sounds a bit different. Looks cheaper in general.---Changed rating from 3 stars to 4.5-5 after almost 1 month use. It's VERY comfortable to type on. The only cons: spacebar sound differs from other keys and design of volume control looks a bit \"cheap\". But I got used to it and now it's my main driver. Do recommend 100%.",
          "I am disappointed in this as the lighting on the key surfaces is drowned out by the backlighting. I will just stop using this and look for a replacement with illuminated keys but not where the entire area under the keys is lit up. For reference, my favorite keyboard is the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard, which doesnt have this problem.Additionally, the wrist rest is not held in place, so easily slides around. If you are someone that ever moves your keyboard, and wants the wrist rest, it is a hassle.Otherwise the keyboard types fine. I like the key height and responsiveness.",
          "For daily home and business use this keyboard gets 5 stars. Great lighting, wrist pad is comfortable, and keys are nice and smooth. For gaming I have to give this only 1 star. I'm not sure if this is a defect or a fixable issue but the keyboard suffers from ghosting (box does not say it has anti-ghosting). In a nutshell you can only have a total of 3 keys actuated at once, no other keys can be activated unless one of those keys are released. If you are doing a lot of high active keyboard gaming, you are going to run into key delay issues.",
          "The arrows on this don't work and contacting customer support is no help. I have a Windows 11 and can't get any info on how to fix the arrow problem. The blogs don't help, and customer support keeps sending me the same emails over and over, send serial number model etc. Not happy at all, I need to use the arrows, what's up Razer?",
          "I bought this keyboard for the programmable lighting effect. It works well, but now is useless, and constantly set to full brightness and color change due to a hack that the manufacturer just \"fixed\" by making the synapse software inaccessible if you use this on a work computer without admin rights. Get something that is not a Razer to avoid this issue.",
          "Pressing combinations like Shift+W+A will stop you from adding a press like E, for example. This could be troublesome for some games. The keyboard itself feels excellent, but this simply stops it from being an actual gaming-grade keyboard.",
          "Perfection. Finally",
          "I dont know who lied to razer but this keyboard is not low profile. It is a regular keyboard that clicks and clacks annoyingly and that was the sole reason why I didnt want a standard keyboard. Wasted my money.",
          "Have to plug it back in every time I restart my PC.Go buy literally any other keyboard.",
          "The Razer Ornata V3x is a decent backlit keyboard, just as long as you don't plan on gaming with it. This keyboard doesn't support NKRO (N Key Rollover), and only has a 6 key rollover. What this essentially means is that if you're playing a game and you're trying to push multiple buttons at once for movement or actions, they may not all register as pressed. I wish I knew this before I bought this because aside from that, this is a really nice keyboard for the money. The backlighting is great, it's very bright compared to other membrane gaming keyboards, the membrane \"switches\" feel very nice and they're quiet compared to other membrane gaming keyboards. The design is unobtrusive and very minimal for Razer, which I personally prefer. One other con I should mention is that the included wrist rest doesn't physically attach to the keyboard, rather it just sits close to the keyboard. Aside from the two negatives I've listed, for general non-gaming use, this keyboard checks a lot of boxes. However, if you're getting a keyboard and planning to game on it, I can't recommend this because of the lack of NKRO. If you want a membrane option from Razer that does have NKRO, I'd recommend any versions of the Cynosa, if you can find them. I'm relatively certain that Amazon does have them. Also if you live close to a place like MicroCenter, they should also have it.",
          "Its great for gaming the lights for it look super cool but i would recomend a separate wrist rest but other than that its really comfortable to use and is super great quality",
          "telling you ahead, if you are big person with big hands, this may have been somewhat small for you or for your fingers as the buttons are smaller than usual.Compact ergonomic size, excellent comfort, wrist rest comes includes, close distance between buttons, very nice led lighting and high response time is amazing. Price is very very affordable!",
          "This is not supported by Mac. I see why I got it 70% off.",
          "I'm not really a keyboard person but I've always wanted to try out something 'more' and this was a nice start for me. I really like the wrist rest but as I am not used to it, I find myself removing it often. However, it is very easy to take off and put back on which is great. I really like the lighting on the keyboard. You can do multi-colored or solid and it comes with software to customize everything with it, including keybinding / macro, which I love. It's a bit intimidating though so I haven't ventured any further that that. The brightness, however, was a little distracting for someone like me who's never used a light up keyboard and does a lot of computer work and play at night. I can turn it off but it feels a bit like a waste to me as the RGB is a feature. The keys are also much quieter and 'softer' than the ones I have. I do have a personal preference for higher keys than this as I got longer nails and shorter keys make it more difficult for me to use since I type a lot. I think it's a good keyboard in general, but maybe not for someone like me.",
          "I usually stay away from membrane keyboards, they tend to be mushy and something that is not easy to get used to if you have high standards for your subjective typing experience due to primarily using mechanical keyboards. The \u201cMecha-Mebrane\u201d feature intrigued me, especially since clicky is my favorite type of mechanical switch, that combined with this being low-profile was enough to get me to order it.I think this board is a really nice option for people who want a low-profile board with Synapse integration and customizable RGB. The backlight is actually really nice-looking and I even prefer it to my DeathStalker V2 Pro, it\u2019s more of a bright and vibrant looking than normal Razer keyboards.The Mecha-Mebrane feels very close to clicky type of switches, it probably wouldn\u2019t fool a keyboard aficionado, but I doubt the average PC gamer or just regular consumer would be able to tell it wasn\u2019t a real mechanical board. It\u2019s leagues better than most membrane boards and I think it\u2019s good enough to justify the price. Although it\u2019s worth mentioning that you could get a decent budget board with RGB and wireless functionality AND with real switches for roundabout this price.One downside is it\u2019s wired only, but how big of a deal is that really? How often do you find yourself typing from farther away from your computer than 1-2 feet? The USB cable is permanently attached to the keyboard, I know some people appreciate unpluggable cables, even on wired only keyboards and controllers, but you don\u2019t get that here.On a final note, I really like the magnetic wrist rest and wish Razer would do this on their higher end keyboards, which most don\u2019t have this functionality. It\u2019s a nice touch and you don\u2019t even really need a wrist rest for low profile boards, so it\u2019s cool to see it included.",
          "This is a nice keyboard, especially for the price. It's great as a starter keyboard or basic use, but not someone who is into gaming imo. I really like the style of it and that it comes with a magnetic wrist mat. The back lighting is nuce, very bright and colorful, and you can customize how you like. It's comfortable to type on, but I feel the keys are too mushy and quiet. I like a more clicky feel and louder typing sound. I got it to use for my pc gaming, but I'm looking for another keyboard at the moment. I've been using this one to do everyday things on the computer. Overall for the price, it's a solid basic keyboard for anyone. I would recommend it, but like I said before not necessarily for gaming.",
          "This review is for: Razer Ornata V3 Gaming Keyboard: Low-Profile Keys - Mecha-Membrane Switches - UV-Coated Keycaps - Backlit Media Keys - 10-Zone RGB Lighting - Spill-Resistant - Magnetic Wrist Wrest - Classic Black (Ornata V3)I'm a fan of low-profile keys.  These are somewhat low-profile, but now as low-profile as I'm used to.  They are also clickier than I would like.  I know it's not popular, but I'm not a fan of clicky keys.The backlighting is pretty spectacular looking.  I haven't had an RGB keyboard before.  If it were based on looks, I would give this keyboard 5 stars.I would say for the price, this is a pretty nice keyboard.  Keyboards are a pretty personal item... everyone has different preferences.I'm not sure that this will be my go-to keyboard, but it is nice.  I don't use my PC for gaming, so I can't speak on it as a gaming keyboard.Hope this was helpful.",
          "I'm a HUGE fan of RAZER gear. I selected this keyboard for the main editing station in my podcast studio. Soft touch keys are not for me. I love the old-school tactile feel of a gaming keyboard and this model does not disappoint.The magnetic, removable wrist rest is a great touch as well.I've gone through 5+ gaming keyboards in the past 4 years in my editing space and this is truthfully the best one I've encountered by far. This keyboard offers an exceptional tactile experience at an extremely valuable price point. I couldn't be more pleased.Rating: 5 stars. Highly recommended.",
          "My nearly 14-year-old son spends more hours per day gaming than I'd like to admit.  He has gone through quite a few keyboards in his lifetime.  His most recent keyboard has been an Alienware keyboard that was more than $100, though I struggled to find the exact model for you.  Anyway, when I had the chance to try out this Razer keyboard as an Amazon Vine Reviewer, I jumped at it, as he loves Razer products, as well.  Unfortunately, prying him away from his computer long enough to get him to try this keyboard was not easy.It didn't take long for my son to decide that he wanted to keep using this keyboard instead of his Alienware.  When I asked him why, his first response was that this keyboard is so much quieter.  I will definitely attest to that!  We were all so used to hearing his Alienware keyboard going clickety clack that we hardly remembered what silence sounded like.  Wonderful!  To be fair, it is not truly silent, but compared to other keyboards he has owned, this one is VERY quiet.In addition to being quiet, this keyboard is very responsive for gamers.  I know that my son has rejected really expensive keyboards because there were not responsive, or keys stuck or repeated.  No such complaints here.  This appears to be a real performer.Of course, I have to mention value.  At the current price of $69.99, this is truly an exceptional value.  He has owned many keyboards that sold for more than $100, and this high performer sells at quite a discount to $100.  Amazing.Lastly, like all Razer products, it is a quality product, from the aesthetic design and lighting right down to the packaging.  Everything here says premium.We have no complaints and lots of praise for this keyboard--an easy 5 stars!  Buy with confidence!",
          "I am really picky when it comes to keyboards, not for gaming but for typing in my office.  I already replaced this one because it just didn't work for me as well as others.  It's a good quality build and easy and comfortable to type.  It's definitely not silent typing, it is actually a bit noisy.  I didn't like that I wasn't able to make the backlight only one color, it is constantly multiple colors.  I never used the wrist rest with it because it's just hard plastic and it wasn't really necessary.  I was just unimpressed.",
          "First off this isn't a mechanical keyboard in a traditional sense. Keyboard is very clicky, and pretty loud with its clicks.  Lighting options are great and love that it has multimedia buttons directly on the right hand side above the numpad for ease of use.  The keys are spaced pretty well from each other to allow you to type well using it.  The keys have a chiclet kind of style to them, meaning the kay itself is really only on the top with a much longer stem to connect the key to the board. No real wobble in the keys with this, which is what I was worried about.  I have to say I use this keyboard at work as my office keyboard and it does just fine. Typing is smooth and fast and no issues with day to day usage.",
          "The keys feel pretty good, they click well, they respond well, and they are sized well for accurate controls. It's got a shorter travel but they were easy to get used to. The pad is pretty good and keeps my wrists comfortable for hours. The only problem I had was when a few times the keyboard wasn't registering all the clicks in a complex sequence. It also feels like a budget model. The keys don't have the most pleasant clicks. Theres not much weight to it and the whole thing is plastic. It's a good budget keyboard, but not the most competitive in quality for this price range.",
          "This is a really good keyboard, but something about it still feels like an OEM keyboard with lights. (Note: I use this keyboard to type, not game, and I type A LOT)That being said, THE LIGHTS ARE AWESOME, Razer has always excelled at it's lighting (The software to control it is another story) and this keyboard does not disappoint, it has more color combinations than I've ever seen, I just have it on the basic color spectrum, shift, and it never seems to run out of colors!"

LOVE the design of this keyboard- Customizable RGB in using the Chroma studio from Razer which is EASY to useI was using a pretty cheap 60% keyboard before this and it was not satisfying at all the use and if i had a nickle for every time i hit the wrong key on it while gaming or typing, i could buy a private island. lol This has truly taking my gaming to another level because of how good this board feels and how comfortable it is to use and get used to.Oh.... where are the cons u ask?Cons:- Figuring out what game to test this beauty on first :P10/10  Enjoy!",
          "Really great small form keyboard. I am pleasantly surprised!Silky smooth typing experience and great responsiveness when gaming. Not much key \"wiggle\" they feel nice and solid and make a good (but soft) sound when typing on them. Nice actuation and they are quiet (Linear optical switches). Well worth the money for this. It's amazing once you realize you don't have to move your arm so far to get to/from your mouse!",
          "This is my first quality keyboard and first 60% keyboard.  Previously I only had a red dragon keyboard so I do not have much experience with better options.  What I really like about the Razer products is all of the customization.  I am able to customizer the color scheme on the keyboard and adjust the speed of color change as well as what color each individual key is.  I like the sound of the click on this board as well.  It has some clicking but not as much as a lot of other gaming keyboards.  It's enough for me to hear but not too much to where it's all my stream will hear through my microphone.  The only part of the keyboard that does not feel as high quality is the space bar.  I noticed this right away and it was kind of weird to me since the space bar is probably the most used button on a keyboard.  If you're looking to get a 60% keyboard I would just make sure you mostly use the keyboard for gaming and not typing.  Because of the size you're missing easy access to many buttons.  You will have to use the function key in order to use delete, Page up, home, arrow keys etc.  Also the layout has taken a minute for me to get used to where my fingers are on the keyboard when I am typing.",

          "I recently purchased the Razer Huntsman Mini and have been extremely satisfied with my purchase. The compact size of the keyboard is great for saving desk space and making it easier to take on the go. The linear optical switches are fast and smooth, making it perfect for both gaming and programming.I love the customizable RGB lighting and the fact that it can be controlled through the Razer Synapse software. The build quality is solid and it has a sleek, modern design.One potential downside is the lack of dedicated media keys and macro programming, but for my needs, these features are not a deal breaker. Overall, I highly recommend the Razer Huntsman Mini for anyone in need of a compact, high-performance keyboard.",
          "I purchased this for my grandson for gaming. He says it fills his purpose just fine.",
          "Well, I've officially been converted over to the 60% keyboard gang. I am never going back to a full so long as I live.I did my research on keyboard across different classes and brands.I was looking for portability since I travel a lot for work.With great portability aat a solid peice point the Razer huntsman is the most versatile choice for gaming and ergonomic needs.This keyboard is well made and has smooth key input with the satisfying mechanical sound.My only gripes are the LEDs are a bit dim compared to competitors (some people prefer that) and there is a high pitched ping noise each time a key is pressed when using an audio jack into my computer. I wear headphones 90% of the time so it's not an issue for me just annoying. It's takes some adjust not having the number pad and having to click FN key for any shortcuts. Also, if you're a clumsy typer like me you may accidentally click FN and another shortcut key like SCRN LK which will cause your key to stay white. After 2 hours of troubleshooting and talking to Razer customer service (they didn't tell me the issue) I figured it out from a Reddit post, lol.Great keyboard for travel and gaming needs, I just hope it lasts for a couple years.",
          "Don't wait any longer, the clicky optical version definitely satisfies your love of the clicky sound on a mechanical keyboard. It's the perfect size for small space setups, I definitely recommend the white one over the black depending on your desk design setup.",

I am never going back to a full so long as I live.I did my research on keyboard across different classes and brands.I was looking for portability since I travel a lot for work.With great portability aat a solid peice point the Razer huntsman is the most versatile choice for gaming and ergonomic needs.This keyboard is well made and has smooth key input with the satisfying mechanical sound.My only gripes are the LEDs are a bit dim compared to competitors (some people prefer that) and there is a high pitched ping noise each time a key is pressed when using an audio jack into my computer. I wear headphones 90% of the time so it's not an issue for me just annoying. It's takes some adjust not having the number pad and having to click FN key for any shortcuts. Also, if you're a clumsy typer like me you may accidentally click FN and another shortcut key like SCRN LK which will cause your key to stay white. After 2 hours of troubleshooting and talking to Razer customer service (they didn't tell me the issue) I figured it out from a Reddit post, lol.Great keyboard for travel and gaming needs, I just hope it lasts for a couple years.",
          "Don't wait any longer, the clicky optical version definitely satisfies your love of the clicky sound on a mechanical keyboard. It's the perfect size for small space setups, I definitely recommend the white one over the black depending on your desk design setup.",
          "I bought this keyboard in white over a year ago. If you want a very clicky keyboard to game with, this is it. Great feedback. I\u2019ve noticed though that it does need to be cleaned thoroughly every few months to stay responsive. If you\u2019re using a keyboard you should do this regardless. No matter how clean you are, you will get normal gunk in there from usage. Not the best for gaming and work if you work with numbers. Compact keyboard don\u2019t come with 10-key so just keep that in mind if you\u2019re going to school and need that function. This is a fantastic gaming keyboard. Several light settings. Key caps do come off for easy cleaning and it doesn\u2019t feel low quality. I recommend buying wrist support and cleaning your keyboard every so often for the best experience. Keys can get sticky after normal wear and tear for a prolonged period of time. Make sure you\u2019re taking care of it. This product seems really sturdy and well built and comes with \u201ccare equipment\u201d to get your caps off easily.",

RGB is stunning on this board the chroma stands out and pops off of the board.",

          "\u00a0This keyboard is for gaming & I like it it's not that loud & it feels nice And it has this Matt Finish. To it it feels good on my fingers & I have so much more room by my desktop now instead of using a full keyboard",
          "I bought this keyboard for my wife but once it came in I had to order me! We both love this keyboard!!!",
          "First off, this is a great product overall and is a stark difference from a traditional, non-mechanical, wireless keyboard.  Very happy with the purchase and the product as a whole.  It is very responsive and I have noticed a big improvement while gaming - even typing this review is more enjoyable with the Razer red linear optical switches!That said, I did have a couple of defects with mine and had to request an exchange - I would expect this case was an exception as I have been very happy with my Razer Mamba Wireless mouse and have heard generally favorable things about Razer products.  If you came here wondering if you should get it, I would say to go for it if it checks all the boxes for your needs in a mechanical and/or 60% keyboard.For those curious about my issue/experience, read on...after the first time using the keyboard, I noticed the \"U\" key was lit up white instead of the RGB lighting I customized in Synapse (cycled through a few light settings to check).  I was not able to fully isolate the issue, but mainly noticed it while playing Apex Legends.  I have all in game lighting affects turned off so it doesn't sync with games so I am not sure what the issue was.  After booting/waking up my PC, the keyboard is fine, or when waking the keyboard after it times out (setup for timeout after 5 minutes).  I also noticed it while playing Warzone the next day.  My other issue was a bit more concerning, but less \"severe\": 3 keycaps were partially not shining through with the back lighting - a very blatant QA issue that should not happen with a product at this price point.  The \"e\" on the \"esc\" key, the \"b\" on the \"tab\" key and the \"p\" on the \"caps\" key all had black spots that were blocking light from shining through.  I took off the \"esc\" keycap and saw some black plastic in the corner stuck beneath the white/clear coating (below the thin, black top of the key is a clear/white layer for the shine through on the letters/numbers/symbols whereas the edges are the thicker black plastic).  I have included a picture of the underside of the problem keycaps.  I gently tried to nudge the black plastic off as not to break the keycap, but it wouldn't budge.  The \"tab\" and \"caps\" keys have a square of the clear/white coating completely chipped away.  Not sure how that is resulting in the blocked light unless the clear/white coating diffuses the light, but it does look slightly different than the \"esc\" keycap defect.  I ended up chatting with Razer support and was told I needed to open an exchange with the reseller.  Not the answer I was hoping for, but I guess I wasn't really sure what to expect in the first place (sending me 3 new keycaps seems cost prohibitive and does not seem as effective of a solution - especially if the lighting on the \"U\" key persists).  Already have the exchange confirmed with Amazon and will send the defective one back ASAP.  Overall seemingly minor issues, but disappointing given the price point and overall reputation of this brand.",

          "I have been a fan of razer products for a long time because honestly their hypershift functionality hasn't been able to beat anything in my mind. Having another set of keys within the same hand mapping just by pressing another button on my mouse is so convenient since I mainly play shooting games. The issue I have with this keyboard specifically is that the hypershift button also activates the function keys. Razer synapse also doesn't let you remap this so there's no real way around it. On the Hunstman mini specifically, the \"w\" key is mapped to the \"windows volume up\" function key so when you're trying to move forward in game, you're stuck changing the volume instead which essentially screws you in a pvp match. Can you train yourself to not pressing the hypershift key while moving forward? Sure. But you should also be able to remap a keyboard that's advertised as remappable. I also get that they had to move those keys somewhere since it's a smaller board but why did it have to be the \"wasd\" keys of all things?Other than that issue, the keyboard still feels great. Since it's a smaller profile, it takes up less space on my desk. Keys feel great and responsive. Audible but not too noisy like other keyboards (personal preference). RGB is bright and vibrant. It's everything you'd expect from a razer product. But if the hypershift functionality is a big reason for why you like razer products, and desk real estate isn't as big of an issue for you, I would stick with their bigger keyboards.",

          "I just want to put this out there, this keyboard is NOT a scam. Hear me out about this keyboard. Razer is a huge company in the gaming scene of many games (Fortnite for me).  Seeing their name pop up everywhere gives me comfort when I buy their products.Queue 1 week ago, my slow, old, ugly keyboard was really not keeping up with the speed I needed and wanted in game (Fortnite). I needed a new one and Razer came to mind.  Seeing all the pros dominate and put down enemies with this keyboard really pushed my desire for the thing.  BUT I didn\u2019t want to be dumb so like any person, I watched reviews, read reviews, and even checked more commercials.  This is the time I start to doubt this keyboard.After seeing tons of videos about how bad this keyboard was, I really worried if I should fall into Razer\u2019s hands and buy this keyboard. After days of conflict, I decided to buy it. Seeing almost every pro use it made me think if it really was that bad.  I won\u2019t regret this decision.Once this keyboard arrived, I found myself in love. All the things that the people had said were not true at all.  I even put on HyperX Pudding key caps and they still worked.  The Razer Synapse software was easy, convenient, and well-designed. Though the RGB could have been better and brighter, it will still satisfy your hunger. The switches were awesome. They were so fast at 1.0 mm actuation point that I was blown away. The small form factor also benefits players like me (in Fortnite).  The weight did not bother me at all and the keyboard didn\u2019t \u201cslide\u201d at all (though I did put it on my mousepad).  The look is sleek and minimalistic and you can see the letters clearly.  Overall, please buy this keyboard if you are an FPS gamer. It is so worth it and you will not regret it.However there are a few things I must mention: I recommend putting this on your mousepad to stabilize the keyboard and dampen vibrations making it feel \u201cfaster\u201d.  Also, I recommend downloading Chroma Studio for better control of your RGB in your Razer Synapse software. Lastly, I\u2019d recommend staying on the original keycaps that the keyboard comes with because they are so perfectly grippy, comfortable, and sleek.That\u2019s it from me. I really hope you do consider this keyboard because I did and I did not regret it. I hope you all stay safe during these times and cave in to your Gaming desires.  Thanks for listening and have a great day!",
          "IMPORTANT: Make sure the seller of the keyboard is Amazon.com. Unfortunately I did not check the seller of the product and thought I was getting a great deal for a new keyboard (as advertised), instead got aused/refurbished keyboard from the seller Bilsonic. I got a refund and got a new one directly from Amazon.The keyboard itself is great, the keycaps are made with PBT plastic that makes them feel great and never get that \"oily\" look normal keycaps usually get. I'm using this Keyboard for gaming with a PS5 andcoding/regular use on a Mac and it works great with both devices.Getting used to using the \"FN\" key to use the arrows and the other functions of the keyboard wassurprisingly easy and I do not missing having a full size keyboard. The feel of the proprietary clicky optical switches is great and comparable with other keyboards I've used with MX blue switches, however, I do wish it had better stabilizers as these ones make a very subtle rattly noise.I don't really care for RGB in a keyboard; however, I noticed that the brightness of this keyboard's RGB is notas high as my previous keyboard. I've found that the keycaps it comes with do not let light through as much, and when changed for other keycaps that let light through it looks great.",
          "So I\u2019m a Razer power user. My entire setup aside from my speakers and monitor is Razer. So i have a lot of experience with quite a few of their products.My main keyboard is the Pro Type Ultra which is a fantastic, heavy keyboard that has support for use of 4 devices simultaneously and when wired, is faster than any other board in Razer\u2019s lineup short of the Hunstman Elite with 0.7 ms click latency. Amazing.This keyboard is still blistering quick but at 3.5 ms latency, is a touch slower. Not in a way any user would notice it. I know I didn\u2019t.First impressions of the board is that the Huntsman Mini is sturdy, but much lighter than the full size I\u2019m used to. That was good to me. I wanted to try a compact board for gaming. I hadn\u2019t had per key Chroma illumination. Was fun on Halo Infinite to see the Chroma effects I\u2019m accustomed to stretch to each key.That said, the clickiness was a hit and miss experience. I loved the feel of the clickiness, but the sound, particularly the space bar stabilizer, was squeaky as well. But it is overall very pleasant to type on.However, with typing tests between my two boards, my words per minute and accuracy were higher on my usual Pro Type Ultra. The Pro Type actuates much quicker with its Yellow switches, barely having to push the key before it\u2019s input registers. The Hunstman also doesn\u2019t have a long actuation point, but the nature of the switch means that you do end up bottoming out the key simply by means of using force to overcome the resistance of the switch.Keycaps themselves are amazing. Even if I return this, I\u2019m buying doubleshot PBT keycaps for the rest of my keyboards. No going back to ABS.I suspect had I got the linear switches, I\u2019d be quite happy with this board and give it five stars. If you like click, this will be a joy to use for you.UPDATE: I purchased the Red switches as well. Very nice to type on (more silent than the Pro Type Ultra, which is advertised as silent). Aside from the space bar stabilizer, none of the annoying squeaky reverb that happens on the clicky. Pay up and go red if you give this board a go. I\u2019m personally still torn between this and my Pro Type Ultra. The form factor is really the only thing that has me going back and forth, since I need spreadsheet entry often and the Pro Type already has a 10 key built in. It\u2019s lower latency than any keyboard, including this one, in Razer\u2019s lineup when wired. Tough call.",

          "As someone who spends a lot of time on the keyboard for work and personal projects this keyboard has been really amazing. I have only had it a few days but I am in love with the sound and feel of the keys. The switches seem like they will last a long time without having to do much, if any, maintenance on my part. Key caps have a great texture, F and J are easy to feel out, and the brightness of the north facing LEDs is clear but not too bright. The body feels well build and there is very little flex.The only thing that I can say I really dislike is the FN key and secondary key placement. I very rarely need to use my arrow keys but when I do it's nice to have them on or close to the home row (like vim keys). This does with having them on I (up), J (left), K (down), L (right) keys. They also put the only FN key to the right of the space bar. I have to use my pinky to hold the FN and use my other fingers to attempt to use arrow keys like I would on a full or TKL keyboard. It's not comfortable and they could have easily shortened the space bar to add an FN key on the left side. What I ended up doing is setting it up in the software for the keyboard (Synapse) so that when I hold FN I use ASDF as arrow keys. I would have done WSAD because that feels obvious and natural but they are already set as FN keys and you cannot remap them. Not a breaking point but it would have been nice to have a right side FN key.",

The two missing features are:(1) There is no auxillary USB port for a wireless mouse dongle.  This means either the dongle is going to be relatively far away from the mouse (making wireless mice a bit less reliable), or one has to contend with more cords.(2) The keyboard has some heft to it, but nothing compared to the larger Razer keyboards.  Meaning that it is fairly easy to knock it around while typing.  I'm thinking of getting some weights to glue onto the bottom to make it a bit heavier.  Also no palm rest for some reason.  They could have included one.Beyond that it works as expected.  The key caps and spacing are very similar to a normal Razer keyboard, just without the function keys, the cursor pad, the number keypad, or palm rest.  Suitable when modest portability is desired.  Key action is good.Not sure I would call it a 'gaming' keyboard without a separate function key line or palm rest, but meh...",

Really easy to remap and use.So, the only downsides I saw to this keyboard were some aspects of its quality, not sure if it's just me or the same to everyone else but some keys look like they're missing a little bit of paint where the letters/numbers reside, or at least that's what it looks like to me. Also, the rgb on it isn't bright enough like other mechanical keyboards I've tried (from friends).One other thing is the fact that it doesn't come with a wrist rest, which is a huge downside to me as I really loved it on my ornata v2.Aside from the bad, it's a great keyboard, love its feel and the small amount of space it takes on my desk, would highly recommend to buy.",

These are almost like cherry red silent switches, although you can here the key bottoming out. Some of my switches rattle more with their design, especially the space bar. Build wuality is decent although it feels too light. I wish they did this with an all aluminum frame like HyperX. Overall, I think it's a fine board for gaming, but I don't know if I would recommend it at full price with other boards available as this about two years old. I picked it up on Prime Day foe $80, and I think thats a fair price for it."

          "I've had this keyboard for a few months and use this primarily for work.  Since working remote I've been using the Logitech Wave Ergo Keyboard (because it was cheap) but started getting tired of mushy and loud keys.  I've never had a mechanical keyboard before nor did I know they existed.  I spent a long time doing my research trying to figure out what I wanted and settled on red switches.  My boyfriend has a Razer BW with green switches but it's so loud that I can hear it from across the room even with a tv on full blast.  Linear reds seemed to be the best for what I needed because I like having a quiet space to work from home.I honestly laughed when reading reviews that said they were the key presses were \"smooth,\" \"buttery,\" and \"satisfying\" but boy people were right!  It's relatively quiet and the sound isn't so annoying like the Logitech Wave.  I've also taken this to my office if I need to be on site in an open space.  I was worried about the sound but no one has said anything to me.  There was a bit of a learning curve because the keys need less force so I would press a key on accident.I think I went overboard as I'm not a PC gamer and don't need things like macros (but might use for work) but I liked having the option to have RGB lighting so my desk doesn't look so drab and like other reviews have said it's not as bright and there are a couple of keys where it's dim.As much as I would like to buy another one to have at my physical office location I can't justify the price point but overall I'm pretty happy with it.Other thoughts:Magnetic writstrest is a plusRazer software could be better",
          "My Logitech keyboard died a week before Thanksgiving. In an effort to escape Logitech's software (and modern hardware quality control), I decided to give the Razer Huntsman V2 (w/ Razer Red switches) a chance.Sure, it's not a custom mechanical setup with exotic Japanese switches, but it gives a premium enough feel. I love the sound dampening, the smoothness of the keys, and the relatively short actuation distance. It's not silent, per se, but it's the quietest keyboard in my house (including various laptops).I've seen comments online suggesting the keys don't light up bright enough. I'm partial to more subdued keyboard lighting, and I can vouch for the fact that I haven't had to dim the board much. Other brands use lighting that glows substantially around the keys, instead of just through the letters. Some of Razer's marketing images show bright halos around the keys, and some show none at all. In practice, they glow a little at the top of each key, but not very much at all.The only serious downside I encountered was with Razer's software. It's not very intuitive in general. But my specific complaint is that it isn't easy to use external tools to switch game profiles. I really wish these hardware companies would open source their software!Now, for why I returned it in a week. The Huntsman V2 Analog popped up on sale over Black Friday weekend for only a few buck more than I spent. I figured it was a no-brainer upgrade--how wrong I was.The analog version has added lighting around the base of the board (it looks great!) and offers analog functionality on every single key. Plus it has slightly stiffer springs. Unfortunately, it has none of the sound dampening of the regular Huntsman V2, and the keys give a loud, drum-like clack when bottomed out or rebounding.Analog, on a keyboard, is a bit of a gimmick, but one cool thing the analog version offers is adjustable actuation points. This gives you the ability to tune your typing and gaming experience.I agonized over the stiffer springs and loud typing. Ultimately, I returned the regular, quiet Huntsman V2 in favor of keeping the loud, but adjustable, Huntsman V2 Analog. Though I very seriously considered keeping both!!",
          "Its very comfortable with the leather rest. I bought the clicky keys by accident. They are not dampened at all. I had a Razor back widow elite series but the wrist rest wore really bad on my left had due to Iwatch. That is the only reason i upgraded. It still works and looks like new. I do like this keypad though. Love the entertainment right-hand upper section for music while gaming. Its great! Overall i love it. The wrist rest feels awesome and is square instead of tapered so it really fits well. Im bumbed i didn't get the type with RGB around the outer edges of the wrist rest. I thought i did. Their web page makes you think you're getting everything the video says. But your not, unless you happen to choose those options which they dont have on this amazon page. Also its not near as bright as Blackwidow. So taking a star for that. Otherwise same best gaming gear ever.",
          "I\u2019ve been using my keyboard a couple months now and it\u2019s absolutely amazing for gaming. I love how well the switching actuate and how quiet they are.I will say it\u2019s a little different when trying to actually type in it, but I\u2019ve noticed it being a little harder with all gaming switches that typing is a little bit of a struggle compared to some super clicky blues or something.I\u2019ve been away from Razor for some time, but came back to try this keyboard and their mouse for the 8k polling rates. No regrets with either purchase!While I think their media controls are a little lacking, and the volume wheel is a bit inconvenient compared to how Corsair has their media layout, this isn\u2019t a deal breaker.Last but not least, I\u2019m not a fan that gaming mode doesn\u2019t have dedicated buttons on keyboard even if tiny.

          "I've had this keyboard for a few months and use this primarily for work.  Since working remote I've been using the Logitech Wave Ergo Keyboard (because it was cheap) but started getting tired of mushy and loud keys.  I've never had a mechanical keyboard before nor did I know they existed.  I spent a long time doing my research trying to figure out what I wanted and settled on red switches.  My boyfriend has a Razer BW with green switches but it's so loud that I can hear it from across the room even with a tv on full blast.  Linear reds seemed to be the best for what I needed because I like having a quiet space to work from home.I honestly laughed when reading reviews that said they were the key presses were \"smooth,\" \"buttery,\" and \"satisfying\" but boy people were right!  It's relatively quiet and the sound isn't so annoying like the Logitech Wave.  I've also taken this to my office if I need to be on site in an open space.  I was worried about the sound but no one has said anything to me.  There was a bit of a learning curve because the keys need less force so I would press a key on accident.I think I went overboard as I'm not a PC gamer and don't need things like macros (but might use for work) but I liked having the option to have RGB lighting so my desk doesn't look so drab and like other reviews have said it's not as bright and there are a couple of keys where it's dim.As much as I would like to buy another one to have at my physical office location I can't justify the price point but overall I'm pretty happy with it.Other thoughts:Magnetic writstrest is a plusRazer software could be better",
          "My Logitech keyboard died a week before Thanksgiving. In an effort to escape Logitech's software (and modern hardware quality control), I decided to give the Razer Huntsman V2 (w/ Razer Red switches) a chance.Sure, it's not a custom mechanical setup with exotic Japanese switches, but it gives a premium enough feel. I love the sound dampening, the smoothness of the keys, and the relatively short actuation distance. It's not silent, per se, but it's the quietest keyboard in my house (including various laptops).I've seen comments online suggesting the keys don't light up bright enough. I'm partial to more subdued keyboard lighting, and I can vouch for the fact that I haven't had to dim the board much. Other brands use lighting that glows substantially around the keys, instead of just through the letters. Some of Razer's marketing images show bright halos around the keys, and some show none at all. In practice, they glow a little at the top of each key, but not very much at all.The only serious downside I encountered was with Razer's software. It's not very intuitive in general. But my specific complaint is that it isn't easy to use external tools to switch game profiles. I really wish these hardware companies would open source their software!Now, for why I returned it in a week. The Huntsman V2 Analog popped up on sale over Black Friday weekend for only a few buck more than I spent. I figured it was a no-brainer upgrade--how wrong I was.The analog version has added lighting around the base of the board (it looks great!) and offers analog functionality on every single key. Plus it has slightly stiffer springs. Unfortunately, it has none of the sound dampening of the regular Huntsman V2, and the keys give a loud, drum-like clack when bottomed out or rebounding.Analog, on a keyboard, is a bit of a gimmick, but one cool thing the analog version offers is adjustable actuation points. This gives you the ability to tune your typing and gaming experience.I agonized over the stiffer springs and loud typing. Ultimately, I returned the regular, quiet Huntsman V2 in favor of keeping the loud, but adjustable, Huntsman V2 Analog. Though I very seriously considered keeping both!!",
          "Its very comfortable with the leather rest. I bought the clicky keys by accident. They are not dampened at all. I had a Razor back widow elite series but the wrist rest wore really bad on my left had due to Iwatch. That is the only reason i upgraded. It still works and looks like new. I do like this keypad though. Love the entertainment right-hand upper section for music while gaming. Its great! Overall i love it. The wrist rest feels awesome and is square instead of tapered so it really fits well. Im bumbed i didn't get the type with RGB around the outer edges of the wrist rest. I thought i did. Their web page makes you think you're getting everything the video says. But your not, unless you happen to choose those options which they dont have on this amazon page. Also its not near as bright as Blackwidow. So taking a star for that. Otherwise same best gaming gear ever.",

          "I originally got this Razer keyboard (linear optical as a secondary compliment to a Logitech G915 TKL wireless/wired keyboard, since the G915 TKL is thinner.But the more I got used to this Razer keyboard, the less I wanted to use the G915 because of how responsive the Razer keyboard is.According to RTINGS, the input latency (which is the time it takes for a keystroke to be registered) between both G915 and Razer Huntsman v2 keyboards are as follows:G915:Latency Wired 1.3 msLatency Receiver 1.9 msLatency Bluetooth 8.9 msRazer Huntsman v2:Latency Wired 0.5 msLatency Receiver N/ALatency Bluetooth N/AThe 0.5 ms is definitely noticeable, especially when you set the Keyswitch Optimization to \"gaming mode\" within the Razer Synapse software, which removes the \"button debounce\". The alternative mode to gaming mode is called \"Typing mode\" which introduces a debounce delay to prevent extra inputs from being registered (to prevent typos).I use it with 1000hz polling rate. Anything higher like the advertized 8000hz is not really necessary, especially the extra load that the CPU will experience at that level. You may have a few typos as you get used to the feel of the key presses, but once you lock it in, it is going to be very hard to go back to any other keyboard except this.I also use it without the wrist rest just fine while on a Uplift desk. With a wrist-rest, it's fine also, but I don't like the idea of having to constantly reposition the wrist rest whenever I move the keyboard, since it's not attached.Overall, if you want a competitive edge, with PBT keys that last, with a TKL form-factor, with an optional wrist-rest, don't hesitate to buy this.

Not the brightest razer keyboard, and some a couple of keys (left alt, b) aren't evenly lit due to the keycap's design.Still, best spacebar, enter, and backspace keys I've ever touched. By far quieter than other linear keyboard in the same price range. By comparison, the Apex Pro is like banging the desk with a hammer.If you got this on a sale it wouldn't be a waste of money. If you're here for a linear keyboard, this is it. If you're here for lighting, maybe others will have more impressive lighting, but the customizability on Razer's lineup is unmatched.

          "I don't dislike or hate this keyboard; it's just expensive for what you get.Logitech has better features (better battery for their wireless models, and much better mice), but for whatever reason, always use low-profile key switches.I went with the \"tactile\", non-clicky key switches, and the optical sensor is so sensitive, that resting your hands on the keys will sometimes cause a miskey. So, it took a little getting used to. That said, if you're playing games with it, perhaps the sensitivity is desired.The cable is a decent length, but you're not going to run it across a room (and don't bother with their wireless keyboards), the customization options are mostly decent, but the software is clunky, and they don't allow key re-mapping for certain keys (which is silly).I wanted to disable the Windows Key for gaming, or to re-map, but was unable to. You are about to disable or re-map and create profiles (where the Synapse software is supposed to recognize running apps and switch between keyboard profiles), but I've yet to have that work.The media keys are okay, but it would've been nice to have some Logitech-style macro buttons on the left side for gaming.The lighting array is really hit-or-miss. I don't like pulsing rainbows, and opted to simply backlight the keys with as-close-to-white backlight as possible. Some of the lighting seems uneven and not particularly bright. It's just not as clean as even my decade-old Logitech K800.Would I pay $200 again? Probably not. Maybe for ~$160, it's not such a bad deal. I just wish Logitech would embrace taller key caps.",

The wrist wrest is comfortable and fatigue is next to nothing. The optical switches are great for gaming and while it is not clicky, adjusting to the actuation point is smooth and zero phantom strokes.  The spacing feels a little closer than the Corsair, but not by much. Media keys are great and the wheel is nice and low profile on the side. Size is comparable to the K70 and fits on my tray without problem.Couple of thing you should know before you buy. 1) There is no USB/media passthrough. It does only take up one usb slot on your computer, but if you utilized it before, you will not with this keyboard. 2) I wish the media wheel did more. It works fine for volume and mute, but setting up anything else takes some work and there is not a lot there that really makes it anymore than that. 3) And this is a big OCD thing. The magnetic wrist wrest does not physically attach to the keyboard. So if you reposition the keyboard, you have to reposition the wrist wrest, and even if you don't, there is not left/right stabilization. 4) Unless you are changing the color of the keycaps, pudding/phantom keycaps will not illuminate around the key. The LED is located at the top of the optical switch.All and all it's an amazing keyboard. At the price point, you are really comparing it to the K100.

There are a bunch of different versions.  Get the gen2 switches, they're the latest and are really nice.  And IMO avoid the analog version.  It's more expensive, and the analog feature has a lot of mixed reviews.  I don't know if the switches are identical otherwise, as I've only used the gen2 optical switches.  I'm considering getting a Tartarus Pro that comes with the V2 analog switches though, and I'll update this review with my thoughts on that if I end up buying it.*Update*I did get the Tartarus Pro, as well as another Huntsman V2 TKL for a different PC in my house.  That's how much I liked it.  The Tartarus Pro is very similar.  It's not as quiet, a bit more clicky, but still well within the category of quiet mechanical switches.  I think it has a tad more key travel, but otherwise is very similar to the Huntsman V2.  It's not something everyone would find useful but I'm liking it.  Anyway, if you're debating between the V2 linear switches and the V2 analog, I would lean towards the standard linear switch.  The added functionality you get from the analog seems kinda useless to me.  It's really a no contest kind of decision unless you are very very sure that the analog feature is something you can't live without.",

          "Overall the keyboard is pretty awesome.Gaming was a 5/5 because the switches are quiet and creamy, easy to press and responsive (maybe a little TOO responsive)Ergonomic was a 4/5 because my hand like to hover above the lower left hand side of the keyboard and ctrl keycap has a sharp edge and likes to poke at my palm sometimes.Brightness was a 4/5 because it's not as bright as I'd like and there are some shady areas on the keycaps RGB lighting on the top right hand side of the keyboard, I noticed the same shady areas on the blackwidow v2 that I had as well.But after all said and done, it's compact, leaves me enough room on the desk, sounds great, responsive, RGB has endless colors and has some really good patterns (The ambient lighting is my favorite) and other features you get from Razer Synapse lets you make sure that you know that this keyboard is yours."
